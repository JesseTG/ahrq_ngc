	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Key Question 1: When is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) appropriate for patients with T1-2, N0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are medically operable?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Statement KQ1A</strong>: Any patient with operable stage I NSCLC being considered for SBRT should be evaluated by a thoracic surgeon, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting, to reduce specialty bias.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Strong</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>Moderate</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement KQ1B</strong>: For patients with &quot;standard operative risk&quot; (i.e., with anticipated operative mortality of &amp;lt;1.5%) and stage I NSCLC, SBRT is not recommended as an alternative to surgery outside of a clinical trial. Discussions about SBRT are appropriate, with the disclosure that long-term outcomes with SBRT &amp;gt;3 years are not well-established. For this population, lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation remains the recommended treatment, though a sublobar resection may be considered in select clinical scenarios.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Strong</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>High</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement KQ1C</strong>: For patients with &quot;high operative risk&quot; (i.e., those who cannot tolerate lobectomy, but are candidates for sublobar resection) stage I NSCLC, discussions about SBRT as a potential alternative to surgery are encouraged. Patients should be informed that while SBRT may have decreased risks from treatment in the short term, the longer-term outcomes &amp;gt;3 years are not well-established.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Conditional</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>Moderate</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Key Question 2: When is SBRT appropriate for medically inoperable patients with T1-2, N0 NSCLC</strong></span>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>With centrally located tumors </li>
    <li>With tumors &amp;gt;5 cm in diameter </li>
    <li>Lacking tissue confirmation </li>
    <li>With synchronous primary or multifocal tumors </li>
    <li>Who underwent pneumonectomy and now have a new primary tumor in their remaining lung? </li>
</ul>
<p><em>For patients with centrally located tumors?</em></p>
<p><strong>Statement KQ2A</strong>: SBRT directed towards centrally located lung tumors carries unique and significant risks when compared to treatment directed at peripherally located tumors. The use of 3-fraction regimens should be avoided in this setting. </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Strong</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>High</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement KQ2B</strong>: SBRT directed at central lung tumors should be delivered in 4 or 5 fractions. Adherence to volumetric and maximum dose constraints may optimize the safety profile of this treatment. For central tumors for which SBRT is deemed too high-risk, hypofractionated radiation therapy utilizing 6 to 15 fractions can be considered.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Conditional</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>Moderate</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>For patients with tumors &amp;gt;5 cm in diameter?</em></p>
<p><strong>Statement KQ2C</strong>: SBRT is an appropriate option for tumors &amp;gt;5 cm in diameter with an acceptable therapeutic ratio. Adherence to volumetric and maximum dose constraints may optimize the safety profile of this treatment.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Conditional</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>Low</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>For patients lacking tissue confirmation?</em></p>
<p><strong>Statement KQ2D</strong>: Whenever possible, obtain a biopsy prior to treatment with SBRT to confirm a histologic diagnosis of a malignant lung nodule.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Strong</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>High</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement KQ2E</strong>: SBRT can be delivered in patients who refuse a biopsy, have undergone non-diagnostic biopsy, or who are thought to be at prohibitive risk of biopsy. Prior to SBRT in patients lacking tissue confirmation of malignancy, patients are recommended to be discussed in a multidisciplinary manner with a consensus that the lesion is radiographically and clinically consistent with a malignant lung lesion based on tumor, patient, and environmental factors.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Strong</strong> </li>
    <li>Quality of evidence: <strong>Moderate</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>For patients with synchronous primary or multifocal tumors?</em></p>
<p><strong>Statement KQ2F</strong>: Multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC) can be difficult to differentiate from intrathoracic metastatic lung cancer and pose unique issues for parenchymal preservation, therefore it is recommended that they are evaluated by a multidisciplinary team.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation strength: <strong>Strong</strong> </li>

<p>A systematic literature review formed the basis of the guideline. An analytic framework incorporating the population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO) was used to develop search strategies in MEDLINE PubMed for each key question (KQ). The searches identified English-language studies between January 1995 and November 2015 that evaluated adults with T1-2 N0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving primary or salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The search was later extended until August 3, 2016. Both MeSH terms and text words were utilized and terms common to all searches included: <em>lung cancer; non-small cell lung cancer; lung neoplasms[MeSH]; carcinoma, non-small-cell lung[MeSH]; lung carcinoma; stereotactic body radiation therapy; stereotactic body radiotherapy; stereotactic ablative radiation therapy; stereotactic ablative radiotherapy; SBRT; and SABR</em>. Additional terms specific to the KQs were also incorporated. The outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence rates, acute and late toxicity, and quality of life. The electronic searches were supplemented by hand searches.</p>
<p>A total of 402 abstracts were retrieved and screened by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) staff then by the task force. Subsequently, 230 articles were eliminated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: age &amp;ge;18 years, early stage lung cancer, treatment with SBRT, and publication date 1995 to 2016. The exclusion criteria were: small cell lung cancer, node positive or metastatic lung cancer, pediatric patients, pre-clinical or non-human studies, dosimetric studies without clinical outcomes, non-English language, and otherwise not relevant to the KQs. Major studies presented as abstracts but not yet published are discussed in the narrative but were not used to support the recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Board of Directors approved creation of an evidence-based guideline on SBRT for early stage lung cancer in June 2015. A task force of radiation oncologists specializing in lung cancer, along with surgical representatives, was recruited. A patient representative was also included. The members were drawn from academic settings, community practice, and residency.</p>
<p>Through a series of conference calls and emails, the task force and the ASTRO staff completed the systematic review, created evidence tables, and formulated the recommendation statements and narratives for the guideline. The task force members were divided into writing groups by key question (KQ) according to their areas of interest and expertise.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Grading of Evidence and Recommendations and Consensus Methodology</strong></span></p>
<p>Guideline recommendation statements were developed based on the current literature using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, which is an explicit, systematic approach to defining the recommendation strength and quality of evidence. When available, high-quality data formed the basis of the statements in accordance with Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards. When necessary, expert opinion supplemented the evidence.</p>
<p>Consensus within the task force on the recommendation statements was evaluated through a modified Delphi approach adapted from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) process. In an online survey, task force members rated their agreement with each recommendation on a five-point Likert scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The patient representative abstained from rating KQ 3E because she was not comfortable doing so. A pre-specified threshold of &amp;ge;75% of raters selecting &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree&quot; indicated when consensus was achieved. If a recommendation statement did not meet this threshold, it was modified and re-surveyed or excluded from the guideline. Recommendation statements achieving consensus that were modified after the first round were also re-surveyed.</p></div>"/>

    <li>An emerging body of literature has demonstrated overall survival (OS) rates of 76% to 86% at three years following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in select cohorts of operable patients who have declined surgery (see Table 1 in the supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Moreover, a pooled analysis of two prematurely closed phase III trials suggested superior OS at three years with SBRT versus surgery. While neither of these studies provides the assurance that SBRT offers similar survival to surgery beyond three years, the data suggest some equipoise and support recruitment of patients for enrollment in randomized studies that compare SBRT to surgery. </li>
    <li>Adhering to protocol dose constraints such as those used in RTOG 0813 may reduce the risk of severe toxicity. </li>
    <li>For patients disposed to aggressive treatment, SBRT may be beneficial for preserving pulmonary parenchyma while still delivering ablative therapy to the target lesion(s). </li>

    <li>Treatment of peripheral lesions may result in rare but potentially serious toxicities. Damage to the chest wall may be expressed as skin, soft tissue, bone, and neurologic symptoms. Neuropathic pain and rib fractures may occur with 10% to 15% of treatments targeting tumors abutting the chest wall, although symptoms are generally modest and they are predicted by chest wall dose volume metrics. Skin ulcers, brachial plexopathy, and bronchial or esophageal fistulas have been reported, though these are extremely uncommon, and their risk is modifiable during the planning process when identified. </li>
    <li>In one study, after a median follow-up of 17.5 months, 8 patients (11.4%) experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events, including declines in pulmonary function, pleural effusion, and pneumonia. Six patients (8.6%) may have died (grade 5 toxicity) as a consequence of treatment due to fatal hemoptysis, infectious pneumonia, and pericardial effusion. Other retrospective studies have also reported severe toxicities and fatal complications following stereotactic or hypofractionated radiation therapy directed at central tumors. These include potentially devastating toxicities, such as tracheal or great vessel rupture, esophageal ulceration, and spinal cord myelopathy. </li>
    <li>Interpretation of surveillance imaging following SBRT is challenging and may lead to unnecessary biopsies, salvage surgery, or false reassurance that the tumor has not relapsed. </li>
    <li>Salvage surgery in the setting of post-SBRT progression may be technically challenging and pose increased operative risk compared to up-front surgery in a non-irradiated field, particularly in the case of central tumors. </li>

    <li>Regardless of clinical scenario, the task force uniformly recommends multidisciplinary review of all patients under consideration for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), including input from thoracic surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and/or pulmonologists, ideally in a multidisciplinary tumor board or clinic, and consideration of enrollment on clinical trials for all eligible patients. Although extending survival and providing optimal local control (LC) are often seen as the most important goals of cancer treatment, patients should nonetheless be engaged in the treatment decision-making process to ensure that their treating physician understands each individual's risk tolerance and goals of care. Toxicity, pain, and other side-effects impact quality of life (QOL) differently for each patient. Thus, individual goals and QOL should be considered by all disciplines when making treatment recommendations. </li>
