	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>EE: Rest Periods in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill Adults</strong></p>
<p>The registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should aim for a 30-minute rest period before starting a measurement of resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a healthy adult or those with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If this is not possible, a 20-minute rest period may be sufficient. Research primarily in healthy adults showed that resting condition is achieved by the 30th minute of reclined rest, but studies that measured shorter rest times indicate that resting condition can occur in as little as 20 minutes in many adults. Individuals who move during the rest recovery time do not achieve a resting state by 20 minutes and may not be at complete rest at 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: Rest Periods in Healthy Children</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should aim for a 30-minute rest period before starting a measurement of RMR in a healthy child. However, if the child cannot cooperate with both a pre-measurement rest and rest during measurement, the RDN may choose to forego the pre-measurement rest period, initiate the RMR measurement immediately and then discard the first 10 minutes of data. Research in healthy children indicates that when doing so, RMR values recorded at the 20th minute of the measurement may be most indicative of rest in children. With this approach, limited evidence suggests that data recorded after the 10th minute are not significantly different from data at 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Resting Activities in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should ensure healthy adults rest quietly and not engage in any activity during the 30-minute rest period. Some data suggest activities such as laughing, reading, or listening to music may increase RMR.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>EE: Body Positions in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Body Positions in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill Adults</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should conduct RMR measurements in a healthy and non-critically ill adult in the supine position when possible. Research indicates that different postures affect RMR. One study of older patients measured prior to an elective thoracotomy reported that RMR was not significantly different in the 30-degree head-of-bed elevation compared to the supine position. In healthy individuals, three studies reported that sitting RMR was greater than supine RMR and standing RMR was greater than sitting RMR.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Gas Collection Devices in Healthy Adults and Children</strong></p>
<p>The RDN may select any gas collection device (ventilated hood and canopy, mouthpiece and nose clip or face mask) for an RMR measurement in a healthy adult or child. Studies comparing the use of different devices are conflicting. The individual's comfort or preference should be considered when selecting a device, if possible.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Diurnal Variation in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>The RDN may conduct a measurement of RMR at any time of day in a healthy adult, as long as resting conditions can be achieved. Limited evidence indicates that diurnal variation has minimal effect on RMR in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>EE: Room Conditions in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Room Temperature in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should minimize the effect of ambient temperature on RMR in a healthy adult, by keeping the room temperature between 22&amp;deg;C to 25&amp;deg;C (72&amp;deg;F to 77&amp;deg;F) or providing a blanket during the measurement. RMR measurements conducted at room temperatures 20&amp;deg;C or 68&amp;deg;F or less were higher than those conducted at 22&amp;deg;C to 25&amp;deg;C (72&amp;deg;F to 77&amp;deg;F). The use of a blanket minimized this increase. No studies were found that evaluated the effect of increased room temperature more than 25&amp;deg;C or 77&amp;deg;F on RMR.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: Noise Conditions in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill Adults and Children</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should measure RMR in a healthy or non-critically ill adult or child in a quiet room. Noise could adversely affect the measurement.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>EE: Fasting in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Fasting Requirements in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>Prior to measurement of RMR, the RDN should ensure a healthy adult has fasted at least seven hours to minimize the thermic effect of feeding (TEF). Research in healthy adults indicates that the TEF dissipates depending on the amount of calories consumed. The TEF for meals containing approximately 450 kcal to 1,500 kcal is still present at three to five hours. One study reported that the thermic effect of consuming 1,300 kcal was negligible after seven hours post-consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: Exceptions to Fasting Requirements in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If a seven-hour fast is not clinically feasible prior to measurement of RMR in a healthy adult, the RDN should instruct the individual that a small meal (300 kcal or less) may be consumed four hours prior to the measurement. One study reported that the TEF, when consuming approximately 300 kcal, was negligible after 3.5 hours post-consumption in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Caffeine and Stimulants in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should ensure that a healthy adult refrains from ingesting caffeine or other stimulants for at least four hours prior to an RMR measurement. Ingestion of caffeine and other stimulants in healthy adults increases RMR for longer than four hours.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Smoking and Nicotine in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If a healthy adult uses nicotine products, the RDN should ask the individual to abstain from such products for longer than 140 minutes prior to an RMR measurement. Limited research in healthy adult cigarette smokers indicates that there is a significant acute increase in RMR for at least 140 minutes after smoking. No studies evaluated the use of other nicotine-containing products.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>EE: Physical Activity in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Very Light Intensity Physical Activity in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If a healthy adult engages in very light intensity physical activity (e.g., getting dressed, driving, walking less than five minutes, etc.) prior to an RMR measurement, the RDN should ensure a 30-minute rest period prior to the RMR measurement. Limited evidence in healthy adults reported that 30 minutes of rest is required for RMR to return to baseline after minimal activity.</p>
<p><strong>Weak</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>EE: Light to Vigorous Intensity Physical Activity in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If a healthy adult engages in light to vigorous intensity physical activity, the RDN should instruct the individual to refrain from physical activity prior to the RMR measurement for a period of time (e.g., 12 to 48 hours for moderate to vigorous physical activity). Physical activity raises the RMR for an unknown period of time in healthy adults after cessation of physical activity. The elevation of metabolic rate will vary based on intensity, type, duration, level of fitness and other factors. Therefore, the length of time that the individual must refrain from physical activity should be determined based on these factors.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Duration of Measurement (Steady State) in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill Adults</strong></p>
<p>When measuring RMR in a healthy or non-critically ill adult, the RDN should discard the data for the first five minutes, and then use a validated steady state definition to determine the duration of the remainder of the measurement. The purpose of the discard period and steady state requirement is to minimize artifact in the measurement. Steady-state definitions vary by measurement length (four to 25 minutes), coefficient of variation (less than 5% to 10%) and combination of gas exchange variables (oxygen uptake [VO<sub>2</sub>], carbon dioxide production [VCO<sub>2</sub>], respiratory quotient [RQ], minute ventilation).</p>

<p><strong>EE: Duration of Measurement (Steady State) in Healthy Children</strong></p>
<p>When measuring RMR in a healthy child who is unable to rest, the RDN should include the rest period in the measurement, discard the first 10 minutes of data and then continue measurement until a steady state is achieved. With this approach, limited evidence in healthy children suggests that data recorded after the 10th minute are not significantly different from data at 30 minutes; data averaged around the 20th minute have the least variability.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>EE: Respiratory Quotient (RQ) in Healthy and Non-Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: RQ below 0.67 or Above 1.3 in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If the RQ falls outside the physiologic range (below 0.67 or above 1.3) in a healthy adult, the RDN should suspect an error and repeat the RMR measurement. The physiologic range of RQ reflecting cellular metabolism across the fed and fasted state is 0.67 to 1.3.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>EE: RQ between 0.67 and 0.90 in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If the RQ falls between 0.67 and 0.90 in a healthy adult, the RDN should accept the measurement because RQ values within this range cannot reliably be used to detect feeding protocol violations. RQ varies among healthy adults and the range of RQ between fed and fasted states overlaps. In individuals who fasted seven to 14 hours, research reports that RQ ranged from 0.68 to 0.90. Yet, in individuals who consumed a meal 2.5 hours prior to measurement, fasting RQ (0.79 to 0.81) increased by only 0.03 to 0.05. Research demonstrates that RQ has poor accuracy to evaluate feeding protocol violations.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: RQ between 0.91 and 1.3 in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>If the RQ is between 0.91 and 1.3 in a healthy adult who has fasted, the RDN should suspect a problem and consider repeating the measurement. An RQ between 0.91 and 1.3 could be observed in an individual who has not fasted. However, it could also be due to an error in calibration, a leak in the calorimeter, a ventilation problem or some other artifact or protocol violation.</p>

<p><strong>Conditional vs Imperative Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations are categorized in terms of either <strong><em>conditional</em></strong> or <strong><em>imperative</em></strong> statements. While conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their application.</p>
<p>Conditional recommendations are presented in an if/then format, such that:</p>
<p>If CONDITION then ACTION(S) because REASON(S)</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the condition triggers one or more guideline-specified actions. In contrast, imperative recommendations include terms such as &quot;require,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; and &quot;should,&quot; and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances.</p>

<p>The following list provides an overview of the steps which the Academy evidence analysis team goes through to identify research through database searches.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li><strong>Plan the search strategy</strong> to identify the current best evidence relevant to the question. The plan for identification and inclusion of articles and reports should be systematic and reproducible, not haphazard. Write out the original search strategy and document adjustments to the strategy if they occur. Allow for several iterations of searches.
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li><strong>List inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>. The work group will define the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria will be used in defining the search strategy and for filtering the identified research reports. The Academy uses only peer-reviewed research; that is, articles accepted for evidence analysis must be peer-reviewed and published in a juried publication. Additionally, the Academy only uses human subjects in its research and does not include animal studies in its evidence analysis. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify search words</strong>. During the process of considering outcomes, interventions, nutrition diagnoses, and assessments, the work group may have identified a number of specific terms or factors that were important, but were not included in the actual question. These terms can be used as additional search terms to help identify relevant pieces of research. Both text word search and keyword search using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) definitions may be used. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify databases to search</strong>. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Agricola, DARE, TRIP, AHRQ and ERIC are some common databases for clinical nutritional research. Note that search terms can vary depending on the database. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conduct the search</strong>. Depending on the number and type of sources found in the initial search, adjustments might have to be made in the search strategy and to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and additional searches run. Changes to the search plan should be recorded for future reference. Document the number of sources identified in each search. </li>
    <li><strong>Review titles and abstracts</strong>. At this point, a filtering procedure is used to determine whether a research article matches the inclusion criteria and is relevant to the work group's questions. Typically, the lead analyst, along with a member of the expert workgroup, first reviews the citations and abstracts to filter out reports that are not applicable to the question. If a determination cannot be made based on the citation and abstract, then the full text of the article is obtained for review. </li>
    <li><strong>Gather all remaining articles and reports</strong>. Obtain paper or electronic copies of research articles that remain on the list following the citation and abstract review. If there are less than six citations, it could mean that the search was too specific to identify relevant research or that research has not been done on this topic. A broadened search should be tried. When there is a long list of citations, ascertain whether it includes articles that are tangential to the question or address the question in only a general way. In this case a more focused search strategy may be necessary. </li>

<p>The expert work group, which includes practitioners and researchers with a depth of experience in the specific field of interest, develops the disease-specific guideline. The guideline development involves the following steps:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li><strong>Review the Conclusion Statements</strong>: The work group meets to review the materials resulting from the evidence analysis, which may include conclusion statements, evidence summaries, and evidence worksheets. </li>
    <li><strong>Formulate Recommendations for the Guideline Integrating Conclusions from Evidence Analysis</strong>: The work group uses an expert consensus method to formulate the guideline recommendations and complete the various sections on the recommendation page. These include:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li><strong>Recommendation(s)</strong>: This is a course of action for the practitioner. The recommendation is written using two brief and separate statements. The first statement is &quot;what&quot; the dietitian should do or not do. The second statement describes the &quot;why&quot; of the recommendation. More than one recommendation may be formulated depending on a particular topic and the supporting conclusion statements. </li>
        <li><strong>Rating</strong>: The rating for the recommendation is based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The grade of the supporting conclusion statement(s) will help determine this rating (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). </li>
        <li><strong>Label of Conditional or Imperative</strong>: Each recommendation will have a label of &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;imperative.&quot; Conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, while imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population without restraints on their pertinence. </li>
        <li><strong>Risks and Harms of Implementing the Recommendations</strong>: Includes any potential risks, anticipated harms or adverse consequences associated with applying the recommendation(s) to the target population. </li>
        <li><strong>Conditions of Application</strong>: Includes any organizational barriers or changes that would need to be made within an organization to apply the recommendation in daily practice. Also includes any conditions which may limit the application of the recommendation(s). For instance, application may be limited to only people in an inpatient setting, or not applicable for pregnant women. Facilitators for the application of the guideline may also be listed here. Conditional recommendations will always have conditions specified. Imperative recommendations may have some general conditions for application. </li>
        <li><strong>Potential Costs Associated with Application</strong>: Includes any costs that may be associated with the application of this recommendation such as specialized staff, new equipment or treatments. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Narrative</strong>: Provides a brief description of the evidence that supports this recommendation. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong>: Provides a brief list of the evidence strength and methodological issues that determined the recommendation strength. </li>
        <li><strong>Minority Opinions</strong>: If the expert work group cannot reach consensus on the recommendation, the minority opinions may be listed here. </li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Evidence</strong>: Provides links to the conclusions statements, evidence summaries and worksheets related to the formulation of this recommendation(s). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process</strong>: Recommendations are based on the summarized evidence from the analysis. Sources that are not analyzed during the evidence analysis process may be used to support and formulate the recommendation or to support information under other categories on the recommendation page, if the workgroup deems necessary. References must be credible resources (e.g., consensus reports, other guidelines, position papers, standards of practice, articles from peer-reviewed journals, nationally recognized documents or websites). If recommendations are based solely on these types of references, they will be rated as &quot;consensus.&quot; Occasionally recommendations will include references that were not reviewed during the evidence analysis process but are relevant to the recommendation, risks and harms of implementing the recommendation, conditions of application, or potential costs associated with application. These references will be listed on the recommendation page under &quot;References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process.&quot; </li>
    <li><strong>Develop a Clinical Algorithm for The Guideline</strong>: The workgroup develops a clinical algorithm based on Academy's Nutrition Care Process, to display how each recommendation can be used within the treatment process and how they relate to the Nutrition Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete the Writing of the Guideline</strong>: Each disease-specific guideline has a similar format which incorporates the Introduction (includes: Scope of the Guideline, Statement of Intent, Guideline Methods, Implementation, Benefits and Risks/Harms of Implementation), Background Information and any necessary Appendices. The work group develops these features. </li>
    <li><strong>Criteria Used in Guideline Development</strong>: The criteria used in determining the format and process for development of Academy's guidelines are based on the following tools and criteria for evidence-based guidelines:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Guideline Elements Model (GEM) which has been incorporated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a Standard Specification for clinical practice guidelines. </li>
        <li>Appraisal for Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument </li>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Safety issues should be considered for each recommendation. </li>
    <li>Failure to measure the resting metabolic rate (RMR) accurately may result in incorrect diagnosis of the energy state, inaccurate therapy for patients who want to gain or lose body weight, or overfeeding or underfeeding of healthy and non-critically ill individuals. </li>
    <li>Not following the guideline may result in inappropriate nutrition care plans, due to inaccurate RMR measurement. </li>
    <li>When applying the recommendation to children, the child's age should be considered, due to variability in physical and developmental attributes. </li>
    <li>Clinical judgment should be used in applying these recommendations to individuals other than the populations specified in each recommendation, since limited evidence exists in children and across the spectrum of healthy and non-critically ill adults. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Factors That Decrease the Accuracy of Indirect Calorimetry Measurements</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Mechanical ventilation with fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>) &amp;ge;60% </li>
    <li>Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) &amp;gt;12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O </li>
    <li>Hyperventilation or hypoventilation </li>
    <li>Sampling system leak </li>
    <li>Excessive moisture in the indirect calorimetry system </li>
    <li>Failure to collect all expiratory flow (e.g., bronchopleural fistula, chest tube leak, etc.) </li>
    <li>Supplemental oxygen in spontaneously breathing patients </li>
    <li>Hemodialysis in progress </li>
    <li>Calibration errors </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation-Specific Risks/Harms</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Caffeine and Stimulants in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>A four-hour abstinence from caffeine or other stimulants may be difficult for some individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Smoking and Nicotine in Healthy Adults</strong></p>
<p>Abstaining from nicotine products for more than 140 minutes may be difficult for some individuals.</p></div>"/>

    <li>This nutrition practice guideline is meant to serve as a general framework for handling clients with particular health problems. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. </li>
    <li>While evidence-based nutrition practice guidelines represent a statement of best practice based on the latest available evidence at the time of publishing, they are not intended to overrule professional judgment. Rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. These nutrition practice guidelines are provided with the express understanding that they do not establish or specify particular standards of care, whether legal, medical or other. </li>
    <li>This guideline recognizes the role of patient preferences for possible outcomes of care, when the appropriateness of a clinical intervention involves a substantial element of personal choice or values. With regard to types of evidence that are associated with particular outcomes, two major classes have been described. Patient-oriented evidence that matters (POEM) deals with outcomes of importance to patients, such as changes in morbidity, mortality or quality of life. Disease-oriented evidence (DOE) deals with surrogate end-points, such as changes in laboratory values or other measures of response. Although the results of DOE sometimes parallel the results of POEM, they do not always correspond. When possible, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends using POEM-type evidence rather than DOE. When DOE is the only guidance available, the guideline indicates that key clinical recommendations lack the support of outcomes evidence. </li>

    <field fieldid="131" ordby="1010" id="436" name="Description of Implementation Strategy" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The publication of this guideline is an integral part of the plans for getting the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics evidence-based recommendations on Measuring Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) in the Healthy and Non-Critically Ill to all dietetics practitioners engaged in, teaching about or researching critical illness as quickly as possible. National implementation workshops at various sites around the country and during the Academy Food Nutrition Conference Expo (FNCE) are planned. Additionally, there are recommended dissemination and adoption strategies for local use of the Academy's Measuring RMR in the Healthy and Non-Critically Ill Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline.</p>
<p>The guideline development team recommended multi-faceted strategies to disseminate the guideline and encourage its implementation. Management support and learning through social influence are likely to be effective in implementing guidelines in dietetic practice. However, additional interventions may be needed to achieve real change in practice routines.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Measuring RMR in the Healthy and Non-Critically Ill Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline will be achieved by announcement at professional events, presentations and training.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>National and local events</strong>: State dietetic association meetings and media coverage will help launch the guideline. </li>
    <li><strong>Local feedback adaptation</strong>: Presentation by members of the work group at peer review meetings and opportunities for continuing education units (CEUs) for courses completed. </li>
    <li><strong>Education initiatives</strong>: The guideline and supplementary resources will be freely available for use in the education and training of dietetic interns and students in approved Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) programs. </li>
    <li><strong>Champions</strong>: Local champions will be identified and expert members of the guideline team will prepare articles for publications. Resources will be provided that include PowerPoint presentations, full guidelines and pre-prepared case studies. </li>
    <li><strong>Practical tools</strong>: Some of the tools that will be developed to help implement the guideline include specially designed resources such as clinical algorithms, a toolkit, and a slide presentation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific distribution strategies include:</p>
<p><strong>Publication in full</strong>: The guideline will be available electronically at the <a href=&quot;http://www.andeal.org/default.cfm?&quot; title=&quot;AND Evidence Analysis Library Web site&quot;>Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site</a> and will be announced to all Academy Dietetic Practice Groups. The Academy Evidence Analysis Library will also provide downloadable supporting information.</p></div>"/>
