	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>At the time of resection of suspected bladder cancer, a clinician should perform a thorough cystoscopic examination of a patient's entire urethra and bladder that evaluates and documents tumor size, location, configuration, number, and mucosal abnormalities. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>At initial diagnosis of a patient with bladder cancer, a clinician should perform complete visual resection of the bladder tumor(s), when technically feasible. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>A clinician should perform upper urinary tract imaging as a component of the initial evaluation of a patient with bladder cancer. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with a history of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with normal cystoscopy and positive cytology, a clinician should consider prostatic urethral biopsies and upper tract imaging, as well as enhanced cystoscopic techniques (blue light cystoscopy, when available), ureteroscopy, or random bladder biopsies. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Risk Stratification</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>At the time of each occurrence/recurrence, a clinician should assign a clinical stage and classify a patient accordingly as &quot;low-,&quot; &quot;intermediate-,&quot; or &quot;high-risk.&quot; (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Variant Histologies</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>An experienced genitourinary pathologist should review the pathology of a patient with any doubt in regards to variant or suspected variant histology (e.g., micropapillary, nested, plasmacytoid, neuroendocrine, sarcomatoid), extensive squamous or glandular differentiation, or the presence/absence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI). (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>If a bladder sparing approach is being considered in a patient with variant histology, then a clinician should perform a restaging transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) within four to six weeks of the initial TURBT. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Due to the high rate of upstaging associated with variant histology, a clinician should consider offering initial radical cystectomy. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

    <li>In a patient with a history of low-risk cancer and a normal cystoscopy, a clinician should not routinely use a urinary biomarker or cytology during surveillance. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with NMIBC, a clinician may use biomarkers to assess response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (UroVysion&amp;reg; FISH) and adjudicate equivocal cytology (UroVysion&amp;reg; FISH and ImmunoCyt&amp;trade;). (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

    <li>In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection (not all visible tumor treated), a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with high-risk, high-grade Ta tumors, a clinician should consider performing repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with T1 disease, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site to include muscularis propria within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;15&quot;>
    <li>In a patient with suspected or known low- or intermediate-risk bladder cancer, a clinician should consider administration of a single postoperative instillation of intravesical chemotherapy (e.g., mitomycin C or epirubicin) within 24 hours of TURBT. In a patient with a suspected perforation or extensive resection, a clinician should not use postoperative chemotherapy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a low-risk patient, a clinician should not administer induction intravesical therapy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In an intermediate-risk patient a clinician should consider administration of a six-week course of induction intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a high-risk patient with newly diagnosed carcinoma <em>in situ</em> (CIS), high-grade T1, or high-risk Ta urothelial carcinoma, a clinician should administer a six-week induction course of BCG. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In an intermediate-risk patient who completely responds to an induction course of intravesical chemotherapy, a clinician may utilize maintenance therapy. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In an intermediate-risk patient who completely responds to induction BCG, a clinician should consider maintenance BCG for one year, as tolerated. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a high-risk patient who completely responds to induction BCG, a clinician should continue maintenance BCG for three years, as tolerated. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>BCG Relapse and Salvage Regimens</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
    <li>In an intermediate- or high-risk patient with persistent or recurrent disease or positive cytology following intravesical therapy, a clinician should consider performing prostatic urethral biopsy and an upper tract evaluation prior to administration of additional intravesical therapy. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In an intermediate- or high-risk patient with persistent or recurrent Ta or CIS disease after a single course of induction intravesical BCG, a clinician should offer a second course of BCG. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient fit for surgery with high-grade T1 disease after a single course of induction intravesical BCG, a clinician should offer radical cystectomy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>A clinician should not prescribe additional BCG to a patient who is intolerant of BCG or has documented recurrence on TURBT of high-grade, non-muscle-invasive disease and/or CIS within six months of two induction courses of BCG or induction BCG plus maintenance. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with persistent or recurrent intermediate- or high-risk NMIBC who is unwilling or unfit for cystectomy following two courses of BCG, a clinician may recommend clinical trial enrollment. A clinician may offer this patient intravesical chemotherapy when clinical trials are unavailable. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Role of Cystectomy in NMIBC</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;27&quot;>
    <li>In a patient with Ta low- or intermediate-risk disease, a clinician should not perform radical cystectomy until bladder-sparing modalities (staged TURBT, intravesical therapies) have failed. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a high-risk patient who is fit for surgery with persistent high-grade T1 disease on repeat resection, or T1 tumors with associated CIS, LVI, or variant histologies, a clinician should consider offering initial radical cystectomy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a high-risk patient with persistent or recurrent disease within one year following treatment with two induction cycles of BCG or BCG maintenance, a clinician should offer radical cystectomy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;30&quot;>
    <li>In a patient with NMIBC, a clinician should offer blue light cystoscopy at the time of TURBT, if available, to increase detection and decrease recurrence. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with NMIBC, a clinician may consider use of narrow-band imaging (NBI) to increase detection and decrease recurrence. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C</em></strong>) </li>

<p>The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed in part through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and through additional supplementation that further addressed additional key questions and more recently published literature. A research librarian experienced in conducting literature searches for comparative effectiveness reviews searched in Ovid MEDLINE (January 1990&amp;ndash;October 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through September 2014), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through September 2014), Health Technology Assessment (through 3rd Quarter, 2014), National Health Sciences Economic Evaluation Database (through 3rd Quarter, 2014), and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (through 3rd Quarter, 2014) to capture both published and grey literature. Reference lists and previous systematic reviews were also reviewed for additional studies. Database searches resulted in 3,740 potentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts and titles, 643 articles were selected for full-text dual review, and 149 studies (in 192 publications) were determined to meet inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The AHRQ review was then updated by a consultant methodologist though September 2, 2015. Reference lists and previous systematic reviews were also reviewed for additional studies. This supplementation added 29 studies to the completed systematic review used in the creation of guideline statements.</p></div>"/>

<p>For treatment studies, the following information was extracted into evidence tables: study design, setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose and duration of treatment for experimental and control groups, duration of follow-up, number of subjects screened, eligible and enrolled population characteristics (including age, race, sex, stage of disease, and functional status), results, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and sources of funding. Relative risks and associated 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on the information provided (sample sizes and incidence of outcomes in each intervention group). Discrepancies between calculated and reported results were noted when present.</p>
<p>For diagnostic accuracy studies, the following information was abstracted: setting, screening test or tests, method of data collection, reference standard, inclusion criteria, population characteristics (including age, sex, race, smoking status, signs or symptoms, and prior bladder cancer stage or grade), proportion of individuals with bladder cancer, bladder cancer stage and grade, definition of a positive screening exam, proportion of individuals unexaminable by the screening test, proportion who did not undergo reference standard, results, and sources of funding. When possible, two-by-two tables were created from information provided (sample size, prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity) and compared to calculated measures of diagnostic accuracy based on the two-by-two tables with reported results. Discrepancies between calculated and reported results were noted when present. Data extraction for each study was completed by one investigator and independently reviewed for accuracy and completeness by a second investigator.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of the Risk of Bias of Individual Studies</span></strong> </p>
<p>Risk of bias was assessed for randomized trials and observational studies using criteria adapted from those developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Studies of diagnostic accuracy were rated using criteria adapted from Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2. These criteria were applied in conjunction with the approaches recommended in the <a href=&quot;https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/60/318/CER-Methods-Guide-140109.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AHRQ Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>AHRQ Methods Guide for Medical Interventions</a> and the <a href=&quot;https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/246/558/Methods-Guide-for-Medical-Test-Reviews_Full-Guide_20120530.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AHRQ Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>AHRQ Methods Guide for Medical Test Reviews</a>. Two investigators independently assessed the risk of bias of each study. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Each study was rated as &quot;low,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; or &quot;high&quot; risk of bias.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Determination of Evidence Strength</strong></span></p>
<p>The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies. Evidence strength refers to the body of evidence available for a particular question and includes not only individual study quality but consideration of study design, consistency of findings across studies, adequacy of sample sizes, and generalizability of samples, settings, and treatments for the purposes of the guideline. See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field for the categories of the body of evidence.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The most common side effects of single instillation postoperative chemotherapy are irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, but severe complications have been reported in patients with drug extravasation. Thus, immediate intravesical chemotherapy should be avoided when transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is extensive, perforation is suspected, significant bleeding requires bladder irrigations, or the tumor appears invasive. </li>
    <li>Protein-based urine markers have a tendency to be falsely positive in the presence of inflammation, resulting in lower specificity than urine cytology. This can result in subjecting patients to unnecessary diagnostic evaluations. </li>
    <li>Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has a greater risk of adverse events, both local (granulomatous cystitis, dysuria, hematuria) and systemic (fever), as compared to most intravesical chemotherapies. Approximately 70% of patients receiving BCG complain of side effects with 8% of these being severe enough to discontinue treatment. The toxicity of long-term maintenance and the lack of high-quality studies to support the value of more prolonged maintenance over a re-induction course at the time of relapse have led some to question the routine use of a three-year maintenance program, especially in lower risk patients. In a sub-group analysis of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30962, three years of full dose maintenance was not superior to one year of full dose maintenance in an intermediate-risk group (as defined by a progression risk score of &amp;le;6 and a recurrence score of &amp;le;9 using the EORTC risk calculator). </li>
    <li>The potential benefits of timely, upfront radical cystectomy need to be weighed against the risks associated with cystectomy, such as complications, morbidity, and decreased quality of life for any given patient. Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion has considerable morbidity, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, infectious and wound-related complications totaling over 60% within 90 days of surgery, even in high-volume centers of excellence and regardless of open versus robotic approaches. Mortality after radical cystectomy is typically &amp;lt;5%, but may increase substantially in the elderly with 90-day mortality rates over 10% in patients &amp;gt;75 years of age and almost 20% in octogenarians. Thus, the risks of radical cystectomy and urinary diversion must be weighed and balanced carefully against the risks of disease progression and potential loss of the opportunity for cure in high-risk patients. </li>
    <li>Life-long surveillance in the absence of documented recurrence subjects a patient to repeated anxiety, discomfort, and the small risk of infection or bleeding associated with cystoscopic surveillance of the bladder. </li>
    <li>The magnitude of benefit or risk/burdens, and the Panel's judgment regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens are taken into account for each guideline statement. Refer to the original guideline document for additional discussion of evidence of harms for specific statements. </li>

    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses ('off label') that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not in-tended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
