	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Acetaminophen and Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;14&quot;>
    <li>In patients with no contraindications to pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should consider acetaminophen or oral NSAIDs as first line treatment. <strong>[B]</strong> </li>
    <li>Clinicians should ensure that patients receive no more than four grams of acetaminophen daily from all sources of prescribed and non-prescribed medications. <strong>[A]</strong> </li>
    <li>In patients requiring treatment with oral NSAIDs and who are at high risk for serious adverse upper gastrointestinal (GI) events, clinicians should consider the addition of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol. <strong>[A]</strong> </li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Intra-articular Injections (Corticosteroids and Hyaluronic Acid)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
    <li>For patients with symptomatic OA of the knee, clinicians may consider intra-articular corticosteroid injection. <strong>[C]</strong> </li>

    <li>For patients with OA of the hip and/or knee, who experience joint symptoms (such as pain, stiffness, and reduced function) with substantial impact on their quality of life (individualized based upon patient assessment), and who have not benefited from the core non-surgical therapies, clinicians may offer referral for joint replacement surgery. <strong>[B]</strong> </li>
    <li>In patients with OA of the hip and/or knee considered for surgical consultations, clinicians should obtain weight-bearing plain radiographs within 6 months prior to the referral to surgical consultation. <strong>[B]</strong> </li>
    <li>In candidates for joint replacement of the hip and/or knee, joint injections should not be given into the involved joint if surgery is anticipated within three months. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Key Question Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>Following a series of discussions on the highest priority topics related to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations regarding osteoarthritis (OA), the Champions, in consultation with the Work Group, identified a set of 19 key questions to guide the systematic review of the literature. The key questions followed the industry standard population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 in the original guideline document provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. Lewin described this method in detail during the biweekly teleconference held with the Champions and guided them into identifying and prioritizing topics of interest for this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG).</p>
<p>The key questions, listed in Table A-2 in the original guideline document, cover the following topics:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Diagnosis and evaluation of OA </li>
    <li>Comparative effectiveness of drugs for OA </li>
    <li>Comparative effectiveness of non-pharmacologic therapies </li>
    <li>Comparative effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine </li>
    <li>Surgical referral </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The methods guiding this systematic review are described below. In part, these methods follow the guidelines for conducting a systematic review set forth by AHRQ in the <em>Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews</em>. The methods also follow the guidance set forth by the VA/DoD in the <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em> document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents field).</p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature consists of several distinct steps. ECRI Institute conducted the evidence review for this CPG, by following the process outlined below:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Defining the inclusion and exclusion search criteria </li>
    <li>Developing a search strategy (i.e., search logic using MeSH [Medical Subject Headings] terminology and key words) </li>
    <li>Screening the results based on abstracts and titles (i.e., identifying relevant studies and excluding duplicate records) </li>
    <li>Reviewing the full text of remaining studies and abstracting relevant data points (i.e., population, comparator, results, etc.) </li>
    <li>Assessing the internal and external validity of abstracted studies </li>
    <li>Summarizing the evidence </li>
    <li>Interpreting the results </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Criteria for Study Inclusion/Exclusion</strong></p>
<p>The inclusion criteria are listed below in separate categories pertaining to the following: general criteria relevant to all studies included in the evidence base; criteria that is specific to studies that address the diagnostic questions; criteria specific to studies that address the pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention questions; and criteria specific to studies that address the referral questions.</p>
<p><em>General Criteria</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinical studies published on or after January 1, 2002, and systematic reviews published on or after January 1, 2008 </li>
    <li>Studies must be published in English </li>
    <li>Publication must be a full-length clinical study or systematic review; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that are not full-length, clinical studies were not accepted as evidence </li>
    <li>Study must have enrolled a patient population in which at least 85 percent of patients had OA (post-traumatic or idiopathic) of the hips or knees </li>
    <li>Studies must have enrolled adults 18 years or older. In studies that mixed adults and children, at least 85 percent of the enrolled patients must have been 18 years or older </li>
    <li>Study included 50 percent or more of patients at final follow-up </li>
    <li>Studies that enrolled adults with osteonecrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other inflammatory joint disease were excluded </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Diagnosis/Evaluation Studies</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Studies must have enrolled &amp;ge;10 patients </li>
    <li>Studies must have linked use of diagnostic technologies with improvement in clinical outcomes. This ideally requires a study that compares clinical outcomes after diagnostic technology evaluation versus clinical evaluation, or compares clinical outcomes linked to different diagnostic technologies </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Intervention Studies</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Study must have evaluated a treatment for OA of the hips or knees </li>
    <li>Study must have been a prospective, randomized or nonrandomized comparative trial with an independent, concurrent control group </li>
    <li>Crossover trials were considered only if data from the first treatment period were reported separately </li>
    <li>Study must have enrolled &amp;ge;25 patients per treatment arm </li>
    <li>The study must report data on at least one of the included outcomes </li>
    <li>Study must have followed patients for at least four weeks </li>
    <li>All subjective outcomes (e.g., pain, aspects of patient function) must be measured using validated instruments </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Referral Studies</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Study must have enrolled &amp;ge;10 patients </li>
    <li>Study must have been a clinical study (comparative or not) that investigated indications for referring patients with OA of the hips or knees for total/partial joint replacement surgery </li>
    <li>Expert opinion papers were not considered as evidence addressing the referral questions </li>
    <li>Study must have reported on the outcomes associated with indications </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additional Criteria for Key Question 18</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Study must have enrolled at least 100 patients </li>
    <li>Study excluded if it only considered non-modifiable patient risk factors, such as gender or age </li>
    <li>Study excluded if outcomes of pain and function are measured prior to six months follow-up </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p><em>MeSH, EMTREE, and Keywords</em></p>
<p>The search strategies employed combinations of free text keywords as well as controlled vocabulary terms including (but not limited to) the concepts shown in the Topic-specific Search Terms table (see Table A-3 in the original guideline document). The strategies in the original guideline document are presented in OVID syntax; the searches were simultaneously conducted across EMBASE and Medline. Similar strategies were used to search the databases comprising PubMed, and the Cochrane Library (see Tables A-3 through A-12 in the original guideline document). Search sets were structured to address specific key questions and/or groups of key questions (i.e., diagnosis/evaluation, pharmacologic management, non-pharmacologic management, complementary and alternative medicine, and referrals). These search results were further refined to capture specific patient outcomes, study designs and publication types.</p>
<p>Published evidence was identified through extensive searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, (via the OVID SP platform using the one-search and de-duplication features), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Health Technology Assessment Database. Searches were designed to identify unique reviews, trials, and technology assessments. Searches of the World Wide Web were also performed to capture relevant grey literature that has not been indexed to the databases listed above. The searches covered the time period of January 2002 through December 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Search Results</strong></p>
<p>Extensive literature searches identified 6,872 citations potentially addressing the key questions of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 5,315 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, published prior to 2002). Overall, 1,557 abstracts were reviewed with 735 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not a systematic review or clinical study, clearly did not address a Key Question of interest to this review, clearly did not report outcomes of interest to this review, or published prior to 2002 for clinical studies or 2008 for systematic reviews. A total of 822 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 459 were excluded at a first pass review for not addressing a key question (mainly because the study did not address a comparison of interest), not reporting on outcomes of interest to the review, not being a full-length systematic review or clinical study, not including the required number of patients, or being a duplicate. A total of 363 full-length articles were thought to address one or more key questions and were further reviewed. Of these, 208 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A-1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Overall, 155 studies addressed one or more of the Key Questions and were considered as evidence in the review. Table A-13 in the original guideline document indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Assessing the Quality of the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The strength of the evidence supporting findings for the outcomes of interest under each key question was assessed using the categories listed in the table below. The Working Group considered the evidence for each outcome according to four core domains, as follows: study quality (internal validity), consistency, directness, and precision. Consistency is the similarity in effect sizes or direction of an effect of different studies in an evidence base. An inconsistent evidence base is one in which the studies report conflicting results. Consistency cannot be assessed when a body of evidence has only a single study (consistency is unknown). Directness refers to whether there is a direct link between the intervention and the ultimate health outcome. An ultimate health outcome (e.g., improved pain) is typically more clinically meaningful than an indirect outcome, and a direct link between outcome and intervention is strongest in head-to-head comparisons. Precision is a measure of the degree of certainty around a single outcome's effect size. In this report, the authors define a &quot;precise&quot; result as one in which the data were informative (e.g., the confidence interval [CI] around the effect size clearly indicated there was a difference between groups) and an &quot;imprecise&quot; result as one in which the data were not informative (e.g., the CI was sufficiently wide that an estimate is consistent with either benefit or no benefit in comparison to another intervention).</p>

<p><strong>Final Evidence Report</strong></p>
<p>The evidence review team at ECRI Institute synthesized the results of the systematic review and provided a detailed analysis of relevant information for each key question. Some of the key elements discussed in the report include the quality of the evidence base and the magnitude of effect of specific interventions. Furthermore, the synthesis report contained critical information on potential limitations of certain studies, allowing for a better understanding of the certainty of the evidence. The review team produced a comprehensive evidence review report and distributed it to the Champions and Work Group members approximately two weeks prior to the face-to-face meeting.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The methodology used in the development of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) for non-surgical management of osteoarthritis (OA) (Version 1.0 - 2014) follows the<em> Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal working document of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence-based Practice Working Group (EBPWG). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the submission of a new CPG (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). </p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group members for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Specifically, the Champions for this CPG were responsible for identifying the key evidence questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for rehabilitation of a patient with an upper extremity amputation. In addition, Champions assisted in:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
    <li>Conducting the evidence review, including providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria </li>
    <li>Assessing the level and quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes </li>
</ol>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the DoD, identified four clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 OA CPG. The Lewin Group (Lewin) and their sub-contractors ECRI Institute and Duty First Consulting held the first conference call for this Guideline in August 2012, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leaders from the VA and DoD evidence-based guideline development program, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing evidence questions for a systematic review on the nonsurgical management of OA. During this call, the team also identified a list, from which the Work Group members were recruited, of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to OA. The specialties areas included are dietetics, family practice, internal medicine, nursing, orthopedics, primary care, pharmacy and rheumatology.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Face-to-Face Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p>In consultation with the COR, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and a half day face-to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members in May 2013. These experts were gathered in order to review the evidence, develop recommendations, and grade the recommendations in accordance with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) methods for assessing and grading the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>During the face-to-face meeting, and under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to review initial recommendations and/or develop new recommendations. In order to accomplish this task, the experts were divided into four smaller subgroups, each of which was led by a Champion. In addition, Work Group members were responsible for assessing the overall strength of evidence for each recommendation, by determining the magnitude and certainty of net benefit.</p>
<p>The recommendations presented in this CPG are based on a systematic appraisal of the published evidence on non-surgical interventions for managing OA. In areas where the evidence is particularly lacking, expert opinion served as the basis for the recommendation.</p>
<p>This CPG is the product of many months of diligent effort and consensus building among knowledgeable individuals from the VHA and the DoD. An experienced moderator facilitated the multidisciplinary Working Group. The draft document was discussed in a face-to-face group meeting. The content and validity of each section was thoroughly reviewed in a series of conference calls.</p>
<p><strong>Grading Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The grade of the recommendation is based on a framework that combines the two dimensions, as shown in the table below. The grade depends on both net benefit and certainty. For example, in the USPSTF grading scheme, a grade of A is assigned to a recommendation that is based on a high certainty of a substantial net benefit. Three combinations of certainty and net benefit can yield a grade of B. Note that, in the USPSTF framework, any recommendation associated with low certainty of net benefit results in a recommendation of I, regardless of the magnitude of net benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Grade of EO for Expert Opinion</strong>: To grade the recommendations for the guideline, the Working Group members used a variation of the USPSTF grading framework to provide a grade of EO for &quot;Expert Opinion.&quot; Given that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have to be used in real practice settings for Veterans and Service Members, a grade of I for insufficient evidence may not provide useful guidance for supporting clinical decisions. In particular, we considered certain instances in which evidence suggests a Substantial or Moderate net benefit, but the certainty/strength of that evidence is Low. In those instances, rather than concluding that the evidence is insufficient to support a clinical decision, we relied on Expert Opinion to support a recommendation. A grade of EO does not imply that the evidence is strong (it is still Low). Rather, it suggests that the magnitude of net benefit (Substantial or Moderate) is of sufficient clinical importance to make a recommendation, even if it is based on Low certainty (weak evidence). The final CPG document represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and clinical practice regarding the non-surgical management of hip and knee OA. It attempts to be as free as possible of bias toward any theoretical or empirical approach to treatment.</p>
<p>Recommendations with grades A or B typically employ the terms &quot;should&quot; or &quot;should consider&quot;, respectively, as it indicates that the certainty of the evidence and magnitude of net benefits is high. Recommendations with a grade C typically use the phrase &quot;may&quot; or &quot;may consider&quot; and recommendations with a grade D use a negative phrase such as &quot;do not&quot;. Recommendations with insufficient evidence are stated as such with no positive or negative implication, while expert opinion recommendations may use any of these phrases. It is important to note that these are merely guidelines and should not be accepted as the rule. For example, some recommendations in this CPG with a C grade, may use the term &quot;should&quot; rather than the more common, &quot;may&quot;. Careful consideration was given by the Champions regarding the terminology used in each recommendation and may not necessarily follow the guidelines as described above.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Long-term use of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is limited by adverse effects such as increased cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, ulceration, and bleeding, and renal impairment. The risks of these complications increase with age, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and probably duration of use. These risks are especially important concerning the typically older population affected by osteoarthritis (OA) who often have comorbidities and take multiple medications. Alternative therapies to reduce these risks are limited. </li>
    <li>All NSAIDs have the potential to increase the risk for cardiovascular (CV) events and therefore should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Naproxen has a neutral or lowest risk for adverse CV events. Use with caution or avoid use of NSAIDs in patients with renal impairment, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, advanced liver diseases, known cardiovascular disease, patients receiving anticoagulants, etc. </li>
    <li>Adverse events associated with topical NSAIDs may be due to components of the formulation rather than the NSAID itself (e.g., unpleasant odor from the dimethyl sulfide metabolite of dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] in diclofenac solution). </li>
    <li>Use of nonselective or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure or other renal-related injury in an estimated one to five percent of patients. All available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events is increased in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in the production of renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion. Patients at higher risk for renal injury from NSAIDs or COX-2s include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics and vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and older patients. </li>
    <li>Although acetaminophen is a relatively safe analgesic when taken in usual doses (up to a maximum of four grams daily), the risk for acute liver injury and liver failure is increased in patients taking doses greater than 4,000 mg daily. </li>
    <li>Duloxetine therapy can be limited by adverse gastrointestinal, central nervous system and other reactions. The most common adverse events in clinical trials were nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, somnolence and constipation. When duloxetine is added on to a NSAID, the incidence of adverse events (i.e., nausea, dry mouth, constipation, fatigue, decreased appetite and dizziness) and withdrawals due to intolerance is slightly to moderately increased relative to those for NSAID therapy alone. </li>
    <li>Some patients may develop physical dependence with regular use and experience withdrawal symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal if tramadol therapy is stopped too quickly. Atypical withdrawal symptoms that may be related to the serotonin&amp;ndash;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) effects (e.g., hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, confusion and unusual sensory experiences such as numbness and tingling in the extremities) may also occur. If tramadol is discontinued, the dose should be slowly tapered off to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The main safety concern with tramadol is development of seizures. Tramadol should be avoided or used with caution in patients with a history or risk of seizures or those who are taking drugs that reduce the seizure threshold, such as antidepressants, anorectics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, tricyclic compounds (such as cyclobenzaprine, promethazine), other opioids, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and neuroleptics. Careful attention should be given to recommended dosage adjustments and maximal dosage limits in at-risk populations (e.g., the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment). </li>
    <li>Adverse events such as endocrine dysfunction and sleep-disordered breathing are associated with long-term opioid therapy in chronic pain. </li>
    <li>Results from two studies showed that oral diclofenac has a higher incidence of adverse GI symptoms, whereas topical diclofenac has a higher incidence of local application site reactions, commonly dry skin, rash, and pruritus. </li>
    <li>Adverse events associated with topical capsaicin are limited to temporary burning, stinging and pain at the site of application. </li>
    <li>Local adverse events are the most commonly reported adverse events from steroid injections. These include pain on injection, redness, post injection flare and skin discoloration. The rate of joint infection is considered to be very low when strict aseptic techniques are followed. Systemic effects include rapid suppression of serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP] and cytokines) returning to baseline levels in one to four weeks. In diabetics, a transient, short-term increase in blood glucose levels has been reported. The evidence for an effect on blood pressure is mixed but facial flushing can occur. </li>

    <li>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines are based upon the best information available at the time of publication. They are designed to provide information and assist decision-making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. </li>
    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. </li>
    <li>Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. </li>
    <li>These guidelines are not intended to represent TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits may be found at <a href=&quot;http://www.tricare.mil/&quot; title=&quot;TRICARE Web site&quot;>www.tricare.mil</a> or by contacting the appropriate regional TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor. </li>
