	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Genetic Test Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical laboratories generally report uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (<em>UGT</em>) <em>1A1</em> genotype assay results for the more frequent alleles, using either the star (*) allele nomenclature and/or the number of thymine-adenine (TA) repeats in the <em>UGT1A1</em> gene promoter region. Each named * allele is defined by one or more specific polymorphisms (see Supplemental Table S1 [see the &quot;Availability of the Companion documents&quot; field]). The level of UGT1A1 activity associated with the most frequent allelic variants is summarized in Supplemental Table S2. Genotyping rs8175347 for the number of TA repeats allows assignment to <em>UGT1A1*28</em> (TA<sub>7</sub>), <em>UGT1A1*36</em> (TA<sub>5</sub>), <em>UGT1A1*37</em> (TA<sub>8</sub>), or <em>UGT1A1*1</em> (TA<sub>6</sub>, reference genotype). Because rs887829 is in almost complete linkage with rs8175347 (r<sup>2</sup> &amp;cong; 0.99), metabolizer status may also be inferred based on rs887829. The table below summarizes the assignment of the likely UGT1A1 phenotype based on * allele and number of TA repeats.</p>
<p>Alleles of <em>UGT1A1</em> have been characterized in various geographically, racially, and ethnically diverse populations (see Supplemental Table S3). The <em>UGT1A1*6</em> allele (rs4148323, 211G&amp;gt;A) is associated with reduced UGT1A1 enzyme function and is found almost exclusively among individuals of Asian descent. In general, genotyping tests do not identify very rare or <em>de novo</em> variants.</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Homozygosity for <em>UGT1A1</em>*6, which occurs almost exclusively in individuals of Asian descent, is associated with Gilbert's syndrome. However, at this time it is unclear if patients with this diplotype are at increased risk of severe atazanavir-associated hyperbilirubinemia.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Therapeutic Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Atazanavir-associated indirect hyperbilirubinemia does not indicate hepatic injury, but some patients are not prescribed atazanavir to avoid the possibility of jaundice. Implications of <em>UGT1A1</em> genotype data for prescribing of atazanavir, boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat, may be influenced by several factors. These include consequences of jaundice for the particular patient (e.g., workers who frequently interact with the public), access to alternative protease inhibitor antiretrovirals (e.g., darunavir), and whether the provider finds it useful to monitor atazanavir-induced changes in bilirubin concentrations to assess adherence. Recommendations are provided in the table below.</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>UGT, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*All studies correlating <em>UGT1A1</em> genotypes with atazanavir adverse events have involved ritonavir boosting. However, concentration-time profiles are equivalent when boosted with either cobicistat or ritonavir, and bilirubin-related adverse events including discontinuation of atazanavir occur in a similar percentage of patients prescribed atazanavir with cobicistat or ritonavir. Associations between <em>UGT1A1</em> genotype, bilirubin elevations, and atazanavir/r discontinuation therefore almost certainly translate to atazanavir/cobicistat.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>&quot;Reference&quot; function refers to the <em>UGT1A1</em> allele to which other alleles are compared.</p>
<p>A <em>UGT1A1</em> genotype is most helpful if available before atazanavir is prescribed. If noticeable jaundice does not develop while taking atazanavir chronically (or develops but is not bothersome), then the risk for bilirubin-related atazanavir discontinuation is probably low regardless of <em>UGT1A1</em> genotype.</p>
<p>For individuals carrying two <em>UGT1A1</em> decreased function alleles (i.e., <em>UGT1A1*28/*28</em>, <em>UGT1A1*28/*37</em>, <em>UGT1A1*37/*37</em>, or rs887829 T/T), the likelihood of bilirubin-related atazanavir discontinuation is substantial. Before such individuals are prescribed atazanavir (boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat), all such patients should be advised about the substantial likelihood of developing jaundice. Prescribing atazanavir to such individuals should generally be avoided unless the patient does not consider jaundice to be a concern, or there are other compelling reasons to prescribe atazanavir.</p>
<p>For individuals carrying fewer than two <em>UGT1A1</em> decreased function alleles (i.e., <em>*1/*28, *1/*37, *36/*28, *36/*37,</em> rs887829 C/C or rs887829 C/T), the likelihood of bilirubin-related atazanavir discontinuation is low. This risk is extremely low for individuals carrying no <em>UGT1A1</em> decreased function alleles (i.e., <em>UGT1A1*1/*1, UGT1A1*1/*36, UGT1A1*36/*36</em>, or rs887829 C/C). Among patients with extensive metabolizer UGT1A1 phenotypes it may not be necessary to discuss the possibility of jaundice with atazanavir. This decision about whether to discuss possible jaundice should be based on the clinical situation and provider judgment. If advice is offered, such discussion may note that the likelihood of developing jaundice that would require discontinuation of atazanavir is very low.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Pediatrics</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the guideline's writing there are no pediatric data regarding associations between <em>UGT1A1</em> genotypes and likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir. However, <em>UGT1A1</em> genotypes are expected to affect atazanavir-related hyperbilirubinemia similarly in adults and children Therefore, recommendations for adults may be directly adapted to pediatric patients.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Incidental Findings</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who are homozygous for <em>UGT1A1*28</em> or <em>UGT1A1*6</em> are very likely to have Gilbert syndrome. Knowing an individual's <em>UGT1A1 </em>genotype prior to prescribing may have implications for selection and dosing for drugs known to be UGT1A1 substrates or inhibitors, such as irinotecan and nilotinib.</p>

    <li>In April 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents downgraded regimens containing atazanavir/ritonavir (r) from recommended to alternative status based on a large comparative trial showing the rate of toxicity-related discontinuation was greater with the atazanavir/r than with either darunavir/r or raltegravir, each given with tenofovir/emtricitabine. In 2015, the FDA approved a coformulated tablet comprising atazanavir with cobicistat, which was likewise relegated to alternative status. With once-daily atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, the frequency of grade 3 or higher bilirubin elevations (at least 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) is ~40%, and of grade 4 (at least 5 times the upper limit of normal) bilirubin elevation is ~4-8%. Among children and adolescents in a trial that involved atazanavir, 9% had a bilirubin value &amp;ge;5.1 times the upper limit of normal and 1.4% experienced jaundice. </li>
    <li>There is little apparent risk of <em>UGT1A1</em> genotyping that results in a recommendation to avoid atazanavir, as alternative protease inhibitor-containing regimens are comparable in terms of efficacy and pill burden, although costs may vary depending on the payer. </li>
    <li>Other possible limitations of <em>UGT1A1</em> genotyping include laboratory error and an incomplete <em>UGT1A1</em> genetic profile, as many tests only report results for <em>UGT1A1*28</em>. As individuals' genotypes do not change over time, genotyping errors could remain in the medical record for the lifetime of the patient. </li>

<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written, and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision-making, as well as to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health care provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be solely made by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property related to any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</span></strong></p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature concluded that homozygosity of <em>UGT1A1*28</em> is a risk factor for occurrence of severe atazanavir-associated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with a pooled positive predictive value of 40.3% and a pooled negative predictive value of 88.1%. Bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir through 96 weeks is strongly associated with rs887829 T/T (in significant linkage disequilibrium [LD] with <em>UGT1A1*28</em>), with reported positive predictive value ranging from 20% to 60% depending on race/ethnicity. Thus, race/ethnicity may modify the genetic effect (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). Nongenetic factors such as fasting and diet can also affect bilirubin concentrations.</p>
<p>This CPIC guideline assumes that the <em>UGT1A1</em> genotype results are already available to the prescriber. It is beyond the scope of this guideline to make recommendations regarding whether or not <em>UGT1A1</em> genotyping should be performed.</p></div>"/>
