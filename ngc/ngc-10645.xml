	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to grade levels of evidence. Some emphasize the quality of randomized clinical trials. However, because so few randomized clinical trials have studied pediatric concussion, a broader system was used to rank evidence that also emphasizes the strength of systematic reviews or large studies that may not involve interventions.

</ul>
<p>Inclusion criteria were concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), systematic reviews, guidelines or primary research on concussion/mTBI. Exclusion criteria were adult-only populations, conference abstracts and papers either not peer-reviewed or that focused on prevention, and patients in whom the computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed structural changes or bleeding.</p>
<p>The panel collaborated with the co-chairs from the 2013 update of the &quot;Guidelines for Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Persistent Symptoms Second Edition For Adults (18+ years of age)&quot; to identify articles that addressed the pediatric population to help streamline efforts and reduce duplication.</p>
<p>A PhD librarian/information specialist generated the search string, and had it reviewed using Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS). See Appendix 1: Search Strategy for Systematic Review in the complementary <em>References and Levels of Evidence</em> document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The search string did not impose any limits on language or study design. Once accepted, it was used to search the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and TRIPDatabase. The literature search resulted in over 3,000 unique articles and 13 domains of interest (see table in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Two reviewers independently screened each identified citation as &quot;definitely,&quot; &quot;possibly,&quot; or &quot;clearly not&quot; meeting inclusion criteria using a standard screening tool. A research assistant/medical student performed duplicate review on a sample of 132 abstracts to evaluate the inter-rater agreement of the article's eligibility. In the event of disagreement or uncertainty, the project leader consulted the full text and resolved differences. Following this exercise, the inclusion criteria were modified to exclude books and dissertations, which pared the list of articles down to about 400. After a further review of the full text of each, the list was narrowed to 242 articles.</p></div>"/>

<p>There are many ways to grade levels of evidence. Some emphasize the quality of randomized clinical trials.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Guideline Panel</strong></p>
<p>The project leader engaged a team of experts from Canada and the USA to represent the full spectrum of pediatric health disciplines and expertise in concussion on a national and international scale. As well, to ensure that the document represents the perspectives of as many groups of stakeholders as possible, the panel included the chair of the 2012 Zurich Concussion in Sport Conference, the co-founder and director of the Brain Injury Centre (Harvard University), the chair of the American Academy of Neurology Concussion Guidelines, the developer of commonly used post-concussion tools (example: Acute Concussion Evaluation [ACE], Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory [PCSI]), community- and school-based experts and organizational stakeholders, and the funder, the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF). The choice of members reflected the focus on clinical assessment and management rather than prevention.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Model</strong></p>
<p>The project leader used the Practice Guidelines Evaluation and Adaptation Cycle (see diagram in the original guideline document) as the model for developing the guidelines. The need and rationale for guidelines on pediatric concussion had already been established.</p>
<p><strong>Glaser Method of Reaching Consensus</strong></p>
<p>Like the Delphi and nominal group approach, Dr. Edward Glaser and the National Institutes of Health developed a method of reaching consensus in which various levels of participation interact with the main level (a core group that includes the project leader and that chooses its own members internally). The project document is revised internally until considered suitable, and critiqued by health care professionals who have been engaged for their expertise and prominence. Those comments are included in a redraft until the core group is satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>Among the characteristics of the Glaser method are the degree of support behind the project following a statement by experts of a demonstrated need, the number of organizations and people invited to comment at every stage, and the involvement of a leader who would be called a &quot;knowledge broker&quot; in today's language.</p>
<p>The project team chose the Glaser method of reaching consensus as the most suitable for its situation, given the attributed voting and commenting tools and the group-based discussions at the consensus meeting (see below). Where there was uncertainty at any stage, the project leader sent the text in question to the designated experts for further review.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Meeting</strong></p>
<p>The project team, including stakeholders, attended the consensus meeting held on November 19, 2013 in Ottawa, Ontario. Participants worked in groups according to their expertise to draft the initial recommendations based on existing guidelines and generate new ones based on their review of the papers, the level of evidence assigned or their clinical expertise if they found no evidence (General Directions for Clinical Use). This was done using the ADAPTE process (a systematic approach for the adaptation of guidelines that was used to develop and update the &quot;Guidelines for Concussion/ Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Persistent Symptoms Second Edition For Adults (18+ years of age).&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Since most concussions resolve within one month, the panel decided that a document based on timelines would be more helpful for clinicians (the primary users of the guidelines) than one based on themes. The initial recommendations in the 15 domains were reorganized as follows:</p>
<p>In advance and On injury address issues such as adopting policies on concussion and recognizing symptoms in schools and/or sports organizations, and were designed primarily for schools and parents and/or caregivers. On presentation covers acute care, such as initial diagnosis and management. On discharge focuses on the verbal and written information needed to reassure and educate parents and/or caregivers on the course of recovery. On interim assessment evaluates child/adolescent's early recovery, and introduces return-to-learn/play processes. Finally, On re-assessment reinforces cognitive and physical rest, if required, and provides guidance on managing persistent symptoms.</p>
<p>The initial recommendations were also converted from statements into bulleted action items, incorporating the tools recommended for use and a short sentence to explain the necessity of the action immediately below. The project team felt that clinicians, schools and/or community sports organizations/centres, and parents and/or caregivers alike would find this format easy to follow. This design is also suitable for converting the recommendations into an interactive web tool or mobile app, should funding materialize. The recommendations were created using the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch &amp;amp; Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) tool as a foundation for content.</p>
<p>Panel members took into consideration the potential benefits, side effects and risks when drafting the recommendations. Particularly unique to pediatrics, for example, is the limited approval of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pediatric use by regulatory organizations such as Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as demonstrated in Tool 5.6: Approved Medications for Pediatric Indications (see the original guideline document).</p></div>"/>

    <li>The strength of the current body of evidence is the exponential growth of articles published on pediatric concussion since 2000. Notably, the literature has clarified the need for pediatric computed tomographic (CT) imaging in the emergency setting through several well designed prospective multi-centre studies, the results of which will reduce the incidence of unnecessary radiation in children/adolescents. </li>
    <li>However, the body of evidence has several limitations. The field of pediatric concussion is still in its infancy compared to that of general traumatic brain injury (moderate and severe). As stated above, very few randomized clinical trials have examined the results of possible therapies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological. In particular, the ideal duration of physical and cognitive rest remains unknown. </li>
    <li>As well, very few studies have examined pediatric concussion beyond the context of sports injury or examined the long-term outcomes of children/adolescents who have sustained multiple concussions and the possible link to severe cognitive outcomes. Lastly, these guidelines relate to children aged 5 to 18 only. The guideline panel was unable to include recommendations for preschoolers (aged 0 to 5) due to a lack of literature and validated assessment tools for that age group. </li>
    <li>This document is intended to guide health care professionals in diagnosing and managing pediatric&amp;mdash;not adult&amp;mdash;concussion. It is not for self-diagnosis or treatment. Parents and/or caregivers may bring it to the attention of their child/adolescent's health care professionals. </li>
    <li>The best knowledge available at the time of publication has informed the recommendations in this document. However, health care professionals should also use their own judgment, the preferences of their patients, and factors such as the availability of resources in their decisions. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Editorial Independence</strong></p>
<p>The project leader maintained full authority over the editorial content of these guidelines, under advice from members of the project team. Editorial decisions were made in teams of members with diverse backgrounds and expertise, and based on the relevance of the works reviewed to the subject matter, not on the views or interests of the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (the funder).</p>
<p>Because of her specific knowledge of knowledge transfer and concussion, and to represent the Foundation as an end-user of the guidelines, one employee of the Foundation had a monitoring role on the project team and moderated a discussion on KT in that context. She was not in a position to influence decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Competing Interests</strong></p>
<p>Members of the guideline panel and the external reviewers were asked for details about potential conflicts of interest. They made the following statements:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Gerard Gioia: I am the author of several clinical measures, such as the Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE), for which I do not receive monetary benefit. I am also a creator/author on measures for which I do receive royalty payments, including the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Tasks of Executive Control (TEC). </li>
    <li>Chris Giza: I receive the following funding: NCAA Concussion Task Force (travel expenses) and research grant; California State Athletic Commission (travel expenses only); Joseph Drown Foundation (research grant), NIH (research grants). Relatives have no conflicts. </li>
    <li>Corinne Kagan: I represent the sponsor of the Guideline (Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation). I will make every effort not to interfere with the editorial independence of the guideline developers. As a member of the consensus group, I will add comments only as pertain to implementation and clarity, knowledge translation and use, system of care and policy issues of the materials. </li>
    <li>Anna McCormick: I occasionally bill privately to complete forms or reports for insurance purposes. </li>
    <li>William Meehan: I receive funding from the NFL Players' Association and royalties from Prager Publishing for the book, Kids, Sports, and Concussion: A guide for coaches and parents; and Wolters Kluwer for working as an author on UpToDate. </li>
</ul>
<p>The project leader evaluated the statements and decided that these people did not face a conflict of interest in terms of creating or reviewing this document.</p></div>"/>
