	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I&amp;ndash;V</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A&amp;ndash;F</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: These recommendations and clinical practice guidelines are based on the scientific literature published prior to January 2013.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Risk Factors</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess the presence of limited ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, high body mass index in nonathletic individuals, running, and work-related weight-bearing activities&amp;mdash;particularly under conditions with poor shock absorption&amp;mdash;as risk factors for the development of heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis/Classification</span></strong></p>
<p>Physical therapists should diagnose the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) category of plantar fasciitis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of heel pain (<strong>b28015 Pain in lower limb</strong>, <strong>b2804 Radiating pain in a segment or region</strong>) using the following history and physical examination findings:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Plantar medial heel pain: most noticeable with initial steps after a period of inactivity but also worse following prolonged weight bearing </li>
    <li>Heel pain precipitated by a recent increase in weight-bearing activity </li>
    <li>Pain with palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia </li>
    <li>Positive windlass test </li>
    <li>Negative tarsal tunnel tests </li>
    <li>Limited active and passive talocrural joint dorsiflexion range of motion </li>
    <li>Abnormal Foot Posture Index score </li>
    <li>High body mass index in nonathletic individuals </li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Differential Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess for diagnostic classifications other than heel pain/plantar fasciitis, including spondyloarthritis, fat-pad atrophy, and proximal plantar fibroma, when the individual&amp;rsquo;s reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of the original guideline document, or when the individual's symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at normalization of the individual's impairments of body function. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Examination</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ), or the Foot Function Index (FFI) and may use the computer-adaptive version of the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) as validated self-report questionnaires before and after interventions intended to alleviate the physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity Limitation and Participation Restriction Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should utilize easily reproducible performance-based measures of activity limitation and participation restriction measures to assess changes in the patient's level of function associated with heel pain/plantar fasciitis over the episode of care. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Physical Impairment Measures</strong></p>
<p>When evaluating a patient with heel pain/plantar fasciitis over an episode of care, assessment of impairment of body function should include measures of pain with initial steps after a period of inactivity and pain with palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia, and may include measures of active and passive ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and body mass index in nonathletic individuals. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Manual Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use manual therapy, consisting of joint and soft tissue mobilization, procedures to treat relevant lower extremity joint mobility and calf flexibility deficits and to decrease pain and improve function in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Stretching</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use plantar fascia&amp;ndash;specific and gastrocnemius/soleus stretching to provide short-term (1 week to 4 months) pain relief for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Heel pads may be used to increase the benefits of stretching. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Taping</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use antipronation taping for immediate (up to 3 weeks) pain reduction and improved function for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Additionally, clinicians may use elastic therapeutic tape applied to the gastrocnemius and plantar fascia for short-term (1 week) pain reduction. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Foot Orthoses</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use foot orthoses, either prefabricated or custom fabricated/fitted, to support the medial longitudinal arch and cushion the heel in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis to reduce pain and improve function for short- (2 weeks) to long-term (1 year) periods, especially in those individuals who respond positively to antipronation taping techniques. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Night Splints</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should prescribe a 1- to 3-month program of night splints for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis who consistently have pain with the first step in the morning. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Physical Agents</strong></p>
<p><em>Electrotherapy</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should use manual therapy, stretching, and foot orthoses instead of electrotherapeutic modalities, to promote intermediate and long-term (1-6 months) improvements in clinical outcomes for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Clinicians may or may not use iontophoresis with dexamethasone or acetic acid to provide short-term (2-4 weeks) pain relief and improved function. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Low-Level Laser</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may use low-level laser therapy to reduce pain and activity limitations in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Phonophoresis</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may use phonophoresis with ketoprofen gel to reduce pain in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Ultrasound</em></p>
<p>The use of ultrasound cannot be recommended for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Footwear</strong></p>
<p>To reduce pain in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis, clinicians may prescribe (1) a rocker-bottom shoe construction in conjunction with a foot orthosis, and (2) shoe rotation during the work week for those who stand for long periods. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Education and Counseling for Weight Loss</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may provide education and counseling on exercise strategies to gain or maintain optimal lean body mass in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Clinicians may also refer individuals to an appropriate health care practitioner to address nutrition issues. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: E</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Exercise and Neuromuscular Re-education</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may prescribe strengthening exercises and movement training for muscles that control pronation and attenuate forces during weight-bearing activities. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Dry Needling</strong></p>
<p>The use of trigger point dry needling cannot be recommended for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The authors of this guideline revision worked with research librarians with expertise in systematic review to perform a systematic search for concepts associated with heel pain or plantar fasciitis in articles published since 2007 related to classification, examination, and intervention strategies for heel pain or plantar fasciitis, consistent with previous guideline development methods related to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) classification. Briefly, the following databases were searched from 2007 to between December 13 and 19, 2012: MEDLINE (PubMed) (2007 to date), Cochrane Library (2007 to date), Web of Science (2007 to date), CINAHL (2007 to date), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (2007 to date), PEDro (2007 to date), and ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source (2007 to date). See Appendix A and Appendix B in the original guideline document for full search strategies and search dates and results, respectively.</p>
<p>Articles contributing to recommendations were reviewed based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Appendix C in the original guideline document), with the goal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist clinical decision making for adult persons with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. The title and abstract of each article were reviewed independently by 2 members of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) development team for inclusion. Full-text review was then similarly conducted to obtain the final set of articles for contribution to recommendations. The team leader provided the final decision for discrepancies that were not resolved by the review team. See Appendix D for a flow chart of articles and Appendix E for articles included in recommendations by topic (see the original guideline document for appendices). For selected relevant topics that were not appropriate for the development of recommendations, such as shockwave therapy, injection, and imaging, articles were not subject to the systematic review process and were not included in the flow chart.</p></div>"/>
