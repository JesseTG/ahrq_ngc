	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) Best Practice Guideline Development Team searched an established list of websites for guidelines and other relevant content published between January 2011 and August 2016. The resulting list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites and recommendations from the literature. RNAO expert panel members also were asked to suggest additional guidelines (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document). Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and the inclusion criteria used, is available in the search strategy document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant research studies only published in English between January 2011 and April 2017 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Expert panel members were asked to review their personal libraries for key studies not found through the above search strategies (see Figures 4, 5, and 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Detailed information on the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria and search terms, is available in the search strategy document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). </p>
<p>Studies were independently assessed for relevance and eligibility by the Guideline Development Lead and a nursing research associate based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through tiebreaking by a second nursing research associate.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Guideline Development Lead and a nursing research associate appraised seven international guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II (AGREE II). Guidelines with an overall score of four or below were considered low and were excluded. Guidelines with a score of five were considered moderate, and guidelines with a score of six or seven were considered high. </p>

<p>Quality appraisal scores for 25 studies (a random sample of 20 percent of the total studies eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by the Guideline Development Lead and a nursing research associate. Quality appraisal was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) for primary studies, Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) for systematic reviews, and the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO's) scoring system that rates studies as low, moderate, or high (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>An acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, K=0.86) was reached, which justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction for the remaining studies. The remaining studies were divided equally for quality appraisal and data extraction. Research summaries of literature findings were completed and used to describe the results in narrative form. The comprehensive data tables and research summaries were provided to all expert panel members for review and discussion.</p>

<p>For this guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence&amp;mdash;based on the purpose and scope of this guideline, and supported by the three research questions listed below&amp;mdash;was conducted to capture relevant peer-reviewed literature published between January 2011 and April 2017. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review: </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>How do health workers provide trauma-informed and culturally safe harm reduction care to people who are injecting drugs or accessing services in supervised injection services (SIS) facilities? </li>
    <li>What are effective educational strategies to increase the knowledge, attitudes, and skill that health workers need to work with people who inject drugs or access services in SIS facilities? </li>
    <li>What organizational and health system policies are required to support health workers in providing high-quality care in SIS facilities? </li>
</ol>
<p>The RNAO Best Practice Guideline Development Team and expert panel work to integrate the most current and best evidence, and to ensure the validity, appropriateness, and safety of the guideline recommendations with supporting evidence and expert panel consensus. </p>
<p>A modified Delphi technique was employed to obtain expert panel consensus on the recommendations in this Guideline.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>As a component of the guideline development process, feedback was obtained from participants across a wide range of health-care organizations, practice areas, and sectors. Participants include nurses, health workers, people with lived experience, knowledgeable administrators and funders of health-care services. Stakeholders representing diverse perspectives also were solicited for their feedback. </p>
<p>Stakeholder reviewers for the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) best practice guidelines (BPGs) are identified in two ways. First, stakeholders are recruited through a public call issued on the <a href=&quot;http://RNAO.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>RNAO Web site</a>. Second, individuals and organizations with expertise in the guideline topic area are identified by the RNAO guideline development team and the expert panel, and are directly invited to participate in the review.</p>
<p>Stakeholder reviewers are individuals with subject matter expertise in the guideline topic or those who may be affected by the implementation of the guideline. Reviewers may be nurses, health workers, administrators, researchers, educators, nursing students, or persons and family. RNAO aims to solicit stakeholder expertise and perspectives representing diverse health-care sectors, roles within nursing and other professions (e.g., clinical practice, research, education, or policy), and geographic locations.</p>
<p>Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and to participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholder feedback is submitted online by completing a survey questionnaire. The stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is this recommendation clear? </li>
    <li>Do you agree with this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Is the discussion of evidence thorough and does the evidence support the recommendation? </li>
</ul>
<p>Public Advisors are reviewers who have lived experience. They participate in focus groups and interviews facilitated by RNAO expert panel members to provide feedback on the guideline. Public Advisors are asked the following questions about each recommendation:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Do you agree with this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Will this recommendation meet your needs? </li>
</ul>
<p>All reviewers have the opportunity to include comments and feedback for each section of the guideline. Reviewer submissions are compiled and feedback is summarized by the RNAO Best Practice Guideline Development Team. Together with the expert panel, RNAO reviews and considers all feedback and, if necessary, modifies the guideline content and recommendations prior to publication to address the feedback received. </p>
<p>Stakeholder reviewers have given consent to the publication of their names and relevant information in this Guideline. Public Advisors review and sign a consent form prior to participating in focus groups or interviews, indicating whether they want to be acknowledged as an individual or group (such as a patient advisory council) or if they wish to remain anonymous.</p></div>"/>

    <li>People who inject drugs are at risk for stigmatization, disrespect and judgments during training sessions when engaging with learners that may be inexperienced at applying the principles of harm reduction, cultural safety, and trauma-informed practices. The unique needs of priority populations (such as Indigenous people) need to be considered in the context of including them in educational programs in order to prevent any potential harm associated with interacting with learners. </li>
    <li>Peer workers are at risk for harm (e.g., psychological distress) if requisite supports are not provided to manage any issues associated with their involvement in supervised injection services (SIS). </li>
    <li>There is a risk of harm to priority populations of people who inject drugs if the services offered are not relevant or effective for their specific health and social requirements (see Appendix F in the original guideline document). For example, services offered to Indigenous peoples should be provided by an individual or organization that understands the needs of this population. </li>
    <li>There is potential harm for people who inject drugs if there has not been a considerable assessment of the diverse needs of people who inject drugs in the region (such as rural Indigenous people) and the resources available in a region (including access to nurses with specialized knowledge and skills), or if there had not been careful planning around the implementation of a new SIS or the expansion of an existing one. </li>
    <li>There is a potential for harm if the unique needs of youth are not considered in the programming of services and supports. It also is important to recognize and consider the complex ethical issues that nurses and health workers may face when they are expected to participate in assisted injection; doing so will help to mitigate those issues prior to implementing a new policy. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implementation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging. It takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines for practice to change: guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way to ensure that recommendations fit the local context. The 2012 Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO's) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> provides an evidence-informed process for doing this. It can be downloaded at the <a href=&quot;http://rnao.ca/bpg/resources/toolkit-implementation-best-practice-guidelines-second-edition&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>RNAO Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practices in health care is more likely when the following occur: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the &quot;Knowledge-to-Action&quot; framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of its best practice guidelines (BPGs). RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including the following:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&amp;reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs. </li>
    <li>Nursing order sets, which provide clear, concise, and actionable intervention statements derived from the practice recommendations of clinical BPGs that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but which may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments. </li>
    <li>The Best Practice Spotlight Organization&amp;reg; (BPSO&amp;reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, RNAO offers annual capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation. Information about our implementation strategies can be found at:</p>
