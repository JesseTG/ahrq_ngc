	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Comprehensive Adult Eye and Vision Examination</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Examination Procedures*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: A comprehensive adult eye and vision examination should include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patient, family, and social history, including visual, ocular and general health, medication usage, and vocational and avocational visual requirements </li>
    <li>Measurement of visual acuity </li>
    <li>Preliminary examination regarding aspects of visual function and ocular health </li>
    <li>Determination of refractive status </li>
    <li>Assessment of ocular motility, binocular vision, and accommodation, as appropriate, based on patient's age, visual signs and symptoms, and visual requirements </li>
    <li>Ocular health assessment, including evaluation of the anterior and posterior segment, peripheral retina, measurement of intraocular pressure, and visual field testing </li>
    <li>Systemic health assessment, as indicated. </li>
</ul>
<p>(See Appendix Table 1 in the original guideline document.)</p>
<p>See the &quot;Potential Benefits&quot; field for a listing of potential benefits and harms of testing.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of all of the tests and/or assessments included in this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in the enhanced ability to effectively diagnose any eye or vision problem in adults. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*<strong>Note</strong>: Specific tests and procedures listed are provided as examples only and are not a complete listing of testing options. Clinicians should remain alert for new and emerging technologies, instruments and procedures, and incorporate them into the clinical examination, as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: Any systemic medication or supplement used by patients should be investigated by their eye doctor for ocular risk factors or side effects.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to assist eye doctors in determining the potential risks or side effects any medication or supplement may have on a patient's eye health or vision. The benefits of this recommendation were established by an expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: Pharmacologic dilation of the pupil is generally required for thorough stereoscopic evaluation of the ocular media, retinal vasculature, macula, optic nerve, and the peripheral retina.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation would enhance the ability to diagnose ocular disease. Potential harms involve adverse reactions to drugs used for dilation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Action Statement</strong>: Because of possible variations in measurements obtained when using various intraocular pressure (IOP) testing instruments/techniques, eye doctors should consider taking more than one reading with the same instrument to reduce measurement error (Carbonaro et al., 2010).</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: <strong>Grade C</strong>, Observational Study. No randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews were identified regarding the variability of IOP measurements. </li>
    <li><strong>Clinical Recommendation Level</strong>: <strong>Recommendation</strong>. Eye doctors should generally follow this recommendation, but should remain alert for new information. </li>
    <li><strong>Evidence Statement</strong>: There can be significant differences in the measurements obtained using different IOP testing methods. The clinician needs to be aware of these differences when using any particular instrument or technique. <strong>Evidence Quality: Grade C</strong>. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Benefits</strong>: Preventing and/or minimizing vision loss through early diagnosis, treatment, and management of ocular health conditions. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Risks/Harms</strong>: Allergic responses to diagnostic pharmaceutical agents or other adverse effects. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Benefits significantly outweigh harms. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Costs</strong>: Direct cost of testing as a component of a comprehensive eye and vision examination. </li>
    <li><strong>Value Judgments</strong>: Repeat measurement of IOP using the same instrument/technique can reduce the chances of measurement error and help ensure appropriate patient diagnosis and management. </li>
    <li><strong>Role of Patient Preferences</strong>: Small. </li>
    <li><strong>Intentional Vagueness</strong>: Specific type of IOP instruments/techniques are not specified as they are considered practice of medicine decisions. </li>
    <li><strong>Gaps in Evidence</strong>:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of IOP tests/instruments currently used to diagnose glaucoma in adult patients. </li>
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of new or emerging technologies/instrumentation in the diagnosis of glaucoma. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Action Statement</strong>: Eye doctors should not rely on a single, normal confrontation visual field test result as proof that a field loss is not present and should conduct threshold visual field testing on patients if there is a clinical suspicion of a visual field defect. (Kerr et al., 2010; Shahinfar, Johnson, &amp;amp; Madsen, 1995)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: <strong>Grade B</strong>, Cohort study and <strong>Grade C</strong>, Diagnostic study. No randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews were identified regarding the sensitivity of confrontation visual field testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Clinical Recommendation Level</strong>: <strong>Recommendation</strong>. Eye doctors should generally follow this recommendation, but should remain alert for new information. </li>
    <li><strong>Evidence Statements</strong>:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The diagnostic accuracy of confrontation visual field testing is low for mild to moderate visual field defects and when performed as a standalone test. The sensitivity of confrontation testing can be improved by using two testing procedures (e.g., kinetic testing with a 5 mm red target along with static finger wiggle testing). Formal perimetry should be conducted if there is a suspicion of a visual field defect. <strong>Evidence Quality: Grade B</strong>. </li>
        <li>When only an individual test is performed, confrontation visual field testing is sensitive for only very dense visual field defects. However, there is high positive predictive value when a confrontation visual field loss is demonstrated. Therefore confrontation visual field testing is not without value. Clinicians should not rely on a negative confrontation result as proof that a field loss is not present. <strong>Evidence Quality: Grade C</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Benefits</strong>: Decreased likelihood that a visual field defect will be missed. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Risks/Harms</strong>: No adverse effects of testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Benefits significantly outweigh harms. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Costs</strong>: Direct cost of testing as a component of a comprehensive eye and vision examination </li>
    <li><strong>Value Judgments</strong>: The sensitivity of confrontation visual field testing can vary depending on the type and location of field loss and the method used to perform the testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Role of Patient Preferences</strong>: Small. </li>
    <li><strong>Intentional Vagueness</strong>: Specific types of confrontation visual field testing are not stated, as they are considered practice of medicine decisions. </li>
    <li><strong>Gaps in Evidence</strong>:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of confrontation visual field testing in adult patients. </li>
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of new or emerging technologies in visual field testing. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Counseling and Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: At the conclusion of an eye and vision examination, the eye doctor should explain the diagnosis to the patient, relate it to the patient's symptoms, and discuss a treatment plan and prognosis.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementing this recommendation is likely to increase patient understanding of any diagnosed eye or vision problems and improve compliance with any recommended treatment. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: Persons who will undergo or have undergone ocular surgery or other specialty care should be counseled by their eye doctor regarding their ongoing need for periodic comprehensive eye and vision examinations.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementing this recommendation is likely to increase patient understanding of the need for ongoing primary eye and vision care services after eye surgery or other specialized care. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Action Statement</strong>: Eye doctors should ask about and document their patients' smoking status and inform them about the benefits to their eyes, vision, and overall health, through smoking cessation (Christen at al., 2000; Klein et al., 2014).</p>
