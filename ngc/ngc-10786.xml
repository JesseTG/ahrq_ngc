	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The evidence search and review included electronic database searches in <em>The Cochrane Library</em>, Medline via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCO. The search strategy is shown in the Appendix in the original guideline document. Related article searches were conducted in PubMed. The bibliographies of articles identified by database searches were also reviewed by 1 of 4 members of the committee, and references identified in this manner were added to the review. Articles included in the 2003 evidence report on bronchiolitis in preparation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 guideline also were reviewed. In addition, the committee reviewed articles published after completion of the systematic review for these updated guidelines. The current literature review encompasses the period from 2004 through May 2014.</p>
<p>Other criteria helped define the setting, age, language, and date of publication. Both outpatient (clinicians' offices, outpatient clinics, emergency departments) and inpatient (hospitals) were included. Studies were limited to pediatrics. Searches were also limited to English language, although studies in other languages were reviewed when included in relevant systematic reviews. Date parameters were not restricted; however, newer studies were focused for antimicrobial therapy and cost effectiveness studies. In addition to the electronic searches, articles were received from subcommittee members, and reference lists were also searched. The same criteria were applied to these articles as to those in the initial search.</p>
<p>Study design criteria for full text review varied by section of the technical report. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were reviewed for original studies not found in the initial electronic searches. For diagnostic studies, controlled clinical trials and observational studies (both prospective and large retrospective) studies were reviewed. For therapy studies, randomized controlled trials were reviewed as well as large prospective and retrospective observational studies. For prevention and long term effect studies, prospective observational and other epidemiologic studies were reviewed.</p></div>"/>

Evidence quality appraisal for the body of evidence related to recommendation statements followed the AAP's levels for aggregate evidence quality, allowing for integration of evidence into the recommendation development process by committee members.

<p>In June 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a new subcommittee to review and revise the 2006 bronchiolitis guideline. The subcommittee included primary care physicians, including general pediatricians, a family physician, and pediatric subspecialists, including hospitalists, pulmonologists, emergency physicians, a neonatologist, and pediatric infectious disease physicians. The subcommittee also included an epidemiologist trained in systematic reviews, a guideline methodologist/informatician, and a parent representative.</p>
<p>The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence in support of a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and recommendations be defined. Evidence-based recommendations reflect the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the recommendation is followed. The AAP policy statement &quot;Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice&quot; was followed in designating levels of recommendation (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p></div>"/>
