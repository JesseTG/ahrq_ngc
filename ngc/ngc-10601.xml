	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance to perioperative personnel for managing autologous tissue in the perioperative setting, including avulsed teeth, cranial bone flaps, parathyroid glands, skin, veins, and dropped autografts. Guidelines are provided for transferring tissue from the sterile field, packaging and labeling, transporting and storing, and handling autologous tissue for delayed replantation or autotransplantation within the same facility. Guidelines for managing autologous adipose tissue are not provided. Currently, adipose aspirates can only be used for immediate autologous fat grafting at the time of recovery, and there is no reliable method for preserving and storing adipose tissue for delayed autotransplantation. Recommendations related to processes for intraoperative storage and cryopreservation of autologous tissue are outside the scope of the original guideline document.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot;>
    <li>Avulsed teeth that cannot be immediately replanted in the patient at the time of avulsion should be placed in a storage medium to help maintain periodontal ligament (PDL) cell viability. </li>
    <li>The patient's autologous cranial bone flap may be preserved and replanted. </li>
    <li>The patient's parathyroid tissue may be cryopreserved and autotransplanted. </li>
    <li>The patient's autologous skin may be preserved and autotransplanted. </li>
    <li>The patient's autologous vein may be preserved and autotransplanted. </li>
    <li>A multidisciplinary team consisting of the surgeon, perioperative registered nurse (RN), and infection preventionist should conduct a risk assessment to consider the benefits and potential harms associated with replantation or autotransplantation of a contaminated autograft compared with other treatment options (e.g., discarding the graft and using artificial material). </li>
    <li>Autologous tissue that will be stored within the facility or health care organization for delayed replantation or autotransplantation should be transferred from the sterile field in a manner that maintains the sterility and integrity of the tissue and prevents exposure of health care personnel to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials. </li>
    <li>Autologous tissue that will be stored within the facility or health care organization for delayed replantation or autotransplantation should be packaged and labeled in a manner that protects and secures the autograft; prevents cross-contamination and mix-ups during storage; facilitates tissue tracking; and prevents exposure of health care personnel to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials. </li>
    <li>Autologous tissue should be transported in a manner that protects and secures the autograft; maintains the integrity of the tissue; prevents exposure of health care personnel to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials; and ensures the confidentiality of protected patient information. </li>
    <li>Autologous tissue intended for delayed replantation or autotransplantation should be stored in a manner that protects and secures the autograft, prevents cross-contamination and mix-ups during storage, and prevents exposure of health care personnel to blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials. </li>
    <li>Autologous tissue intended for replantation or autotransplantation should be handled using sterile technique and in a manner that protects and secures the autograft from damage or contamination. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for the managing autologous tissue must be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1271, 2013; &quot;Current good tissue practice,&quot; 2012; &quot;Standards for tissue banking,&quot; 2012; &quot;Transplant safety. In: The Joint Commission. Comprehensive accreditation manual for hospitals,&quot; 2014; &quot;Transplant safety. In: The Joint Commission. Comprehensive accreditation manual for ambulatory care,&quot; 2014; &quot;Surgical and related services,&quot; 2014). </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should receive initial and ongoing education and complete competency verification activities on the principles and processes of autologous tissue management. </li>
    <li>Nursing activities related to autologous tissue management should be documented in a manner consistent with facility or health care organization policies and procedures, regulatory requirements, (21 CFR 1271, 2013; &quot;Current good tissue practice,&quot; 2012) AORN guidelines (&quot;Guideline for perioperative health care information management,&quot; 2015), and accreditation agency (&quot;Transplant safety.

Comprehensive accreditation manual for ambulatory care,&quot; 2014; &quot;Surgical and related services,&quot; 2014) and American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) standards (&quot;Standards for tissue banking,&quot; 2012). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in a variety of quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the facility or health care organization plan to improve understanding of and compliance with the principles and processes of autologous tissue management. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>On January 24 and January 27, 2014, a medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE&amp;reg;, CINAHL&amp;reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and non-randomized trials and studies, case reports, letters, reviews, and guidelines. The librarian also searched Scopus&amp;reg;, although not systematically. Search terms included <em>autologous transplantation, tissue preservation, organ transplantation, preservation, storage, storage solution, saline solution, isotonic saline, potassium chloride, N-acetylhistidine, ice, cold temperature, bone flap, bone transplantation, skull, bone and bones, surgical flap, saphenous vein, radial artery, renal artery, mammary artery</em>, and <em>thoracic artery</em>. During the development of this document, the lead author also requested supplementary searches on the topics of storage media, preservation of avulsed teeth, and the use of swab cultures.</p>
<p>The initial search was limited to literature published in English since January 2006; however, the time restriction was not considered in subsequent searches. At the time of the initial search, the librarian also established weekly alerts on the topics included in the initial search. The librarian later added terms from subsequent supplementary searches to the alerts and, until May 2014, presented relevant results to the lead author.</p>
<p>The lead author reviewed search results from the medical librarian&amp;rsquo;s literature search for the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Guideline for Specimen Management to identify literature specific to management of other tissues and the preservation of avulsed teeth. During the development of the document, the lead author requested additional articles and other literature that either did not fit the original search criteria or was discovered during the evidence appraisal process. Finally, the lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed or retracted publications; evidence specific to organ transplantations, processes for cryopreservation, and surgical techniques and treatment protocols; and some evidence related to allografts, intraoperative storage of autologous tissue, and educational needs surrounding traumatic dental injuries not specific to health care workers.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The harms associated with immediate replantation of an avulsed tooth are that the tooth replantation may be performed incorrectly. Replantation of a tooth that is contaminated with debris may increase the patient's risk for infection. </li>
    <li>The harms associated with the use of autologous bone for reconstructive cranioplasty include the potential for infection from contaminated cranial bone grafts, and bone nonviability and resorption, particularly in pediatric patients. </li>
    <li>The harms associated with frozen or cryopreserved storage of autologous cranial bone flaps are that the autograft may be contaminated during storage or during the recovery or replantation procedure. The process of cryopreservation and long-term storage may lead to mechanical instability (e.g., crack formation) of the bone or surface abrasiveness that facilitates bacterial adhesion and colonization. Long-term storage of autologous tissue carries with it the potential for mix-ups if autograft labeling methods are inadequate (e.g., smudging of identifiers during cold storage, labels separating from the package), and contamination or cross-contamination if the graft's packaging material is not validated for use at the storage temperature selected. </li>
    <li>The harms associated with cryopreservation and autotransplantation of patients' parathyroid tissue include the need for a secondary surgery, increased cost, and the increased potential for infection from transplanting contaminated or nonviable autologous parathyroid tissue. There is an increased risk of autograft failure with cryopreserved tissue compared with fresh tissue. Parathyroid tissue may be destroyed by the cryopreservation process or degraded to the extent that insufficient parathyroid hormone is released after autotransplantation. </li>
    <li>The harms associated with subcutaneous storage of autologous cranial bone flaps are that the procedure requires additional surgical time and may require an additional surgical incision, and the graft may be contaminated during recovery, during storage, or during the replantation procedure. Patients may experience discomfort from the stored autograft, and osteoclast activity may cause the autograft to diminish in size during subcutaneous storage. </li>
    <li>The harms associated with storing autologous skin for delayed autotransplantation include the increased potential for infection from contaminated or nonviable autologous skin grafts. </li>
    <li>The harm associated with storing the patient's autologous vein for delayed autotransplantation is the increased potential for infection from contaminated or nonviable autologous vein grafts. </li>
    <li>The harm associated with replantation or autotransplantation of contaminated autologous grafts is the increased potential for the patient to develop a surgical site infection. </li>
    <li>The harm associated with culturing tissue to determine the level and identity of microbial growth on autologous tissue surfaces is that the patient may receive unnecessary antibiotics or other treatments to prevent infection. </li>
