	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

        <li>Review available laboratory test results including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation profiles. </li>
        <li>Order additional laboratory tests depending on a patient's medical condition (e.g., coagulopathy, anemia). </li>
        <li>Conduct a physical examination of the patient (e.g., ecchymosis, petechiae, pallor). </li>
        <li>If possible, perform the preoperative evaluation well enough in advance (e.g., several days to weeks) to allow for proper patient preparation. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Preadmission Patient Preparation</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Erythropoietin with or without iron may be administered when possible to reduce the need for allogeneic blood in selected patient populations (e.g., renal insufficiency, anemia of chronic disease, refusal of transfusion).&amp;Dagger;&amp;Dagger;&amp;Dagger;&amp;Dagger; </li>
        <li>Administer iron to patients with iron deficiency anemia if time permits. </li>
        <li>In consultation with an appropriate specialist, discontinue anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin, anti-Xa drugs, antithrombin agents) for elective surgery.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If clinically possible, discontinue nonaspirin antiplatelet agents (e.g., thienopyridines such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) for a sufficient time in advance of surgery, except for patients with a history of percutaneous coronary interventions.&amp;sect;&amp;sect;&amp;sect;&amp;sect;

        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The risk of thrombosis versus the risk of increased bleeding should be considered when altering anticoagulation status. </li>
        <li>Assure that blood and blood components are available for patients when significant blood loss or transfusion is expected. </li>

        <li>A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration.***
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>The determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10 g/dl justify or require red blood cell transfusion should be based on potential or actual ongoing bleeding (rate and magnitude), intravascular volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and adequacy of cardiopulmonary reserve. </li>
            <li>Red blood cells should be administered unit-by-unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used as a strategy to reduce blood loss for patients in whom transfusion is refused or is not possible. </li>
        <li>A massive (i.e., hemorrhagic) transfusion protocol may be used when available as a strategy to optimize the delivery of blood products to massively bleeding patients. </li>
        <li>Use a maximal surgical blood order schedule, when available and in accordance with your institutional policy, as a strategy to improve the efficiency of blood ordering practices. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Reversal of Anticoagulants</em></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>For urgent reversal of warfarin, administer prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) in consultation with the appropriate specialist, or administer fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). </li>
        <li>Administer vitamin K for selected patients for nonurgent reversal of warfarin, except when rapid restoration of anti-coagulation after surgery is required. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Antifibrinolytics for Prophylaxis of Excessive Blood Loss</em></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Use antifibrinolytic therapy for prophylaxis of the use of allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. </li>
        <li>Consider using antifibrinolytic therapy for prophylaxis in certain orthopedic surgery. </li>
        <li>Consider using antifibrinolytic therapy for prophylaxis in liver surgery and other clinical circumstances at high-risk for excessive bleeding.&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger; </li>

    <p><em>Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH)</em></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Intraoperative and Postoperative Management of Blood Loss</strong>
    <p><em>Allogeneic Red Blood Cell Transfusion</em></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Administer blood without consideration of duration of storage. </li>
        <li>Leukocyte-reduced blood may be used for transfusion for the purpose of reducing complications associated with allogeneic blood transfusion. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Reinfusion of Recovered Red Blood Cells</em></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Reinfuse recovered red blood cells as a blood-sparing intervention in the intraoperative period, when appropriate. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Intraoperative and Postoperative Patient Monitoring</em></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Periodically conduct a visual assessment of the surgical field jointly with the surgeon to assess the presence of excessive microvascular (i.e., coagulopathy) or surgical bleeding. </li>
        <li>Use standard methods for quantitative measurement of blood loss, including checking suction canisters, surgical sponges, and surgical drains. </li>
        <li>Monitor for perfusion of vital organs using standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrocardiography) in addition to observing clinical symptoms and physical exam features.|||
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Additional monitoring may include echocardiography, renal monitoring (urine output), cerebral monitoring (i.e., cerebral oximetry and near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]), analysis of arterial blood gasses, and mixed venous oxygen saturation. </li>

            <li>Obtain a platelet count before transfusion of platelets, if possible (see Table 1 in the original guideline document for suggested transfusion criteria for platelets).### In addition, obtain a test of platelet function, if available, in patients with suspected or drug-induced (e.g., clopidogrel) platelet dysfunction. </li>
            <li>Obtain coagulation tests (i.e., prothrombin time [PT] or INR and aPTT) before transfusion of FFP, if possible (see Table 1 in the original guideline document for suggested transfusion criteria for FFP).**** </li>
            <li>Assess fibrinogen levels before the administration of cryoprecipitate, if possible (see Table 1 in the original guideline document for suggested transfusion criteria for cryoprecipitate). </li>
            <li>Desmopressin may be used in patients with excessive bleeding and platelet dysfunction. </li>
            <li>Consider topical hemostatics such as fibrin glue or thrombin gel. </li>
            <li>Consider the use of antifibrinolytics (i.e., &amp;epsilon;-aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid) if fibrinolysis is documented or suspected and if these agents are not already being used. </li>
            <li>PCCs may be used in patients with excessive bleeding and increased INR. </li>
            <li>Consider recombinant activated factor VII when traditional options for treating excessive bleeding due to coagulopathy have been exhausted.&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger; </li>

<p>Findings from the aggregated literature are reported in the text of the Guidelines by evidence category, level, and direction. Evidence categories refer specifically to the strength and quality of the <em>research design</em> of the studies. Category A evidence represents results obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and Category B evidence represents observational results obtained from non randomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups. When available, Category A evidence is given precedence over Category B evidence in the reporting of results. These evidence categories are further divided into evidence levels. Evidence levels refer specifically to the strength and quality of the summarized study <em>findings</em> (i.e., statistical findings, type of data, and the number of studies reporting/replicating the findings) within the two evidence categories. For this document, only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention, including a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocality for each outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>
<p>RCTs report comparative findings between clinical interventions for specified outcomes. Statistically significant (P &amp;lt; 0.01) outcomes are designated as either beneficial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E).</p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis,* and meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains multiple RCTs, but the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these updated Guidelines. Findings from these RCTs are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains a single RCT, and findings from this study are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Category B</strong></p>
<p>Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups may permit <em>inference</em> of beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes. Inferred findings are given a directional designation of beneficial (B), harmful (H), or equivocal (E). For studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is <em>P</em>&amp;lt;0.01.</p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains observational comparisons (e.g., cohort, case-control research designs) between clinical interventions for a specified outcome.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains observational studies with associative statistics (e.g., relative risk, correlation, sensitivity/specificity).</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, percentages).</p>
<p><em>Level 4</em>: The literature contains case reports.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Literature</strong></p>
<p>The <em>lack</em> of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable (i.e., no pertinent studies found) or inadequate. Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes, as such literature does not permit a clear interpretation of findings due to methodological concerns (e.g., confounding in study design or implementation) or does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the &quot;Focus&quot; of the Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Opinion-Based Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>All opinion-based evidence (e.g., survey data, open-forum testimony, internet-based comments, letters, and editorials relevant to each topic was considered in the development of these updated Guidelines. However, only the findings obtained from formal surveys are reported.</p>
<p>Opinion surveys were developed for this update by the Task Force to address each clinical intervention identified in the document. Identical surveys were distributed to expert consultants and a random sample of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) members.</p>
<p><strong>Category A: Expert Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Survey responses from Task Force-appointed expert consultants are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of consultant survey responses reported in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Category B: Membership Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Survey responses from active ASA members are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of ASA member survey responses reported in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Survey responses from expert and membership sources are recorded using a 5-point scale and summarized based on median values.**</p>
<p><em>Strongly Agree</em>: Median score of 5 (At least 50% of the responses are 5)</p>
<p><em>Agree</em>: Median score of 4 (At least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5)</p>
<p><em>Equivocal</em>: Median score of 3 (At least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other response category or combination of similar categories contain at least 50% of the responses)</p>
<p><em>Disagree</em>: Median score of 2 (At least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2)</p>
<p><em>Strongly Disagree</em>: Median score of 1 (At least 50% of responses are 1)</p>
<p><strong>Category C: Informal Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Open-forum testimony obtained during development of these Guidelines, Internet-based comments, letters, and editorials are all informally evaluated and discussed during the formulation of Guideline recommendations. When warranted, the Task Force may add educational information or cautionary notes based on this information.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*All meta-analyses are conducted by the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters methodology group. Meta-analyses from other sources are reviewed but not included as evidence in this document.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Initially, each pertinent study finding was classified and summarized to determine meta-analysis potential. Literature pertaining to 11 evidence linkages contained enough studies with well-defined experimental designs and statistical information sufficient for meta-analyses. These linkages were (1) erythropoietin versus placebo, (2) &amp;epsilon;-aminocaproic acid versus placebo; (3) tranexamic acid versus placebo administered before or during surgery, (4) acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) versus no ANH; (5) ANH with intraoperative red blood cell recovery versus red blood cell recovery alone, (6) restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy, (7) intraoperative red blood cell recovery versus conventional transfusion, (8) desmopressin versus placebo, (9) tranexamic acid versus placebo administered after surgery, (10) fibrin glue versus no fibrin glue, and (11) recombinant activated factor VII versus placebo (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>General variance-based effect-size estimates or combined probability tests were obtained for continuous outcome measures, and Mantel&amp;ndash;Haenszel odds ratios were obtained for dichotomous outcome measures. Two combined probability tests were employed as follows: (1) the Fisher combined test, producing chi-square values based on logarithmic transformations of the reported <em>P</em> values from the independent studies, and (2) the Stouffer combined test, providing weighted representation of the studies by weighting each of the standard normal deviates by the size of the sample. An odds ratio procedure based on the Mantel&amp;ndash;Haenszel method for combining study results using 2&amp;times;2 ables was used with outcome frequency information. An acceptable significance level was set at <em>P</em>&amp;lt;0.01 (one-tailed). Tests for heterogeneity of the independent studies were conducted to assure consistency among the study results. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects odds ratios were obtained when significant heterogeneity was found (<em>P</em>&amp;lt;0.01). To control for potential publishing bias, a &quot;fail-safe n&quot; value was calculated. No search for unpublished studies was conducted, and no reliability tests for locating research results were done. To be accepted as significant findings, Mantel&amp;ndash;Haenszel odds ratios must agree with combined test results whenever both types of data are assessed. In the absence of Mantel&amp;ndash;Haenszel odds ratios, findings from both the Fisher and weighted Stouffer combined tests must agree with each other to be acceptable as significant.</p>
<p>For the previous update, interobserver agreement among Task Force members and two methodologists was established by inter-rater reliability testing. Agreement levels using a kappa (&amp;kappa;) statistic for two-rater agreement pairs were as follows: (1) type of study design, &amp;kappa;=0.83&amp;ndash;0.94; (2) type of analysis, &amp;kappa;=0.87&amp;ndash;0.94; (3) evidence linkage assignment, &amp;kappa;=0.89&amp;ndash;0.96; and (4) literature inclusion for database, &amp;kappa;=0.44&amp;ndash;0.78. Three-rater chance-corrected agreement values were: (1) study design, Sav=0.89, Var (Sav)=0.004; (2) type of analysis, Sav=0.88, Var (Sav)=0.004; (3) linkage assignment, Sav=0.92 Var (Sav)=0.002; (4) literature database inclusion, Sav=0.58 Var (Sav)=0.054. These values represent moderate to high levels of agreement.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus-based Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>For the previous update, consensus was obtained from multiple sources, including: (1) survey opinion from consultants who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in perioperative blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies, (2) survey opinions from a randomly selected sample of active members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), (3) testimony from attendees of two publicly held open forums at two national anesthesia meetings,* (4) Internet commentary, and (5) Task Force opinion and interpretation. The survey rate of return was 31% (n=21 of 67) for consultants, and 29% (n=87 of 300) for membership respondents. Survey results are reported in Tables 3 and 4 in the original guideline document, and summarized in the text of the Guidelines.</p>
<p>For the previous update, the consultants were asked to indicate which, if any, of the evidence linkages would change their clinical practices if the Guidelines were instituted. The rate of return was 24% (n=16 of 67). The percent of responding consultants expecting <em>no change</em> associated with each linkage were as follows: preoperative evaluation&amp;mdash;75%; discontinuation of anticoagulation and delay of surgery&amp;mdash;94%; drugs to manage perioperative anemia&amp;mdash;75%; drugs to promote coagulation and minimize blood loss&amp;mdash;81%; preoperative autologous blood collection&amp;mdash;88%; monitoring for inadequate perfusion and oxygenation&amp;mdash;94%; monitoring for transfusion indications&amp;mdash;88%; transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells&amp;mdash;94%, transfusion of autologous blood&amp;mdash; 100%; transfusion of platelets&amp;mdash;88%; transfusion of frozen plasma&amp;mdash;88%; transfusion of cryoprecipitate&amp;mdash;94%; treatment of excessive bleeding&amp;mdash;88%; and monitoring and laboratory testing for transfusion reactions&amp;mdash;88%. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents indicated that the Guidelines would have <em>no effect</em> on the amount of time spent on a typical case. Two respondents (12%) indicated that there would be an increase in the amount of time they would spend on a typical case with the implementation of these Guidelines. The amount of increased time anticipated by these respondents was 5 and 10 min.</p>

<p>In 2012, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters requested that the updated Guidelines published in 2006 be re-evaluated. This current revision consists of a literature evaluation and an evaluation of new survey findings of expert consultants and ASA members. A summary of recommendations is found in Appendix 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>This revision was developed by an ASA appointed Task Force of 10 members, consisting of anesthesiologists in both private and academic practices from various geographic areas of the United States, a pathologist specializing in transfusion medicine, and two consulting methodologists from the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters.</p>
<p>The Task Force developed the Guidelines by means of a seven-step process. First, they reached consensus on the criteria for evidence of effective blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies. Second, original published research studies from peer-reviewed journals relevant to the perioperative management of patients undergoing blood transfusions were reviewed. Third, the panel of expert consultants was asked to (1) participate in opinion surveys on the effectiveness of various perioperative management strategies and (2) review and comment on a draft of the Guidelines developed by the Task Force. Fourth, opinions about the Guideline recommendations were solicited from random samples of active members of the ASA. Fifth, the Task Force held open forums at two major national meetings to solicit input on its draft recommendations*. National organizations representing specialties whose members typically care for patients undergoing perioperative transfusion were invited to participate in the open forums. Sixth, the consultants were surveyed to assess their opinions on the feasibility of implementing the Guidelines. Seventh, all available information was used to build consensus within the Task Force to finalize the Guidelines.</p>
