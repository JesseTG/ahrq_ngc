	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The systematic review sought to answer the following question: What is the effectiveness of cancer rehabilitation interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to address the activity and participation needs of adult cancer survivors in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, work, leisure, social participation, and rest and sleep? </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Method</span></strong></p>
<p>Search terms for the review were developed by the methodology consultant to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) Evidence-based Practice (EBP) Project and AOTA staff, in consultation with the review authors of the question and the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table D.1 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to population (adults with cancer), types of intervention, outcomes, sequelae, and types of study design included in the systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and improved the search strategies. </p>
<p>Databases and sites searched included MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and OTseeker. In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were included in the search. These databases are peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct systematic reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Reference lists from articles included in the systematic reviews were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included. </p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature that is incorporated into a review. Included articles were peer-reviewed scientific literature on participants with cancer published in English between 1995 and 2014 and within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non&amp;ndash;peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. The review also excluded studies focusing on caregivers, family members, and friends, rather than on cancer survivors, and studies of childhood cancer. Studies included in the review provide Level I, II, and III evidence. Level IV evidence was included only when higher level evidence on a given topic was not found; no Level V studies were included.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Selection of Articles</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 8,436 citations and abstracts were identified through searches of databases and reference lists of articles included in the review. Removal of duplicates left 6,717 citations and abstracts. The three-person review team completed the step of eliminating references on the basis of citations and abstracts. A total of 945 full-text articles remained and were retrieved. After the initial full-text review, the articles were reduced to 437, which received an in-depth full review.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>A major focus of the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA's) Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) projects is an ongoing program of systematic review of multidisciplinary scientific literature, using focused questions and standardized procedures to identify practice-relevant evidence and discuss its implications for practice, education, and research. An evidence-based perspective is founded on the assumption that scientific evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention can be judged to be more or less strong and valid according to a hierarchy of research designs, an assessment of the quality of the research, or both. </p>
<p>AOTA uses standards of evidence modeled on those developed in evidence-based medicine. This model standardizes and ranks the value of scientific evidence for biomedical practice using a grading system. In this system, the highest level of evidence, Level I, includes systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group, and the outcomes of both groups are compared. Other levels of evidence include Level II studies, in which assignment to a treatment or a control group is not randomized (cohort study); Level III studies, which do not have a control group; Level IV studies, which use a single-case experimental design, sometimes reported over several participants; and Level V studies, which are case reports and expert opinion that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements. </p>
<p>The systematic review on adults with cancer was supported by AOTA as part of the EBP Project. AOTA is committed to supporting the role of occupational therapy in this important area of practice. </p>
<p>The systematic review covered the period from 1995 to 2014 because occupational therapy practitioners need access to the results of the latest and best available literature to support intervention within the scope of occupational therapy practice. The question that was the basis for the review was developed by the review authors and reviewed by an advisory group of content experts in the field (occupational therapists and physician oncologists), AOTA staff, and the methodology consultant to the AOTA EBP Project.</p></div>"/>
