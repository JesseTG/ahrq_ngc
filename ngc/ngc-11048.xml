	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>This guideline update process commenced with literature searches that included electronic databases, personal contact with key researchers of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) and low back pain, and internet search engines. In August 2014, a member of the Task Force conducted a literature search using keywords including <em>back pain, low back pain, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), osteopathic, manual therapy</em>, and <em>randomized controlled trials</em> (RCT) in PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, and Springer Link databases from 2003 to 2014. During this search, the systematic review by Franke et al. published in August 2014 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) was discovered and a determination was made to base the revised guidelines on this publication.</p>
<p>Franke et al. searched electronic reference databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, OSTMED.DR, and Osteopathic Web Research using the following search terms: <em>low back pain, back pain, lumbopelvic pain, dorsalgia, osteopathic manipulative treatment, OMT</em>, and <em>osteopathic medicine</em>. In addition to the listed databases, the authors conducted searches in an ongoing trial database (metaRegister of Controlled Trials). To enhance their search, Franke et al. tracked citations of identified trials, and manually searched reference lists for other relevant papers.</p>
<p>Franke et al. searched electronic databases, reference lists and personal communications. Their inclusion criteria consisted of randomized clinical trials of adults (&amp;gt;18 years of age) with nonspecific back pain treated by osteopathic physicians or osteopaths who used their clinical judgment as opposed to a standard predetermined protocol. Studies with pregnant and postpartum participants were also included. Studies excluded from the review were those where co-interventions were not performed on both comparison groups; the OMT intervention could not be assigned an effect size; participants had specific back pain from pathology (i.e., fracture, tumor, metastasis, inflammation, infection); or the intervention consisted of a single manual technique.</p>
<p>Also in August 2014, personal communications yielded 2 additional articles by Hensel et al and Licciardone and Aryal published after Franke et al. conducted their systematic review. No other studies were identified. Refer to the original guideline document for information on inclusion of these articles.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Franke et al. reviewed all of the studies using a standardized form, and all mean differences (MD) and standard mean differences (SMD) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Overall effect size was calculated at the 3-month posttreatment follow-up. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, as recommended by the updated Cochrane Back Review Group method guidelines, was used to assess quality of evidence.</p>
<p>Franke et al. evaluated the methodological quality of the studies using the Risk of Bias tool of the Cochrane Back Review Group. Studies were scored as &quot;low risk,&quot; &quot;high risk,&quot; or &quot;unclear,&quot; and included assessments of randomization, blinding, baseline comparability between groups, patient compliance, and dropping out. Per the Cochrane Back Review Group, studies received a &quot;low risk&quot; score when a minimum of 6 criteria were met and it was determined that the study had no serious flaws (e.g., a drop-out rate over 50%). Disagreements about the quality of the studies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Franke et al. used Review Manager to analyze the data for the meta-analysis. The authors converted the number rating scale (NRS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from the included studies to a 100-point scale for the pain measurement, and calculated the MD with 95% CIs for the random effects model.</p>
<p>Franke et al. conducted other noteworthy analyses. The SMD was used in a random effects model to determine functional status. The authors grouped the 1 study examining acute low back pain (LBP) and the 3 studies examining patients with both acute and chronic LBP together for the purpose of their meta-analyses. Overall, they created four groups: (1) acute and chronic LBP; (2) chronic LBP (duration of pain more than 3 months); (3) LBP in pregnant women; and (4) LBP in postpartum women.</p>
<p>Franke et al. also assessed the clinical relevance of each study using the Cochrane Back Review Group recommendations. A small effect was defined as MD less than 10% of the scale and SMD less than 0.5. A medium effect was defined as MD 10% to 20% of the scale and SMD from 0.5 to 0.8. A large effect was defined as MD greater than 20% of the scale and SMD greater than 0.8.</p></div>"/>

For Franke et al., the majority of the included studies had relatively small sample sizes, but collectively, there were over 400 participants included in the analysis of chronic and acute pain and for chronic pain. Unfortunately, the separate analysis of low back pain (LBP) in pregnant and postpartum women was collectively a smaller sample (&amp;lt;400 participants), which indicated an imprecision of results and a downgrading of the level of evidence. Also, as Franke et al. alluded to in their article, the control groups included in studies need to be more compatible to the osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) intervention groups.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the studies included in the Franke review was the absence of reporting on the exact OMT interventions performed for each patient; only a range of manual techniques for OMT were included. The lack of specific information on the delivery of OMT results in the inability to ascertain the treatment received by different patient groups or to identify the most effective OMT interventions for LBP.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>One of the barriers to application of the recommendations cited by osteopathic physicians has been poor reimbursement for osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). However, Medicare has reimbursed osteopathic physicians for this procedure for over 30 years. Many osteopathic physicians apparently do not utilize OMT in clinical practice due to a number of barriers, including time constraints, lack of confidence, loss of skill over time from disuse, and inadequate office space. Some specialists (i.e., pathologists and radiologists) do not use OMT as it is not applicable to their duties within their specialty. The American Osteopathic Association (AOA) believes patients with low back pain should be treated with OMT given the high level of evidence that supports its efficacy. Changes in care when these guidelines are implemented will be determined by physician and patient surveys, billing and coding practice patterns amongst osteopathic physicians, data gathered from osteopathic physicians via the AOA's Clinical Assessment Program, and other registry data gathering tools currently being developed by researchers.</p></div>"/>
