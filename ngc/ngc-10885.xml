	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;26&quot;>
    <li>For patients with alcohol or opioid use disorder in early abstinence, the Work Group suggests using standardized measures to assess the severity of withdrawal symptoms such as Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (revised version) (CIWA-Ar) for alcohol or Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) for opioids. (<strong>Weak For; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends inpatient medically supervised alcohol withdrawal management for patients with any of the following conditions:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>History of delirium tremens or withdrawal seizures </li>
        <li>Inability to tolerate oral medication </li>

<p><strong>Alcohol Use Disorder Stabilization and Withdrawal</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;29&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends using one of the following pharmacotherapy strategies for managing alcohol withdrawal symptoms:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>A predetermined fixed medication tapering schedule with additional medication as needed </li>
        <li>Symptom-triggered therapy where patients are given medication only when signs or symptoms of withdrawal occur (e.g., as needed dosing) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(<strong>Strong For; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>For treatment of moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal, the Work Group recommends using benzodiazepines with adequate monitoring because of documented efficacy and high margin of safety. (<strong>Strong For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>For managing mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal in patients for whom risks of benzodiazepines outweigh benefits (e.g., inadequate monitoring available, abuse liability, or allergy/adverse reactions), the Work Group suggests considering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an alternative. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends against using alcohol as an agent for medically supervised withdrawal. (<strong>Strong Against; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;33&quot;>
    <li>For patients not yet stabilized from opioid use disorder, the Work Group recommends against withdrawal management alone due to high risk of relapse and overdose (see Recommendations 8 and 11 above). (<strong>Strong Against; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>Among patients with opioid use disorder for whom maintenance agonist treatment is contraindicated, unacceptable, or unavailable, the Work Group recommends using a methadone (in Opioid Treatment Program only) or buprenorphine taper for opioid withdrawal management (see Recommendation 11). (<strong>Strong For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with opioid use disorder for whom methadone and buprenorphine are contraindicated, unacceptable, or unavailable, the Work Group recommends offering clonidine as a second-line agent for opioid withdrawal management (see Recommendation 11).

</ol>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, &quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;Weak.&quot; A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>The grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or &quot;The guideline panel recommends offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak For</strong> (or &quot;The guideline panel suggests offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak Against</strong> (or &quot;The guideline panel suggests not offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or &quot;The guideline panel recommends against offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed &quot;Conditional,&quot; &quot;Discretionary,&quot; or &quot;Qualified.&quot; Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Categories and Definitions</strong></p>
<p>For use in the 2015 SUDs clinical practice guideline (SUD CPG), a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2009 SUD CPG.</p>

<p>The clinical practice guideline (CPG) Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying Key Questions (KQs) to guide the systematic review (SR) of the literature on substance use disorders (SUDs). These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations. The KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A‐1 in the original guideline provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology.</p>
<p>The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs were not able to be included in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, and those were included in the review. Table A-2 in the original guideline contains the final set of KQs used to guide the SR for this CPG.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conducting the Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Extensive literature searches using the search terms and strategy included in Appendix H of the original guideline document identified 4,708 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 2,100 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, not a full-length article). Overall, 2,608 abstracts were reviewed with 1,621 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not a SR or clinical study, did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not enroll a population of interest, or published prior to November 2007. A total of 987 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 682 were excluded at a first pass review for the following: not addressing a KQ of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for clinical study or SR, not meeting inclusion criteria for any KQ, or being a duplicate. A total of 305 full-length articles were thought to address one or more KQs and were further reviewed. Of these, 184 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A-1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Overall, 135 studies (in 136 articles) addressed one or more of the KQs and were considered as evidence in this review. Table A-2 of the original guideline indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Abstracting and Managing Data</span></strong></p>
<p>For each study included in the review, the following study level details were abstracted: country, purpose, and quality rating. For previous systematic reviews, the search strategy used, study selection criteria, and overall information about the evidence base, including number of included studies and overall patients enrolled were reported. For all studies, reviewers abstracted data about characteristics of the included patients and interventions being assessed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessing Individual Studies' Methodological Quality (i.e., Internal Validity or Risk of Bias)</span></strong></p>
<p>As per the Department of Veteran Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) <em>Guidelines for Guidelines</em> document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), risk-of-bias (or study quality) of individual studies and previous systematic reviews was assessed using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) method. Each study was assigned a rating of Good, Fair, or Poor based on sets of criteria that vary depending on study design. Detailed lists of criteria and definitions of Good, Fair, or Poor ratings for different study designs appear in Appendix VII of the <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Home/GetFile/6/7/procedure-manual_2015/pdf&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>USPSTF procedure manual</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence review team used a narrative approach to synthesizing the evidence for all the Key Questions (KQs). As indicated in the VA/DoD <em>Guidelines for Guidelines</em> document, the first line of evidence was previous systematic reviews. For questions in which a previous review was available, individual studies that met this review's inclusion criteria were used to supplement or update the previous review. The reviewers considered whether subsequent evidence supports the conclusions reported in the previous review. For questions for which no previous review was available, the reviewers summarized the overall findings for the outcomes of interest of the studies that addressed a key question.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessing the Overall Quality of the Body of Evidence for an Outcome</span></strong></p>
<p>The overall quality of the body of evidence supporting the findings for the outcomes of interest in this report was assessed using the&amp;nbsp;Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The GRADE system primarily involves consideration of the following factors: overall study quality (or overall risk of bias or study limitations), consistency of evidence, directness of evidence, and precision of evidence. Given time and resources, other factors such as publication bias may also be considered.</p>
<p>The GRADE system rates the overall quality of the evidence as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). For instance, a body of evidence that consists of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) automatically starts with a rating of high quality. This rating can be downgraded if some of the RCTs have serious flaws such as lack of blinding of outcome assessors, not reporting concealment of allocation, or high dropout rate. Similarly, the quality can be downgraded or further downgraded if inconsistencies of findings are present or if there is a lack of precision surrounding an outcome's effect size. For more information on the GRADE system go to the <a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE working group Web site&quot;>GRADE working group Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessing Applicability</span></strong></p>
<p>When describing the evidence base addressing a KQ, the evidence review team discussed aspects of the included studies, such as characteristics of included patients and treatments being assessed that may make the overall findings of the studies more or less applicable to the population, treatments, or outcomes of interest to this review.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The current document is an update to the 2009 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)/Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Management of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs). The methodology used in developing the 2015 CPG follows the <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal document of the VA and DoD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development and submission of a new or updated SUD CPG.</p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare systems. Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (s) of the most clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management of patients with SUD. The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The amount of new scientific evidence that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was also taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes </li>
</ul>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified three clinical leaders as Champions for the 2015 CPG.</p>
<p>The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in October 2014, with participation from the contracting officer's representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, participants discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review (SR) about the management of SUD. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of SUD, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: psychiatry, psychology, nursing, pharmacy, social work, primary care, family medicine, religious and spiritual services, bioethics, dietetics, pain, addiction psychiatry, addiction medicine, and substance use specialties.</p>
<p>The guideline development process for the 2015 CPG update consisted of the following steps:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Formulating and prioritizing evidence questions (KQs) </li>
    <li>Conducting the SR </li>
    <li>Convening a face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting and submitting a final CPG about the management of SUD to the VA/DoD EBPWG </li>
</ol>
<p>Appendix A in the original guideline document provides a detailed description of each of these tasks.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Convening the Face-to-face Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p>In consultation with the contracting officer's representative (COR), the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and a half day face-to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on April 14-17, 2015. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2009 SUD CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review of KQs 1-10 in order to facilitate and inform the process.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the 2009 SUD CPG, modifying the recommendations as necessary. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not presented in the 2009 SUD CPG, based on the 2015 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into three smaller subgroups at this meeting.</p>
<p>As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation.</p>
<p>In addition to developing recommendations during the face-to-face meeting, the Work Group members also revised the 2009 SUD CPG algorithms to reflect the new and amended recommendations. They discussed the available evidence as well as changes in clinical practice since 2009, as necessary, to update the algorithms.</p>
<p>KQs 11 and 12 were developed following the face-to-face meeting, after the need to systematically review the evidence related to stabilization for withdrawal from alcohol and opioids was identified. For KQs 11 and 12, the process for developing and categorizing recommendations was adapted to be used in a teleconference format following the face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes </li>
    <li>Confidence in the quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Values and preferences </li>
    <li>Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Resource Use </li>
        <li>Equity </li>
        <li>Acceptability </li>
        <li>Feasibility </li>
        <li>Subgroup considerations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Table A-3 in the original guideline document (&quot;Evidence to Recommendations Framework&quot;) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain.</p>
<p>Using this system, the Champions and Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak). A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they give a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>They also determined the direction of each recommendation (For or Against). Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendation&quot; field in this summary).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Reconciling 2009 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence-based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on new evidence, or as scheduled, subject to time-based expirations. For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations pertaining to preventive services. Further, the inclusion criteria for the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) specify that a guideline must have been developed, reviewed, or revised within the past five years.</p>
<p>The SUD Guideline Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Guideline Work Group considered, without complete review of the relevant evidence, the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the previous 2009 SUD CPG, subject to evolving practice in today's environment.</p>
<p>A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which older recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the categories took into account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation was systematically reviewed, the degree to which the recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current patient care environment and inside the scope of the CPG (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendation&quot; field). Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Appendix A of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The CPG Work Group recognized the need to accommodate the transition in evidence rating systems from the 2009 SUD CPG to the current CPG. In order to report the strength of all recommendations using a consistent format (i.e., the GRADE system) the CPG Work Group converted the USPSTF strengths of the recommendation accompanying the carryover recommendations from the 2009 guideline to the GRADE system. As such, the CPG Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recommendation in the 2009 SUD CPG as well as harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where possible. The CPG Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2009 SUD CPG and did not re-assess the evidence systematically. In some instances, peer-reviewed literature published since the 2009 SUD CPG was considered along with the evidence base used for that CPG.</p>
<p>Where such newer literature was considered when converting the strength of the recommendation from the USPSTF to the GRADE system, it is referenced in the discussion that follows the corresponding recommendation (see the original guideline document), as well as in Appendix D of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The CPG Work Group recognizes that, while there are practical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous SR, previous recommendations, or recent peer-reviewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive SR and, therefore, may introduce bias. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discussion sections from the 2009 SUD CPG to support the amended &quot;carried forward&quot; recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2009 SUD CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made additional revisions to the algorithms, as necessary.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, &quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;Weak.&quot; A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>

    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends against offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed &quot;Conditional,&quot; &quot;Discretionary,&quot; or &quot;Qualified.&quot; Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Categories and Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>For use in the 2015 substance use disorders (SUDs) clinical practice guideline (SUD CPG), a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2009 SUD CPG.</p>

    <li>When properly executed, patient-centered care (PCC) may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment adherence. Improved patient-clinician communication through PCC can be used to convey openness to discuss any future concerns. </li>
    <li>Although there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against measurement-based care in either primary or specialty care settings for improving consumption and health outcomes, there are a number of benefits to consider which include:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Patient accountability (&quot;No one will know&quot; is a common trigger for relapse) </li>
        <li>Continual feedback and monitoring of treatment response </li>

    <li>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines are based upon the best information available at the time of publication. They are designed to provide information and assist decision-making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. </li>
    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation. </li>
    <li>Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when providers take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. </li>
    <li>These guidelines are not intended to represent TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits may be found at <a href=&quot;http://www.tricare.mil/&quot; title=&quot;TRICARE Web site&quot;>www.tricare.mil</a> or by contacting your regional TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor. </li>

<p>This clinical practice guideline (CPG) and algorithms are designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with consideration of local needs and resources. The algorithms serve as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of an episode of care.</p>
<p>Although this CPG represents the recommended practice on the date of its publication, medical practice is evolving and this evolution requires continuous updating based on published information. New technology and more research will improve patient care in the future. The CPG can assist in identifying priority areas for research and to inform optimal allocation of resources. Future studies examining the results of CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly relevant to clinical practice.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (COI) in the past 12 months. Verbal affirmations of no COI were used as necessary during meetings throughout the guideline development process. The project team was also subject to random Web-based surveillance (e.g., ProPublica). Disclosed industry related COIs are listed in Appendix G of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), then it was reported to the Office of Evidence Based Practice. It was also discussed with the Substance Use Disorders Clinical Practice Guideline (SUD CPG) Work Group in tandem with their review of the evidence and development of recommendations. The Office of Evidence Based Practice and the SUD CPG Work Group determined whether or not action, such as restricting participation and/or voting on sections related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If it was deemed necessary, action was taken by the co-chairs and Office of Evidence Based Practice, based on the level and extent of involvement, to mitigate the COI.</p>
<p>Several Work Group members disclosed relationships and/or affiliations which had the potential to introduce bias into the guideline. Based on the level and extent of involvement, no individuals were removed from the Work Group. In order to mitigate the risk of bias while maximizing the contributions of those with expertise in a specific area of SUD treatment, co-chairs asked Work Group members to disclose relevant relationships during related guideline development discussions. Members with potential COIs contributed to the discussions related to their particular areas of expertise as well as the overarching guideline document in order to ensure differing viewpoints and experiences were adequately represented.</p></div>"/>
