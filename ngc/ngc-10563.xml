	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for all infants for the first 4&amp;ndash;6 months (<strong>Evidence level: II&amp;ndash;III; Grade: C</strong>) (de Silva et al., 2014; Muraro et al., 2004; Kull et al, 2010; Venter et al., 2009; H&amp;oslash;st, Husby, &amp;amp; &amp;Oslash;sterballe, 1988; Lucas et al., 1990). </li>
    <li>Dietary restrictions are not recommended for all pregnant or lactating mothers (<strong>Evidence level: I&amp;ndash;II; Grade: B</strong>) (de Silva et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>If breastfeeding is insufficient or not possible:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>High-risk infants should receive a hypoallergenic formula with documented preventive effect for the first 4 months. Other infants may receive a standard formula. After the age of 4 months, a standard cow's milk-based formula is recommended according to standard nutrition recommendations, irrespective of atopic heredity (<strong>Evidence level: I; Grade: A&amp;ndash;B</strong>) (de Silva et al., 2014; Muraro et al., 2004; Zeiger et al., 1989; Zeiger, Heller, &amp;amp; Sampson, 1992; Zeiger &amp;amp; Heller, 1995; Odelram et al., 1996; von Berg et al., 2003; von Borg et al., 2008). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Introduction of complementary foods after the age of 4 months according to normal standard weaning practices and nutrition recommendations, for all children irrespective of atopic heredity (<strong>Evidence level: II&amp;ndash;III; Grade: C</strong>) (de Silva et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>No special dietary restrictions after the age of 4 months for infants with high risk for development of allergic disease No withholding or encouraging exposure to &quot;highly allergenic&quot; foods such as cow's milk, hen's egg, and peanuts irrespective of atopic heredity, once weaning has commenced (<strong>Evidence level: II&amp;ndash;III; Grade: C</strong>) (de Silva et al., 2014). </li>

<p><strong>Systematic Review of the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The initial full range of questions that were considered important were rationalized through several rounds of iteration to agree to one key overarching question:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the effectiveness of approaches for the primary prevention of food allergy? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The following databases were searched: Cochrane Library; MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ISI Web of Science, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP) Database, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Experts in the field were contacted for additional studies.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>This review focused solely on studies that were primarily concerned with preventing sensitization to food(s) and/or the development of food allergy. Studies seeking to prevent potential manifestations of food allergy such as atopic eczema/dermatitis or asthma, but not including an explicit diagnosis of sensitization to food or food allergy, were not included.</p>
<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and prospective cohort studies published up until 30 September 2012, were eligible. No language restrictions were applied and, where possible, relevant studies in languages other than English were translated.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of articles were checked by two independent reviewers and categorized as included, not included, and unsure. Full-text copies of potentially relevant studies were obtained, and their eligibility for inclusion was independently assessed by two reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus or discussion with other reviewers.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline was produced using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp;amp; Evaluation (AGREE II) approach. This is a structured approach to guideline production that is designed to ensure appropriate representation of the full range of stakeholders, a careful search for and critical appraisal of the relevant literature, a systematic approach to the formulation and presentation of recommendations, and steps to ensure that the risk of bias is minimized at each step of the process. An overview of the approach used is provided below.</p>
<p><strong>Clarifying the Scope and Purpose of the Guideline</strong></p>
<p>This process began in January 2012 with a meeting to discuss the overall approach to guideline development, including detailed discussions on the main aims of the guidelines, the target conditions, clarifying the target populations, to whom the recommendations applied, agreeing the intended end-user group, and ensuring adequate professional and lay representation in the guideline development process.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Appropriate Stakeholder Involvement</strong></p>
<p>Participants represented a range of European countries, and disciplinary and clinical backgrounds (including medical secondary care, primary care, and nursing), and patient groups. The Prevention Task Force continued to work together over the ensuing 18 months through email discussions, teleconferences, and face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The authors graded the overall strength and consistency of the evidence to translate the key findings from the systematic review into evidence-linked recommendations. This involved formulating clear recommendations and making clear the strength of evidence underpinning each recommendation. This ranged from consistent evidence derived from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials through to evidence derived from expert consensus. Experts identified the implications of implementing the recommendations, barriers and facilitators to the implementation of each recommendation, advice on approaches to implementing the recommendations and suggested audit criteria that can help with assessing organizational compliance with each recommendation.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Challenges in Interpreting the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Food allergy is a complex topic because the symptoms are diverse and allergies can manifest in many different forms. In children, only around one-third of parentally reported food allergy can be confirmed when appropriately investigated. In the population, immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to foods, as detected by skin prick test (SPT) or presence of specific IgE (sIgE), is not always associated with clinical reactions and food allergy. Because the diagnostic accuracy is suboptimal when based solely on history and/or sensitization, if possible a food allergy diagnosis needs to be confirmed by controlled elimination and challenge procedures. Unfortunately, most studies on the prevention of food allergy rely on reported reactions or surrogate markers of food allergy such as sensitization to foods (IgE and/or SPT) and disease outcomes, for example eczema. Moreover, it is important to be aware of the natural course of food allergy, as food allergies develop in the order of exposure to different foods and many children with food allergies, for example cow's milk allergy, develop tolerance during the first years of life. It is therefore important to investigate specific food allergies in the relevant age groups when they experience symptoms suggestive of food allergy and to investigate the specific food allergens that are relevant to that age group and geographic location. Finally, most studies are not sufficiently powered to detect clinically important reductions in the incidence of food allergy.</p>
<p>There are additional ethical and logistical challenges to be considered when interpreting or undertaking food allergy research in young children and infants. For example, it is not ethical to randomize mothers to breastfeeding, and evidence on this topic has therefore been based on high-quality observational studies. However, exclusively breastfed children may not be comparable to others due to self-selection, and these mothers may be more motivated to exclusively breastfeed due to family history of allergic problems or early symptoms in their children. Thus, there is a risk of reverse causation, which is not taken into consideration in most studies.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the quality assessment in the systematic review was, in keeping with standard practice, undertaken on methodological grounds, rather than on the clinical relevance or overall validity of the studies. When extracting the relevant evidence for the guidelines, it is also important to evaluate the scientific quality and clinical relevance of the studies.</p>
<p>Thus, for these recommendations on primary prevention of food allergy, the above-mentioned factors have been considered alongside the formal methodological quality assessment, and experimental studies reporting on confirmed food allergy are ranked highest, whereas studies with self-reported food allergy, atopic symptoms (which may represent food allergy), and sensitization as outcomes were included, but were ascribed less weight. Studies reporting only retrospective data were not included due to their high risk of bias.</p></div>"/>
