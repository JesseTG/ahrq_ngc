	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>Changes from the 2010 original task force report are bold.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup><strong>Excludes</strong> fractures of the femoral neck, intertrochanteric fractures with spiral subtrochanteric extension, periprosthetic fractures, and pathological fractures associated with primary or metastatic bone tumors and miscellaneous bone diseases (e.g., Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia).</p>
<p><strong>Update on Medical Management</strong></p>
<p>The natural history of AFFs suggests that they evolve over time, with initial development of a cortical &quot;bump&quot; that likely represents early periosteal thickening, and the eventual appearance of a transverse cortical lucency (fracture) in the region of periosteal thickening, which may or may not progress to a complete fracture. Until more evidence becomes available regarding the clinical significance of such areas of cortical thickening, the opinion of the task force is that such lesions, whether they are detected on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans or plain radiographs, should be further evaluated with higher-order imaging to determine whether a cortical lucency is associated with the periosteal thickening. Options for imaging include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which could detect a cortical fracture line and associated bone and marrow edema or hyperemia, indicative of a stress fracture. If MRI cannot be performed, computed tomography (CT) could detect the cortical fracture or lucency and associated new-bone formation. Radionuclide bone scan could detect focal bone and marrow hyperemia but with less specificity than MRI or CT. If higher-order imaging detects a cortical lucency, such a lesion could be considered an incomplete AFF. If no cortical lucency is present but marrow edema is present, then such lesions could be considered a stress reaction.</p>
<p>Suggested management of an incomplete AFF is summarized in the 2010 original task force report. For patients with a stress reaction, stress fracture, or incomplete or complete subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture, potent antiresorptive agents should be discontinued. Dietary calcium and vitamin D status should be assessed, and adequate supplementation prescribed. Prophylactic reconstruction nail fixation is recommended for incomplete fractures (with cortical lucency) accompanied by pain. If the patient has minimal pain, a trial of conservative therapy, in which weight-bearing is limited through the use of crutches or a walker, may be considered. However, if there is no symptomatic and radiographic improvement after 2 to 3 months of conservative therapy, prophylactic nail fixation should be strongly considered, because these patients may progress to a complete fracture. For patients with incomplete fractures and no pain, or those with periosteal thickening but no cortical lucency, limited weight-bearing may be continued and vigorous activity avoided. Reduced activity should be continued until there is no bone edema detected on MRI or no increased activity detected on bone scan.</p>
<p>Since the first task force report, there have been numerous anecdotal reports of medical therapy. Most reports extend early descriptions of using teriparatide (TPTD) in patients with AFFs. One study on the treatment of a 63-year-old woman with thigh pain and bilateral AFFs who had taken bisphosphonates (BPs) for 13 years. After 6 months of daily TPTD, her pain diminished, MRI revealed less edema around the fracture, and after 16 months, there was complete healing and relief of pain. Similarly, another research group described a 77-year-old woman whose AFF closed after only 1 month of TPTD. Interestingly, this latter group treated 2 other patients (women 63 and 77 years old) with strontium ranelate, with fracture closure after 2 and 3 months, respectively, of treatment. More recently, a third group described a 63-year-old woman treated with BPs for only 3 years who presented with thigh pain and a stress fracture. After 10 months of TPTD followed by 5 months of raloxifene, the fracture healed completely.</p>
<p>Another report provides information on a somewhat different case. A 70-year-old man with prostate cancer was treated with androgen deprivation therapy and 4 mg intravenous zoledronic acid monthly for 2 years. He complained of thigh pain and was found to have a transverse femoral shaft fracture. An orthopedic nailing procedure produced a further fracture. After 2 months of TPTD therapy, there was full healing.</p>
<p>Thus, discontinuation of BP therapy and TPTD treatment (and strontium ranelate in 2 cases) has been associated with fracture healing. Nonetheless, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of women with distal radius fractures, the efficacy of TPTD was questioned because although 20 &amp;micro;g daily appeared to hasten fracture healing, 40 &amp;micro;g daily dosing did not. Moreover, the unpublished clinical experience of bone experts is that only some patients appear to respond to TPTD. Variable response to TPTD was reflected in several reports of medical treatment of AFFs presented at the ASBMR Annual Meeting in 2012. One report described a 57-year-old Argentine woman who had been treated with alendronate for 7 years and sustained a non-healing FS fracture. Her pain improved after 10 days of TPTD and healing was complete after 3 months. However, another study reported that only 1 of 3 German patients with AFF responded to 2 years of TPTD. Similarly, another research group reported 13 Canadian women with BP-associated AFFs treated with TPTD. Three required surgery, 5 improved with TPTD, and the others did not improve or even worsened. In another study, bone biopsies were performed before and after TPTD treatment in 15 women with surgically‐treated AFFs. TPTD increased mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate, as expected. All patients appeared to improve clinically.</p>
<p>Finally, a study of 14 consecutive patients with AFFs was reported from Australia. Nine patients chose surgical or nonoperative management, and 5 opted for TPTD. High-resolution peripheral CT of the radius and tibia were performed before and 6 months after starting TPTD. Only 1 of the non-TPTD group had fracture healing (after 1 year). In the TPTD group, union occurred in 2 patients with the fracture line no longer visible. Two patients became pain-free and the remaining 3 patients had improvement in pain scores. Images, assessed by a novel software analysis, revealed less densely mineralized bone with TPTD treatment. In addition, bone turnover markers increased in the TPTD group.</p>
<p>In the absence of a randomized, placebo‐controlled trial, no definite conclusion can be reached regarding the efficacy of TPTD treatment of patients with AFF. From the low‐quality evidence available, the recommendations of the ASBMR task force for medical management remain reasonable: discontinuation of BPs, adequate calcium and vitamin D, and consideration of TPTD for those who appear not to heal on conservative therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Summary and Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>AFFs are characterized by unique radiographic (transverse fracture line, periosteal callus formation at the fracture site, little or no comminution) and clinical features (prodromal pain, bilaterality) that resemble stress fractures or reactions. Based upon new information, the task force revised the original case definition to highlight the unusual radiographic features that distinguish AFFs from ordinary osteoporotic femoral diaphyseal fractures and to provide more precise guidance on what is meant by transverse orientation. In addition, the requirement that fractures be noncomminuted was relaxed to include those with minimal comminution, the periosteal and/or endosteal stress reaction at the fracture site was moved from the minor to the major features, and the association with specific diseases and drug exposures was removed from the minor criteria, in the spirit that these associations should be sought rather than part of the case definition.</p>
<p>The epidemiological evidence for a relationship between BP use and atypical subtrochanteric and femoral shaft fractures has become more compelling. AFFs appear to be more common in patients who have been exposed to long-term BPs, usually for more than 3 years (median treatment 7 years), but every series includes patients who have not been treated with BPs, suggesting that the &quot;background rate&quot; of AFF in osteoporosis patients is not zero. Moreover, the risk for AFFs may decline after BPs are stopped. The majority of studies have found a significant association with&amp;nbsp;glucocorticoid use or duration. Although the relative risks of AFFs are very high in patients on BPs, ranging from 2.1 to 128, their absolute risk is extremely low, ranging from 3.2 to 50 cases per 100,000 person‐years. Thus, these fractures are rare, particularly when considered against the incidence of common osteoporotic fractures of all types and of ordinary&amp;nbsp;femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures, all of which have been proven to decrease with BP therapy. However, long‐term use may be associated with higher risk (&amp;gt;100 per 100,000 person-years). In conclusion, AFFs remain of concern and more information is urgently needed, both to assist in identifying patients at particular risk and to guide decision-making about duration of BP therapy.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Since publication of the first task force report in 2010, several studies have been published on the epidemiology of and risk factors for atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) and their relationship to bisphosphonate (BP) therapy. Certain studies have raised concerns about limitations of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) case definition and new data have emerged on the medical management of these fractures. Therefore, the ASBMR reconvened the task force at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the ASBMR.</p>
<p>A subcommittee of the task force held several conference calls on the case definition. Dr. Shane (epidemiology), Dr. Burr (pathogenesis), and Dr. Adler (medical management) wrote the first draft of the document, which was reviewed in detail by the task force members, and their revisions and concerns were addressed. The revised case definition was approved by formal vote, with 25 of 26 members voting to approve. The final report was also approved unanimously by formal vote.</p>
<p>Among the issues addressed by the task force was the case definition, which has been revised to more clearly delineate the features that distinguish atypical femur fractures (AFFs) from ordinary osteoporotic femur fractures. New epidemiologic studies, many of which incorporate radiographic review and provide new information on AFF incidence and association with bisphosphonates (BPs), and new data on the pathogenesis and management of AFFs were reviewed and summarized in the original guideline document. This document should be considered an update and companion to the first report, because much of the information in the first report has not been included here but is still valid and useful.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) is well served by the fact that many of those responsible for policy development and implementation have diverse interests and are involved in a variety of activities outside of the Society. Accordingly, the ASBMR requires all ASBMR Officers, Councilors, Committee Chairs, Editors-in-Chief, Associate Editors, and certain other appointed representatives to disclose any real or apparent conflicts of interest (including investments or positions in companies involved in the bone and mineral metabolism field), as well as any duality of interests (including affiliations, organizational interests, and/or positions held in entities relevant to the bone and mineral metabolism field and/or the ASBMR).</p>
<p>The committees, task forces, and editorial boards of the ASBMR and its publications carry out the work of the Society on behalf of the membership. The distinct functions of the committees, task forces, and editorial boards are intended to address the broad mission of the ASBMR: to promote excellence in research and education, to integrate basic and clinical science in the field of bone and mineral metabolism, and to facilitate the translation of research into clinical practice and the betterment of human health. Chairs and members of committees, task forces, and editorial boards must assure that they act in these roles in a manner free from commercial bias and that they resolve any conflict or duality of interest or disclose them and then recuse themselves from related deliberations and voting. A table providing a summary of disclosures from each task force member is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>ASBMR Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that the Society adheres to the highest ethical practices, ASBMR has an ethics committee, consults with experts in health care ethics, and periodically reviews its practices with regard to managing potential conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Although task force members were required to disclose their potential conflicts of interest and their disclosures are published with this document, ASBMR recognizes that this might not go far enough to demonstrate to some that the final output of the task force is free of all bias. In an effort to address this concern, an ethicist knowledgeable about the musculoskeletal system who does not work directly on bone or bisphosphonates (BPs) or with pharmaceutical companies who make or market BPs is a member of the task force and provided ethical oversight to the work of the task force. The ethicist has verified and attested to witness no commercial bias.</p></div>"/>
