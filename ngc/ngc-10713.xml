	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong, <span>conditional</span></strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low or very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Risk Factors Associated with the Development of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-minimal (Grade &amp;ge;A2) Acute Cellular Rejection and Lymphocytic Bronchiolitis</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who have non-minimal acute cellular rejection (Grade &amp;ge;A2) or lymphocytic bronchiolitis on transbronchial lung biopsy specimens, the Committee suggests augmented immunosuppression with a course of systemic steroids to prevent the development of BOS (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a high value on preventing a life-threatening complication of lung transplantation and a lower value on avoiding short-term adverse effects.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>A typical course of systemic corticosteroids used to augment immunosuppression in adult recipients is intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days (many centres use 10-15 mg&amp;middot;kg<sup>-1</sup> per day for smaller patients).</p>
<p><strong>Minimal (Grade A1) Acute Cellular Rejection</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who have clinically significant minimal acute cellular rejection (Grade A1) on transbronchial lung biopsy specimens, the Committee suggests augmented immunosuppression with a course of systemic steroids to prevent the development of BOS (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a high value on preventing a life-threatening complication of lung transplantation and a lower value on avoiding short-term side-effects.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>The Committee members consider Grade A1 acute cellular rejection to be clinically significant if it is associated with clinical findings, such as symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea, fatigue or new-onset cough) or objective measurements (e.g., decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] or oxyhaemoglobin desaturation with ambulation), that suggest the presence of allograft dysfunction. A typical course of systemic steroids used to augment immunosuppression in adult recipients is intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days (many centres use 10&amp;ndash;15 mg&amp;middot;kg<sup>-1</sup> per day for smaller patients).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment and Prevention of BOS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Long-Term High-Dose Corticosteroids</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who develop a decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> consistent with the onset of BOS, the Committee suggests that clinicians do not use long-term, high-dose corticosteroids (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a high value on avoiding harmful effects due to ineffective therapies.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>The Committee defines sustained administration of high-dose corticosteroid as &amp;ge;30 mg&amp;middot;day<sup>-1</sup> of prednisone or an equivalent formulation.</p>
<p><strong>Converting Cyclosporine to Tacrolimus</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who develop BOS while receiving chronic immunosuppression with a regimen that includes cyclosporine, the Committee suggests switching the cyclosporine to tacrolimus (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a higher value on mitigation of lung function decline and a lower value on avoiding nephrotoxicity and hyperglycaemia.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>The conversion of cyclosporine to tacrolimus is generally performed by stopping cyclosporine and initiating tacrolimus while transiently increasing maintenance corticosteroid dosing until tacrolimus blood levels are ascertained to have reached the desired target range. The target for therapeutic trough blood levels of tacrolimus is generally considered to range from 5 to 15 ng&amp;middot;mL<sup>-1</sup> for patients who are &amp;ge;18 years of age once a steady state has been attained.</p>
<p><strong>Azithromycin</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who develop a decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> consistent with the onset of BOS, the Committee suggests a trial of azithromycin (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a high value on preventing lung function deterioration and possibly reducing mortality, and a lower value on avoiding adverse effects.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>Azithromycin is generally administered orally at 250 mg per day for 5 days and then 250 mg three times per week. The Committee defines a trial of azithromycin as treating continuously with azithromycin for a minimum of 3 months. Additionally, it is unclear 1) whether azithromycin should be continued long-term if a beneficial response is observed, or 2) whether it should be discontinued if lung function does not show improvement during follow-up clinical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-reflux Surgery</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who develop a decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> consistent with the onset of BOS and have confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), the Committee suggests referral to an experienced surgeon to be evaluated for potential fundoplication of the gastro-oesophageal junction (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a high value on reducing the risk of lung function deterioration and possibly mortality, and a lower value on avoiding surgical complications.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>Nissen fundoplication has been more extensively studied than Toupet fundoplication; however, the Committee has no reason to believe that one is superior to the other and feels that the choice of the surgical technique should remain at the surgeon's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Re-transplantation</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em></p>
<p>For lung transplant recipients who have developed end-stage BOS refractory to other therapies, the Committee suggests referral to a transplant surgeon to be evaluated for re-transplantation (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em></p>
<p>This recommendation places a high value on avoiding surgical complications (e.g., mortality), recurrent BOS and resource utilisation.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em></p>
<p>The selection process for re-transplantation is the same as that used for first-time lung transplantation.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>An International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) sponsored <em>ad hoc</em> committee held preliminary meetings in April and May of 2008 to begin the process of identifying and prioritising topics to be covered in this guideline. The chairs were approved by the three societies. Panel members were identified as leaders in the field of lung transplantation and were selected from established transplant centres worldwide, by the chairs, to review the existing literature and to answer clinical questions based upon the published evidence or, when such evidence was lacking, to provide guidance based upon the observations in their clinical practice. Each member of the committee was involved in developing the conclusions and recommendations provided by this document.</p>
<p>Members of the committee were provided with the entire collection of compiled documents and subcommittees were formed to address specific topics. Each subcommittee reviewed, appraised and summarised the relevant evidence. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to appraise the quality of the body of evidence supporting each recommendation. Clinical questions related to treatment versus no treatment, one treatment versus an alternative treatment, or which populations to treat were answered with recommendations that were formulated and graded using the GRADE approach (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; fields). Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. The final recommendations and grades were reviewed by the entire committee and approved in September 2013. In contrast to the systematically developed recommendations, other committee conclusions were based upon the literature appraisal and committee deliberations.</p>
<p>A strong recommendation was made if the committee felt confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences. A conditional recommendation was made if the committee felt less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences. Factors that influence the strength of recommendations include the estimates of effect for desirable and undesirable outcomes of interest, confidence in these estimates of effects, estimates of values and preferences, and resource use. In any case the appropriate course of action depends upon the clinical context. The committees' judgments about the underlying values and preferences of well-informed patients were based upon the committee members' clinical experience. Evidence tables summarising the relevant literature for each recommendation are provided in the online supplementary material (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The committee identified very few experimental studies of the management of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Available data are very limited owing to the small number of subjects. Thus, most of the recommendations are based upon observational studies with or without a control group and the clinical experience of the committee members (i.e., unsystematic clinical observations from their clinical practices).</p></div>"/>

    <li>When deciding whether or not augmented immunosuppression is warranted, the likelihood of preventing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) must be balanced against the harms of the increased immunosuppression. This balance will vary depending upon the regimen chosen; however, a short course of systemic steroids is the most common regimen selected. The best evidence regarding the potential adverse effects of a short course of systemic steroids is indirect, extrapolated from randomised trials conducted in patients having an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such trials have found that short courses of systemic steroids increase the incidence of adverse effects, particularly hyperglycaemia and weight gain. </li>
    <li>Sustained high-dose corticosteroids increase the incidence of osteoporotic fractures, cataracts and dyspepsia. </li>
    <li>The most common adverse effects of azithromycin are nausea, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and colitis, occurring in fewer than 5% of patients. A meta-analysis of 12 randomised trials with 1406 patients who received azithromycin to treat an acute lower respiratory tract infection found that 244 (17.9%) out of 1363 patients developed an adverse event. Most of the adverse events were minor nausea and diarrhoea. In an observational study that looked at more than one million instances of taking azithromycin, patients who took azithromycin were more likely to suffer a fatal cardiac arrhythmia than those who did not take an antibiotic (risk ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13&amp;ndash;7.24). The absolute risk of a fatal cardiac arrhythmia during azithromycin therapy was small (1.1 cases per 1000 person-years) and the risk was not increased compared with patients who took an alternative antibiotic (risk ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56&amp;ndash;1.55). These findings were supported by another study conducted by the maker of azithromycin. There is also evidence from a randomised trial that patients with COPD who are treated with chronic azithromycin therapy are more likely to experience a decrement in hearing and colonisation with azithromycin-resistant organisms. </li>
    <li>Several studies reported a complication rate of less than 5% of patients after anti-reflux surgery, a perioperative mortality rate of less than 1%, and post-operative dysphagia in 6% to 14% of patients. </li>
    <li>Most of the case series that described the effects of converting cyclosporine to tacrolimus in lung transplant patients with BOS did not mention adverse effects; however, those that evaluated nephrotoxicity or hyperglycaemia reported a frequent rise in the serum creatinine and glucose levels. </li>
    <li>The safety of re-transplantation has not been well studied. In one study, there were 39 (10%) deaths within 180 days among the 389 patients who underwent re-transplantation. The causes of death were infection, respiratory failure and multi-organ system failure. Patients undergoing re-transplantation had an increased risk for death after the procedure compared with patients who underwent primary transplantation. </li>
