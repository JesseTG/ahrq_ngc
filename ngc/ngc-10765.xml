	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In adults treated with chemotherapy for a solid tumor or lymphoma, what factors should clinicians consider when selecting patients for primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia with a colony-stimulating factor (CSF)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em>: Primary prophylaxis with a CSF starting in the first cycle and continuing through subsequent cycles of chemotherapy is recommended in patients who have an approximately 20% or higher risk for febrile neutropenia on the basis of patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors. Primary CSF prophylaxis should also be administered in patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy when considered appropriate. Consideration should be given to alternative, equally effective, and safe chemotherapy regimens not requiring CSF support when available. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Among adults treated with chemotherapy for a solid tumor or lymphoma, what factors should clinicians use to select patients for secondary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia with a CSF?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2</em>: Secondary prophylaxis with CSFs is recommended for patients who experienced a neutropenic complication from a previous cycle of chemotherapy (for which primary prophylaxis was not received), in which a reduced dose or treatment delay may compromise disease free or overall survival (OS) or treatment outcome. In many clinical situations, dose reduction or delay may be a reasonable alternative. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there circumstances in which CSFs should be considered for the treatment of neutropenia in adults with cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Therapy for Patients with Afebrile Neutropenia</span></p>
<p>CSFs should not be routinely used for patients with neutropenia who are afebrile. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Therapy for Febrile Patients with Neutropenia</span></p>
<p>CSFs should not be routinely used as adjunctive treatment with antibiotic therapy for patients with fever and neutropenia. However, CSFs should be considered in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated complications or who have prognostic factors that are predictive of poor clinical outcomes. High-risk features include expected prolonged (&amp;gt;10 days) and profound (&amp;lt;0.1 X 10<sup>9</sup>/L) neutropenia, age &amp;gt;65 years, uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia, hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction (sepsis syndrome), invasive fungal infection, or hospitalization at the time of fever development. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 4 </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In what settings should CSFs be used to increase chemotherapy dose density?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em>: Dose-dense regimens with CSF support should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Efficacy data support the use of CSFs with dose-dense chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of high-risk breast cancer and with high&amp;ndash;dose-intensity methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (HD-M-VAC) in urothelial cancer. There are limited and conflicting data on the value of dose-dense regimens with CSF support in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and this cannot routinely be recommended at this time. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high for breast cancer and lymphoma, intermediate for urothelial cancer; Strength of recommendation: strong for breast cancer and lymphoma, moderate for urothelial cancer)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of CSFs as adjuncts to progenitor-cell transplantation?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: CSFs may be used alone, after chemotherapy, or in combination with plerixafor to mobilize peripheral-blood progenitor cells. Choice of mobilization strategy depends in part on type of cancer and type of transplantation. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: strong; Strength of recommendation: high)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2</em>: CSFs should be administered after autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT) to reduce the duration of severe neutropenia. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.3</em>: CSFs may be administered after allogeneic SCT to reduce the duration of severe neutropenia. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of CSFs in the setting of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6</em>: The Update Committee did not provide recommendations regarding the use of CSFs in adults with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should CSFs be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em>: CSFs should be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, particularly involving the mediastinum. In the absence of chemotherapy, therapeutic use of CSFs may be considered in patients receiving radiation therapy alone if prolonged delays secondary to neutropenia are expected. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there CSF recommendations that apply specifically to older adults and that differ from recommendations in younger adults?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8</em>: Prophylactic CSFs for patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma age &amp;ge;65 years treated with curative chemotherapy (CHOP-R) should be considered, particularly in the presence of comorbidities. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How should CSFs be used in the pediatric population?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.1</em>: The use of CSFs in pediatric patients will almost always be guided by clinical protocols. As in adults, a CSF is reasonable as the primary prophylaxis for pediatric patients with a high likelihood of febrile neutropenia. Similarly, a CSF as secondary prophylaxis or therapy should be limited to high-risk patients. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.2</em>: For pediatric indications in which dose-intense chemotherapy is known to have a survival benefit, such as Ewing sarcoma, CSFs should be used to enable the administration of these regimens. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.3</em>: CSFs should not be used in pediatric patients with nonrelapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or nonrelapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who do not have an infection. (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 10</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are recommendations for the initiation, duration, dosing, and administration of CSFs?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em>: Recommendations for the administration of filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, pegfilgrastim, and sargramostim are summarized in Table 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 11</span></strong>
<p><strong>Do CSFs differ in efficacy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 11</em>: Pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, and filgrastim-sndz (and other biosimilars as they become available) can be used for the prevention of treatment-related febrile neutropenia. The choice of agent depends on convenience, cost, and clinical situation. There have been no additional data comparing G-CSF and GM-CSF since the 2006 update; therefore, there has been no change in the recommendation regarding their therapeutic equivalency. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 12</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of CSFs in the treatment of radiation injury?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 12</em>: Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total-body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death as a result of injury to other organs, include the prompt administration of CSFs or pegylated G-CSFs. (Type: formal consensus [by others], benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, pediatric oncology, community oncology, epidemiology and biostatistics, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Committee was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee met twice via webinar and corresponded frequently through e-mail. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Update Committee participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> for peer review and consideration for publication. All ASCO guidelines are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee prior to publication.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software<sup>TM</sup>. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>

    <field fieldid="148" ordby="565" id="417" name="Cost Analysis" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cost Implications</span></strong></p>
<p>Although the 2006 Update Committee extensively discussed the cost of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), it recommended CSF use when the febrile neutropenia rate was approximately &amp;ge;20% based on clinical impact alone, because of the consensus that reduction in febrile neutropenia itself was an important clinical outcome. Since the 2006 update, original data from randomized trials have been limited.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analyses of primary versus secondary prophylaxis with granulocyte CSFs (G-CSFs) have produced varying results. In a model that considered three different strategies (no primary prophylaxis, 10 days of filgrastim, or one dose of pegfilgrastim) among patients receiving a 21-day cycle of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone or prednisone (R-CHOP-21) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary prophylaxis was not cost effective from the perspective of a publicly funded health care system. Costs associated with no primary prophylaxis, filgrastim prophylaxis, and pegfilgrastim prophylaxis were Canadian $7,314, $13,947, and $16,290, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness for primary prophylaxis with filgrastim versus no primary prophylaxis was Canadian $5,796,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, far outside accepted bounds. In a United Kingdom&amp;ndash;based model of cost among patients with breast cancer, the most cost effective strategy (primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, or no G-CSFs) depended on patient characteristics and risk of febrile neutropenia. Of the three types of G-CSFs evaluated, pegfilgrastim seemed to be more cost effective than filgrastim or lenograstim. A cost benefit may be more apparent in the United States, as a result of higher health care costs, but cost effectiveness will vary by factors such as the risk of febrile neutropenia.</p>
<p>Randomized trials have assessed the efficacy of reduced dosages or less frequent administration of prophylactic G-CSFs. A study in the United Kingdom randomly assigned 172 patients with breast cancer to primary prophylaxis with a G-CSF during all six cycles of chemotherapy or during just the first two cycles. Prophylactic G-CSF during only the first two cycles of chemotherapy was cost saving but resulted in a higher rate of febrile neutropenia than a G-CSF during all cycles (36% versus 10%, respectively). A reduced dose of lenograstim (50 &amp;micro;g/body) was evaluated in a small cross-over study of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in Japan and compared favorably with a 75-&amp;micro;g/ body dose of filgrastim. In the absence of more definitive data, the consensus of the 2015 Update Committee is that clinicians should adhere to current product labeling.</p>
<p>There do seem to be opportunities to improve G-CSF use in the community. The overuse of CSFs was one of the 2012 Americal Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Choosing Wisely recommendations: &quot;Don't use white cell stimulating factors for primary prevention of febrile neutropenia for patients with less than 20% risk for this complication.&quot; To reduce CSF use in patients receiving low-risk chemotherapy regimens, one study group instituted real-time peer-to-peer consultation regarding pegfilgrastim use. Among patients receiving low-risk chemotherapy regimens, pegfilgrastim use decreased from 52 units in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 15 units in the third quarter of 2010 (71% decrease) with no adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Although questions remain about the cost-effectiveness of G-CSFs in certain settings, the 2015 Update Committee has reiterated the position that G-CSF prophylaxis should be driven by clinical considerations and not by cost. CSF use is recommended when the febrile neutropenia rate is &amp;ge;20% based on clinical impact alone, because of the consensus that reduction in febrile neutropenia itself is an important clinical outcome. The 2015 Update Committee has recognized, again, that these are expensive agents with the potential for overuse. As stated, when alternative regimens are available that offer equivalent efficacy without the need for CSF support, these alternative regimens should be used.</p></div>"/>

    <li>For adults with a solid tumor or lymphoma who receive chemotherapy regimens that carry a high risk of febrile neutropenia (&amp;ge;20%), primary prophylaxis substantially reduces the risk of a serious treatment complication and is recommended for most patients. However, for many commonly used chemotherapy regimens, the risk of febrile neutropenia is &amp;lt;20%, and more individualized decisions about colony-stimulating factor (CSF) use are required. The risk of neutropenic complications and the importance of primary prophylaxis will vary with factors such as age, comorbidity, and other treatment-related considerations. It is important that in addition to understanding the evidence-based benefits and other risks of treatment, patients learn about the risk of febrile neutropenia as part of routine chemotherapy education. </li>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href=&quot;http://www.asco.org/&quot; title=&quot;ASCO Web site&quot;>ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
