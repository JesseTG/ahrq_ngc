	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Occupational lung disease is a broad category of disease entities characterized by a non-neoplastic reaction of the lung parenchyma to inhaled aerosolized particles found in the environment, typically from work-related exposure. The term &quot;pneumoconiosis&quot; refers to diseases associated with the inhalation of inorganic mineral dusts. This paper reviews the 3 most common inorganic occupational lung diseases: silicosis, coal worker pneumoconiosis, and asbestosis. The less common inorganic occupational lung diseases include, but are not limited to, berylliosis, talcosis, hard metal pneumoconiosis, and flavorings-related lung disease.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Imaging Modalities</strong></p>
<p>Chest radiography is one of the primary imaging modalities used to evaluate the pneumoconioses and has traditionally been performed by analog technique. The International Labor Organization (ILO) developed a well-recognized classification scheme for chest radiography to objectively classify lung opacities based on their size, shape, and profusion.</p>
<p>However, with evolution of modern imaging techniques such as digital radiography, analog radiography has largely been replaced. In 2011 the ILO updated its guidelines for evaluation of pneumoconiosis by extending the applicability of its classification scheme to digital radiography.</p>
<p>There is still no standardized scoring system available for high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), even though there is significant improvement of resolution and improved ability to detect more subtle abnormalities as compared to chest radiography. Despite this fact, HRCT is still a valuable tool for the evaluation of lungs in patients with this category of disease.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though known to be limited in detecting abnormalities in the predominantly air-filled lungs, may have a role in evaluation of some parenchymal and pleural abnormalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) also has a limited role for the evaluation of the occupational lung diseases, and its role in staging malignant mesothelioma is controversial. The specific imaging findings associated with occupational lung diseases are well described in the literature and are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Imaging Modalities by Variant</strong></p>
<p><em>Variant 1: Silica Exposure, Suspected Silicosis</em></p>
<p>Chest radiography and HRCT are the primary imaging modalities employed in the evaluation of silicosis. However, HRCT has been shown in the literature as being more sensitive for the detection of parenchymal findings associated with silica-related lung disease. A group of authors studied 90 patients exposed to silica in mine machinery manufacturing workers. They observed that the number of small opacities detected by HRCT scans were significantly higher than those seen in radiography in all lung zones. When these researchers compared radiography versus HRCT for the detection of complications of silicosis, there was a statistically significant increase in the detectability of bulla, emphysema, and pleural changes in addition to lymphadenopathy. Another group demonstrated that 10 of 26 patients who were determined to have simple silicosis on chest radiography were upgraded to complicated silicosis (progressive massive fibrosis [PMF]) at HRCT examination. Similarly, in another study, 13 of 32 individuals with a history of silica dust exposure and a normal chest radiograph demonstrated evidence of silicosis on HRCT.</p>
<p>Both severities of findings on chest radiography and HRCT correlate with a reduction in lung function in patients with silicosis. A group of authors studied 76 men with proven silicosis and demonstrated a linear relationship between the severity of both HRCT and chest radiography findings with respect to lung functional parameters. They determined that the severity of PMF had an inverse correlation with patients' pulmonary function tests. Furthermore, they determined that although both chest radiography and HRCT demonstrated an inverse relationship to all lung functional parameters, the strongest relationship was comparing HRCT findings of PMF and nodular profusion index to lung functional parameters. They conclude by suggesting that CT may be used to indirectly quantify functional impairment. Interestingly, another group of authors observed that small opacities on HRCT had no significant negative effect on lung function. However, large opacities were associated with a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. The inference is that the size of lung opacities correlates with severity of disease, a conclusion similar to that reached by the first group. Another study comparing HRCT to pulmonary function tests concluded that profusion of opacities on HRCT correlates with functional deterioration as well.</p>
<p>In another study, the authors used inspiratory and expiratory thin CT scans in 37 patients with silicosis and determined that air trapping was the best measure of assessment of obstructive disease in this population.</p>
<p><em>Variant 2: Coal Dust Exposure, Suspected Pneumoconiosis</em></p>
<p>Recent literature interrogation specifically on the data for imaging appropriateness of coal worker pneumoconiosis yielded few results. However, one article compared chest radiography with HRCT in patients with early and low-grade coal worker pneumoconiosis and questioned the utility of radiography in screening of these patients. Their study population included a final population of 67 patients with at least 10 years of exposure to coal dust and no history of pulmonary disease. They used the ILO grading schematic for chest radiography and the Hosoda-Shida Classification of CT for pneumoconiosis to categorize lung abnormalities. In addition to demonstrating improved sensitivity for detection of lung opacities by HRCT, the investigators also observed a high discordance rate between chest radiography and HRCT. In the study, 28 of 67 patients (42%) initially categorized with chest radiography were placed in a different category of lung abnormality after HRCT assessment. The authors conclude that HRCT should be used in the screening of this specific patient population because HRCT is more sensitive and better categorizes the lung abnormality as compared to chest radiography.</p>
<p>Recent advancements in imaging technology have led to the study of PMF using MRI. One study compared CT and MRI findings of 22 cases of histologically confirmed PMF in 20 coal miners and concluded that there is potential clinical use for MRI in evaluation of PMF lesions in pneumoconiosis. The investigators observed that all of the lesions detected on CT were identified on the MRI comparison study and MRI interpretations did not demonstrate false-positive or false-negative findings with respect to the presence of PMF on CT. The authors state MRI could be an alternative modality, particularly if minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation is of concern. They also state that additional studies are warranted to establish the clinical value of MRI in patients with various pulmonary diseases.</p>
<p>There are limited data on PET imaging of suspected lung cancer in patients with coal worker pneumoconiosis. However, one study observed 6 cases where PET was used in this specific setting. The authors observed the presence of 18 of 19 nodules that were hypermetabolic in the range typically seen with malignancy. However, none of these nodules were determined to be malignant, thus they concluded that PET imaging is of limited utility given the high false-positive rate.</p>
<p><em>Variants 3 and 4: Asbestos Exposure, Suspected Interstitial Lung Disease or Mesothelioma</em></p>
<p>Chest radiography is the primary method of screening for asbestos-related interstitial lung diseases; however, CT is more sensitive for the detection of lung abnormalities and complications related to asbestos exposure. A group of researchers studied 266 employees from an asbestos cement plant that used chrysotile exclusively. Chest radiography detected abnormal findings in approximately 21% of the employees, whereas HRCT detected 67%. Interestingly, the investigators observed that lung function correlated with parenchymal and visceral pleural abnormalities on HRCT. Another group studied chest CT screening in asbestos-exposed workers and observed 6 lung cancers, including 1 pleural mesothelioma, identified by CT, and only 1 cancer identified by chest radiography. The authors concluded that despite additional confounding findings, CT was better than radiography in detecting lung cancer in individuals exposed to asbestos. Although lacking a chest radiograph control group, another study assessed the prevalence of lung cancer using low-dose multidetector CT in a cohort of 187 asbestos-exposed high-risk patients. The investigators observed 8 lung malignancies in 187 individuals. In a ninth individual there was strong suspicion for lung malignancy, but that patient died before further workup. In an additional study, the authors demonstrated the progression of mild asbestos-related lung parenchymal abnormalities in 81% of patients after a 3-year to 5-year follow-up using HRCT.</p>
<p>A study performed by another group of authors demonstrated improved detection of pleural abnormalities by HRCT over chest radiography alone in a cohort of individuals exposed to vermiculite-containing asbestos. The authors detected pleural abnormalities by HRCT in nearly 28% of the individuals whose chest radiographs were indeterminate. Similarly, another group of investigators observed that chest radiography could not detect pleural plaques located in a paravertebral location, whereas CT was able to identify 89 paravertebral pleural plaques. Finally, another study evaluated the use of MRI in assessment of asbestos-related pleural abnormalities. The researchers observed a comparable interobserver agreement for the detection of pleural plaques and higher interobserver agreement in the detection of pleural thickening and pleural effusion than compared with CT. For the detection of mesothelioma, they found no significant difference between the kappa values for MRI and CT. Furthermore, an additional study suggested that apparent diffusion coefficient maps may be useful in discriminating different histological subtypes of malignant pleural mesothelioma and may complement other MRI sequences in the evaluation of mesothelioma as well.</p>
<p>A group of investigators studied a cohort of 31 patients with pleural disease related to asbestos exposure to determine the use of PET/CT in discriminating between benign pleural disease and malignant mesothelioma. The authors observed that PET/CT identified 15 of 17 cases of malignant mesothelioma based on metabolic activity. Thirteen of 14 benign pleural lesions were considered negative by PET/CT. Using a SUVmax threshold of 2.2, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94.1%, 100%, 100%, and 93.3% respectively. They concluded that PET/CT is useful for discriminating benign pleural disease from malignant mesothelioma.</p>
<p>Another group of authors retrospectively studied the use of PET/CT staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma in 20 patients undergoing trimodality therapy. They observed that PET/CT failed to identify advanced tumor stage and had a sensitivity of only 11% for the detection of mediastinal nodal disease. They concluded that the role for PET/CT is in excluding patients with metastatic disease outside the affected hemithorax prior to extrapleural pneumonectomy.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>

    <li>Workup of occupational lung diseases usually begins with routine chest radiography. However, the greater resolution of CT chest over chest radiography allows for more sensitive and accurate detection and characterization of lung and pleural abnormalities. </li>
    <li>CT chest without contrast suffices for routine analysis of patients with occupational lung disease in most scenarios. In some situations, utilizing contrast-enhanced CT chest may be of utility if there is a clinical question of pulmonary embolism and in assessing for adenopathy/masses. Rarely is there a need for performing CT chest without and with contrast. </li>
    <li>Fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) may have utility in patients with suspected mesothelioma in terms of defining mediastinal and distal metastatic disease and perhaps localizing a potential biopsy site. Otherwise, the role of FDG-PET is limited. </li>
    <li>In general, MRI is not regarded as appropriate in the evaluation of occupational lung diseases. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness. When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.</p>
<p>The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category &quot;usually not appropriate&quot; where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category &quot;usually appropriate&quot; where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated &quot;may be appropriate,&quot; is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.</p>
<p>The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is &quot;May be appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the <a href=&quot;http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>Rating Round Information</a> document on the ACR Web site.</p>

<p><strong>Relative Radiation Level</strong></p>
<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria&amp;reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination.</p></div>"/>
