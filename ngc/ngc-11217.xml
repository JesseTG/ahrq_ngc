	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>American Cancer Society (ACS) Recommendations for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) Survivorship Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Surveillance for HNC Recurrence</strong></p>
<p><em>History and Physical</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 1.1. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should individualize clinical follow-up care provided to HNC survivors based on age, specific diagnosis, and treatment protocol as recommended by the treating oncology team (<strong>LOE = 2A</strong>); b) should conduct a detailed cancer-related history and physical examination every 1 to 3 months for the first year after primary treatment, every 2 to 6 months in the second year, every 4 to 8 months in years 3 to 5, and annually after 5 years (<strong>LOE = 2A</strong>) (Pfister et al., 2015); c) should confirm continued follow-up with otolaryngologist or HNC specialist for head and neck (HN)-focused examination (<strong>LOE = 2A</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Surveillance Education</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 1.2. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should educate and counsel all HNC survivors about the signs and symptoms of local recurrence. (<strong>LOE = 0</strong>); b) should refer HNC survivors to an HNC specialist if signs and symptoms of local recurrence are present (<strong>LOE = 0</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Screening and Early Detection of Second Primary Cancers (SPCs)</strong></p>
<p>Recommendation 2.1. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should screen HNC survivors for other cancers as they would for patients in the general population by adhering to the ACS Early Detection Recommendations (<a href=&quot;https://cancer.org/professionals&quot; title=&quot;ACS Web site&quot;>cancer.org/professionals</a><strong>; LOE = 0</strong>); b) should screen HNC survivors for lung cancer according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) or National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (Wood et al., 2016) recommendations for annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for high-risk patients based on smoking history (<strong>LOE = 2A</strong>); c) should screen HNC survivors for another HN and esophageal cancer as they would for patients of increased risk (<strong>LOE = 0, IIA</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Management of Physical and Psychosocial Long-term and Late Effects of HNC and Its Treatment </strong></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.1. It is recommended that primary care clinicians should assess for long-term and late effects of HNC and its treatment at each follow-up visit (<strong>LOE = 0</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Spinal Accessory Nerve (SAN) Palsy</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.2. It is recommended that primary care clinicians should refer HNC survivors with spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy occurring post-radical neck dissection to a rehabilitation specialist to improve range of motion and ability to perform daily tasks (<strong>LOE = IA</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Cervical Dystonia/Muscle Spasms/Neuropathies</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.3. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should assess HNC survivors for cervical dystonia, which is characterized by painful dystonic spasms of the cervical muscles and can be caused by neck dissection, radiation, or both (<strong>LOE = 0</strong>); b) should refer HNC survivors to a rehabilitation specialist for comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal management if cervical dystonia or neuropathy is found (<strong>LOE = 0</strong>); c) should prescribe nerve-stabilizing agents, such as pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine, or refer to a specialist for botulinum toxin type A injections into the affected muscles for pain management and spasm control as indicated (<strong>LOE = 0, IIA</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Shoulder Dysfunction</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.4. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should conduct baseline assessment of HNC survivor shoulder function posttreatment for strength, range of motion, and impingement signs, and continue to assess as follow-up for ongoing complications or worsening condition (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); b) should refer HNC survivors to a rehabilitation specialist for improvement to pain, disability, and range of motion where shoulder morbidity exists (<strong>LOE = IA</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Trismus</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.5. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should refer HNC survivors to rehabilitation specialists and dental professionals to prevent trismus and to treat trismus as soon as it is diagnosed (<strong>LOE = 0</strong>); b) should prescribe nerve-stabilizing agents to combat pain and spasms, which may also ease physical therapy and stretching devices (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Dysphagia/Aspiration/Stricture</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.6. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should refer HNC survivors presenting with complaints of dysphagia, postprandial cough, unexplained weight loss, and/or pneumonia to an experienced speech-language pathologist for instrumental evaluation of swallowing function to assess and manage dysphagia and possible aspiration (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); b) should recognize potential for psychosocial barriers to swallowing recovery and refer HNC survivors to an appropriate clinician if barriers are present (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); c) should refer to a speech-language pathologist for videofluoroscopy as the first-line test for HNC survivors with suspected stricture due to the high degree of coexisting physiologic dysphagia (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); d) should refer HNC survivors with stricture to a gastroenterologist or HN surgeon for esophageal dilation (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</em></p>
<p>Recommendation 3.7. It is recommended that primary care clinicians: a) should monitor HNC survivors for developing or worsening GERD, as it prevents healing of irradiated tissues and is associated with increased risk of HNC recurrence or SPCs (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); b) should counsel HNC survivors on an increased risk of esophageal cancer and the associated symptoms (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); c) should recommend proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or antacids, sleeping with a wedge pillow or 3-inch blocks under the head of the bed, not eating or drinking fluids for 3 hours before bedtime, tobacco cessation, and avoidance of alcohol (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>); d) should refer HNC survivors to a gastroenterologist if symptoms are not relieved by treatments listed in 3.7c (<strong>LOE = IIA</strong>).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature review began with an environmental scan of existing guidelines and guidance developed by other organizations (e.g., the National Comprehensive Cancer Network<sup>&amp;reg;</sup> [NCCN<sup>&amp;reg;</sup>], ASCO), specific medical centers (e.g., The University of Texas MD Anderson Clinical Tools and Resources Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship algorithm, US Preventive Services Task Force), and those available from other countries (e.g., Australian Cancer Survivorship Centre).</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed for 2004 through April 2015. Studies on childhood cancers, qualitative studies, and non-English publications were excluded. Also excluded were studies that consisted of entirely non-North American populations, because head and neck cancer (HNC) prevalence is higher in some countries due to lifestyle causes and differing etiology. Search terms included: cancer survivor AND review OR meta-analysis OR systematic review OR guidelines; guidance AND head and neck cancer OR head and neck cancer survivor; head and neck cancer patient post-treatment AND symptom management OR late effects OR long-term effects OR psychosocial care OR palliative care OR health promotion OR surveillance OR screening for new cancers OR self-management OR guidelines OR guidance OR follow up OR follow-up OR side effects OR (chemotherapy AND side effects) OR (radiation AND side effects), OR surgery OR treatment complications OR genetic counseling and testing OR survivor or patient interventions OR provider interventions OR provider education OR barriers. Additional search attempts included head and neck cancer OR head and neck cancer survivor OR head and neck cancer patient post-treatment AND (symptom-specific terms, such as swallowing, body image, neck dissection, etc.).</p>
<p>The highest priority was given to articles that met the following criteria: peer-reviewed publication in English since 2004 unless a seminal article published before that date still carried the most weight, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and population-based case-control studies; studies of more than 50 cancer cases analyzed and with high-quality assessment of covariates and analytic methods; and analyses controlled for important confounders (e.g., preexisting comorbid conditions).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Methods used to develop this guideline were influenced by the American Cancer Society (ACS) cancer screening and survivorship care guidelines. Where appropriate, this guideline builds upon the recently published American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) symptom-based guidelines for adult cancer survivors. ASCO has symptom-based guidelines specific to fatigue, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Panel Formation</span></strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was formed and tasked with drafting the ACS Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. Workgroup members had expertise in primary care, dentistry, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, clinical psychology, speech language pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and nursing. In addition, a head and neck cancer (HNC) cancer survivor was included to provide a patient perspective.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Results</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Clinical interpretation of the included evidence follows each recommendation, along with a rating of the level of evidence (LOE) supporting each recommendation. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature, but most evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong, evidence-based recommendation. Rather, recommendations should be largely viewed as possible management strategies given the current evidence base and the logistical challenges of comprehensively adhering to these recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>The clinical practice guideline published herein is provided by the American Cancer Society (ACS) to assist providers in clinical decision making. This information should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.</p>
<p>This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. The use of words like &quot;must,&quot; &quot;must not,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. The ACS provides this information on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and makes no warranty, express or suggested, regarding the information. The ACS specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. The ACS assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>A significant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence base to provide clear and specific recommendations for the prevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer survivors. There are few prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing interventions among head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. The majority of the citations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects and management recommendations rely predominantly on case-control studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that combine studies with various outcome measures. There were several cohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of late effects.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ACS health systems network. The ACS guidelines are posted on the ACS Web site at <a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/professionals&quot; title=&quot;ACS Web site&quot;>cancer.org/professionals</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>More Resources</span></strong></p>
<p>In addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist primary care clinicians in implementing these recommendations. <em>CA</em> offers a Patient Page (<a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.3322/caac.21344/&quot; title=&quot;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Web site&quot;>onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.3322/caac.21344/</a>) to help patients understand how to use this guideline to talk to the primary care clinician about surveillance and screening, symptom management, healthy behaviors, and care coordination. <em>CA</em> also offers free continuing medical education and free continuing nursing education for this article at <a href=&quot;http://www.acsjournals.com/ce&quot; title=&quot;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Web site&quot;>acsjournals.com/ce</a> as an additional resource for physicians and nurses. The Survivorship Center also offers The George Washington University Cancer Institute's Cancer Survivorship E-Learning Series for Primary Care Providers (The E-Learning Series), a free, innovative, online, continuing-education program to educate primary care clinicians about how to better understand and care for survivors in the primary care setting. Continuing education credits are available at no cost to physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and physician assistants for each 1-hour module.
