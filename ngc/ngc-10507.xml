	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the strength of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low, or insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>strong, weak</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: <em>American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends a sleep study for patients with unexplained daytime sleepiness</em>. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should target their assessment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to individuals with unexplained daytime sleepiness. This assessment should include evaluation of the risk factors and common presenting symptoms for OSA. The best documented risk factor for OSA is obesity. Clinical symptoms for OSA include unintentional sleep episodes during wakefulness, daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, insomnia, and snoring. If other causes have been ruled out (for example, thyroid disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or other respiratory diseases), further evaluation for OSA may be warranted in patients with daytime sleepiness, which is the clinically relevant OSA symptom most responsive to treatment. Evidence is lacking on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on improving other outcomes, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease events, and mortality, especially among individuals without daytime sleepiness. For guidance on treatment, clinicians should refer to the ACP guideline on management of OSA. Sleepiness questionnaires, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), help in assessing the symptom severity of OSA but cannot assess the apnea&amp;ndash;hypopnea index (AHI) (a necessary but not sufficient component of OSA) and lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to replace a sleep study in diagnosing OSA.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: <em>ACP recommends polysomnography (PSG) for diagnostic testing in patients suspected of OSA. ACP recommends portable sleep monitors in patients without serious comorbidities as an alternative to PSG when PSG is not available for diagnostic testing.</em> (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Full-night, attended, in-laboratory PSG is considered the reference standard diagnostic test and is recommended in patients with suspected OSA. However, in the absence of PSG, portable monitors may be used as an alternative diagnostic test in such patients. Both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services consider an AHI score of at least 15 events per hour or at least 5 events per hour with symptoms (such as daytime somnolence and fatigue) as criteria for OSA diagnosis. Evidence shows that compared with PSG, type II, III, and IV monitors have a wide range of difference in AHI estimates. These monitors have a high positive likelihood ratio and low negative likelihood ratio for various AHI cutoff levels to predict OSA. Monitors with more channels perform better than those with fewer channels, and type IV monitors have an important limitation in that they are unable to distinguish obstructive from central sleep apnea. There is no direct evidence from head-to-head comparisons of type III and IV monitors, but indirect evidence from studies comparing each monitor with PSG suggested that type III monitors performed better than type IV monitors in predicting AHI scores suggestive of OSA. Although portable monitors may be useful, data loss of 3% to 20% has been reported for type III and IV monitors. Furthermore, inadequate data resulting in limited interpretation of results from the use of type III monitors has been reported for 13% to 20% of the evaluations. The utility of portable monitors for patients with serious comorbid conditions, including chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, or neurologic disorders, has not been verified.</p>
<p>Evidence from studies comparing one monitor with another is lacking. The Figure in the original guideline document summarizes the recommendations and clinical considerations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p>

The evidence review was updated through 30 May 2013 by identifying literature in MEDLINE with the same search strategy and inclusion and exclusion criteria as the 2010 report (see the Supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The included studies reported minimum apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) thresholds for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis ranging from 5 to 20 events per hour. Further details about the methods and inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in the evidence review are available in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report and the Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Initial search strategy yielded a total of 2,435 articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for each AHRQ question were derived from the original AHRQ report. A careful review of titles and abstracts eliminated 1,728 articles. A review of full reports by one investigator (J.C.H.) excluded 622 studies.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Study Quality</strong></p>
<p>Methodological criteria for study quality were adapted from those proposed by Kent et al., to identify high-quality studies of the diagnosis for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (see Figure 4 in the Supplement) and utilized for Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Questions 1 and 2. The revised criteria cover seven assessment categories: technical quality of index test, technical quality of the reference test, application of the reference test, independence of interpretations, clinical description, cohort assembly and sample size.</p>
<p><strong>Data Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>One investigator abstracted primary data regarding patient characteristics and test diagnostics (e.g. sensitivity and/or specificity).</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis and Sensitivity/Specificity Calculations</strong></p>
<p>The investigators constructed 2 x 2 contingency tables for each study to summarize the results of the index test and the reference test(s). For each study, the true positive rate (TPR; sensitivity), the false-positive rate (FPR; 1-specificity), the diagnostic odds ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic accuracy ([TP+TN]/N) and the kappa-1 statistic were calculated. The investigators calculated a weighted kappa-1 coefficient (a generalization of the unweighted or Cohen's kappa coefficient) to assess accuracy with regards to avoiding false negative results. Calculation of the kappa-1 coefficient does not require the false positive rate (1-specificity), but does require knowledge of the marginal probabilities. Weighted kappa coefficient values close to one suggest good test accuracy, while values less than 0.40 suggest only fair to poor test accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Models</strong></p>
<p>All biostatistical models were programmed in Excel 8.0 for Windows (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). A normal approximation to the binomial of the standard error was used in calculating all other CI's, as appropriate. When making comparisons between groups of studies we used an unpaired t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. A two-tailed p-value &amp;lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></div>"/>

    <li>How do different available tests compare in their ability to diagnose sleep apnea in adults with symptoms suggestive of disordered sleep?

    <li>How does phased testing (screening tests or battery followed by full test) compare with full testing alone? </li>
    <li>What is the effect of preoperative screening for OSA on surgical outcomes? </li>
    <li>In adults being screened for OSA, what is the relationship between the apnea&amp;ndash;hypopnea index (AHI) and other patient characteristics with respect to long-term clinical and functional outcomes? </li>
