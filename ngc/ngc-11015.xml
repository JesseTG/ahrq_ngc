	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should obtain a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan on patients prior to performing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may obtain a non-contrast CT scan to help select the best candidate for shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL) versus ureteroscopy (URS). (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may obtain a functional imaging study (diethylenetriamine-pentacetic acid [DTPA] or (mercaptoacetyltriglycine [MAG‐3]) if clinically significant loss of renal function in the involved kidney or kidneys is suspected. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians are required to obtain a urinalysis prior to intervention. In patients with clinical or laboratory signs of infection, urine culture should be obtained. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count on patients undergoing procedures where there is a significant risk of hemorrhage or for patients with symptoms suggesting anemia, thrombocytopenia, or infection; serum electrolytes and creatinine should be obtained if there is suspicion of reduced renal function. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with complex stones or anatomy, clinicians may obtain additional contrast imaging if further definition of the collecting system and the ureteral anatomy is needed. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment of Adult Patients with Ureteral Stones</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients with uncomplicated ureteral stones &amp;le;10 mm should be offered observation, and those with distal stones of similar size should be offered medical expulsive therapy (MET) with &amp;alpha;-blockers. (<strong>Index Patient 3</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer reimaging to patients prior to surgery if passage of stones is suspected or if stone movement will change management. Reimaging should focus on the region of interest and limit radiation exposure to uninvolved regions. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In most patients, if observation with or without MET is not successful after four to six weeks and/or the patient/clinician decide to intervene sooner based on a shared decision making approach, clinicians should offer definitive stone treatment. (<strong>Index Patients 1-3</strong>) (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should inform patients that SWL is the procedure with the least morbidity and lowest complication rate, but URS has a greater stone-free rate in a single procedure. (<strong>Index Patients 1-6</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with mid or distal ureteral stones who require intervention (who were not candidates for or who failed MET), clinicians should recommend URS as first-line therapy. For patients who decline URS, clinicians should offer SWL. (<strong>Index Patients 2,3,5,6</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>URS is recommended for patients with suspected cystine or uric acid ureteral stones who fail MET or desire intervention. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Routine stenting should not be performed in patients undergoing SWL. (<strong>Index Patients 1-6</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Following URS, clinicians may omit ureteral stenting in patients meeting all of the following criteria: those without suspected ureteric injury during URS, those without evidence of ureteral stricture or other anatomical impediments to stone fragment clearance, those with a normal contralateral kidney, those without renal functional impairment, and those in whom a secondary URS procedure is not planned. (<strong>Index Patients 1-6</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade A</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Placement of a ureteral stent prior to URS should not be performed routinely. (<strong>Index Patient 1-6</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer &amp;alpha;-blockers and antimuscarinic therapy to reduce stent discomfort. (<strong>Index patients 1-6</strong>) (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients who fail or are unlikely to have successful results with SWL and/or URS, clinicians may offer PCNL, laparoscopic, open, or robotic assisted stone removal. (<strong>Index patient 1-6</strong>) (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians performing URS for proximal ureteral stones should have a flexible ureteroscope available. (<strong>Index Patients 1, 4</strong>) (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not utilize electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) as the first-line modality for intra-ureteral lithotripsy. (<strong>Index patients 1-6,13,15</strong>) (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with obstructing stones and suspected infection, clinicians must urgently drain the collecting system with a stent or nephrostomy tube and delay stone treatment. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In symptomatic patients with a total non-lower pole renal stone burden &amp;le;20 mm, clinicians may offer SWL or URS. (<strong>Index Patient 7</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In symptomatic patients with a total renal stone burden &amp;gt;20 mm, clinicians should offer PCNL as first-line therapy. (<strong>Index Patient 8</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with total renal stone burden &amp;gt;20 mm, clinicians should not offer SWL as first-line therapy. (<strong>Index Patient 8</strong>) (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may perform nephrectomy when the involved kidney has negligible function in patients requiring treatment. (<strong>Index Patients 1-14</strong>) (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with symptomatic (flank pain), non-obstructing, caliceal stones without another obvious etiology for pain, clinicians may offer stone treatment. (<strong>Index Patient 12</strong>) (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with asymptomatic, non-obstructing caliceal stones, clinicians may offer active surveillance. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer SWL or URS to patients with symptomatic &amp;le;10 mm lower pole renal stones. (<strong>Index Patient 9</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not offer SWL as first-line therapy to patients with &amp;gt;10 mm lower pole stones. (<strong>Index Patient 10</strong>) (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should inform patients with lower pole stones &amp;gt;10 mm in size that PCNL has a higher stone-free rate but greater morbidity. (<strong>Index Patient 10</strong>). (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing uncomplicated PCNL who are presumed stone-free, placement of a nephrostomy tube is optional. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Flexible nephroscopy should be a routine part of standard PCNL. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians must use normal saline irrigation for PCNL and URS. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients not considered candidates for PCNL, clinicians may offer staged URS. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may prescribe &amp;alpha;-blockers to facilitate passage of stone fragments following SWL. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>SWL should not be used in the patient with anatomic or functional obstruction of the collecting system or ureter distal to the stone. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with symptomatic caliceal diverticular stones, endoscopic therapy (URS, PCNL, laparoscopic, robotic) should be preferentially utilized. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C</em></strong>) </li>

<p><strong>Process for Initial Literature Selection</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the published American Urological Association (AUA) Guideline methodology framework, the process started by conducting a comprehensive systematic review. The AUA commissioned an independent group to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature on various options for the surgical management of stones. The protocol of the systematic review was developed <em>a priori</em> by the methodology team in conjunction with the expert panel. A systematic review was conducted to identify published articles relevant to the surgical management of renal or ureteral stones.</p>
<p>Literature searches were performed on English-language publications using the Medline In-Process &amp;amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies (e.g., animal models), commentary, and editorials were excluded. Studies on patients with lower tract stones were excluded (including bladder stones and diversions). Bibliographies of review articles were checked to ensure inclusion of all possibly relevant studies. Multiple reports on the same patient group were carefully examined to ensure inclusion of only non-redundant information.</p></div>"/>

<p>Almost all the studies that reported on preoperative testing (99 computed tomography [CT] scan, 10 renal scan, 128 renal ultrasound [US], 188 kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB), 156 intravenous pyelogram [IVP], 68 complete blood count [CBC], 29 stone analysis and 112 urine culture) did not report the purpose of performing these tests. There were no reliable data on the utility or incremental value of testing. The procedures of interest were percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), ureteroscopy (URS), laparoscopy, shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL), open surgery, robotic surgery, ureteral stent, or nephrostomy. Comparison of any of these active treatments against each other or against medical management was done when possible. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) was evaluated in terms of efficacy against placebo. Outcomes included stone-free rate (as determined by KUB, US, IVP, nephrotomogram, computed tomography [CT], endoscopy); residual fragments (by size); secondary procedures needed (stone-removing versus ancillary); QoL; pain; analgesic requirements; length of hospitalization; comparative recurrence rates; renal function; and procedure complications (e.g., death, sepsis/systemic inflammatory response syndrome [sirs], transfusion, loss of kidney, readmission rates, overall rates). When multiple studies evaluated the same outcome and had similar population, intervention, and comparison, meta-analysis was conducted using the random effects model, when appropriate. Stone-free rate was stratified based on stone size and location.</p>
<p>The methodology team independently rated the methodological quality of the studies and provided an overall judgment of the whole body of evidence based on confidence in the available estimates of effect.</p>
<p>The methodology team summarized the data with explicit description of study characteristics, methodological quality, main findings, and quality of the evidence (confidence in the estimates). The methodology team attended panel meetings and facilitated incorporation of the evidence into the Guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quality of Individual Studies and Determination of Evidence Strength</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality of individual studies that were either RCTs or CCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The quality of CCTs and comparative observational studies was rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality (NOQ) Assessment Scale. Because there is no widely-agreed upon quality assessment tool for single cohort observational studies, the quality of these studies was not assessed.</p>
<p>The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies (the latter is also called the risk of bias). Evidence strength refers to the body of evidence available for a particular question and includes not only individual study quality but consideration of study design; consistency of findings across studies; adequacy of sample sizes; and generalizability of samples, settings, and treatments for the purposes of the guideline (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Procedure complications include death, sepsis/systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), loss of kidney, urinary tract infections (UTIs), ureteral stricture, ureteral injury, and unplanned emergency room visits. </li>
    <li>In an older randomized prospective trial comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) to shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL) for the treatment of staghorn calculi, the author found a three-fold higher stone-free rate with PCNL combination therapy (PCNL/SWL) than with SWL monotherapy. In addition, the rate of sepsis is significantly higher with SWL. </li>
    <li>Despite computed tomography's (CT's) diagnostic superiority over other imaging tests, it is incumbent on urologists to be cognizant of the potential risks/harms of the investigations they select for their patients to accurately diagnose and plan appropriate therapies. Concerns regarding the long-term cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation have led to calls for the use of ultrasound (US) in the initial diagnosis of acute flank pain. </li>
    <li>The present Panel's analysis revealed that the risk of ureteral perforation is significantly higher during ureteroscopy (URS) versus SWL (median 3.2% versus 0%, respectively). Likewise, the 2007 European Association of Urology (EAU)/American Urological Association (AUA) Guideline for the Management of Ureteral Calculi found a higher complication rate for URS compared to SWL for stones in all locations in the ureter: 11% versus 4%, respectively, for proximal ureteral stones; 14% versus 4%, respectively, for middle ureteral stones; and 7% versus 1%, respectively, for distal ureteral stones. </li>
    <li>The major disadvantage of electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) is its propensity to damage the ureteral mucosa, resulting in ureteral perforation. It is speculated that the expanding cavitation bubble generated by the spark may produce injury to the mucosa even when the probe is not in direct contact with the urothelium, with reported rates of ureteral injury of 8.5% to 17.6%. </li>
    <li>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of PCNL versus URS reported higher complication rates for PCNL (odds ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.35). The CROES PCNL Global Study reported a 15% overall complication rate with the majority of complications categorized as Clavien Grade I. Bleeding necessitating blood transfusion was the most common complication at 7%. </li>
    <li>Studies have demonstrated morbidity associated with indwelling nephrostomy tubes following PCNL, specifically increased postoperative pain with greater narcotic requirements and increased length of hospitalization. </li>
    <li>It is well recognized that ureteral stents are the source of significant morbidity. </li>
</ul>
<p>The magnitude of benefit or risk/burdens, and the Panel's judgment regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens are taken into account for each guideline statement.

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses ('off label') that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not in-tended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Limitations of the Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence to guide perioperative diagnostic evaluation was sparse and of low quality, affecting recommendations on laboratory testing and imaging. Data on stone-free rate (lithotripsy, ureteroscopy [URS] and percutaneous nephrolithotomy [PCNL]) when stratified by location and stone size were also limited in clinical trials; therefore, rates were also derived from large registries that provided precise, although likely biased, estimates. Comparative effectiveness of medical expulsive therapy (MET) was derived from a large number of trials that overall has a moderate risk of bias. Only a very small number of studies were available to provide comparative effectiveness inferences in children.</p>"/>
