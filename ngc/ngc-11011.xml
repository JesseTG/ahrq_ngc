	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI)</strong>: The recommendations for the healthy lifestyles are presented in the form of a table with a list of evidence-based recommendations accompanied by detailed annotations.</p>
<p>Quality of evidence (Low Quality, Moderate Quality, and High Quality) and strength of recommendation (Weak or Strong) ratings are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Physical Activity</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider prescribing a pedometer for individuals who are trying to increase their level of activity. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Pedometers have been shown to be effective in helping individuals sustain walking programs. They are also among the most cost-effective interventions that increase physical activity. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Walking may be associated with muscle soreness and fatigue. Orthopedic injuries may result from falls or collisions with cars or bicycles. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefit that walking has shown to provide and its cost saving outweigh the difficulty in achieving behavior modification and the low risk of musculoskeletal injury. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Kang et al. 2009; Bravata et al., 2007. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider referring elderly individuals who have insufficient levels of physical activity to a community program. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Community programs have been shown to increase levels of physical activity in the elderly. They are also among the most cost-effective interventions that increase physical activity. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Walking may be associated with muscle soreness and fatigue. Orthopedic injuries may result from falls or collisions with cars or bicycles. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefit that community physical activity programs provide outweigh the difficulty in achieving behavior modification and the low risk of musculoskeletal injury. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: March et al., 2015 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Tobacco</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider offering behavioral and/or pharmacologic interventions to patients who smoke. Given its superior effectiveness, the combination of pharmacotherapy supported by behavioral interventions should be provided if acceptable to the patient. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Smoking cessation, or even decreased tobacco use, as well as avoidance of secondhand smoke in non-smokers markedly decreases the risk of several different chronic diseases, particularly heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Behavioral interventions may be difficult and challenging to maintain. Bupropion sustained release (SR) and varenicline, as well as other various types of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), all have the potential for side effects. Clinicians should read the product insert, and consider adverse reactions and contraindications prior to prescribing any medication. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefits of decreased tobacco use and avoidance of secondhand smoke far outweigh the potential harms of the various interventions. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Patnode et al., 2015; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), 2015; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarettes may be as effective as other types of NRT, but they may also have unrecognized harms; the potential benefits cannot currently be shown to outweigh the potential risks. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Insufficient; Strength of Recommendation: N/A</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: E-cigarettes may be an effective method of helping individuals quit smoking. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: The long-term safety of e-cigarettes have not been proven. Certain flavorings, when heated, have been shown to form compounds with known pulmonary toxicity, including diacetyl, which can cause irreversible bronchiolitis obliterans. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The potential benefits cannot currently be shown to outweigh the potential risks. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Ebbert, Agunwamba, &amp;amp; Rutten, 2015; Leventhal et al., 2015; USPSTF, 2015; McRobbie et al., 2014; Orr &amp;amp; Asal, 2014. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Alcohol</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider offering a brief behavioral intervention for individuals who screen positive on a validated tool for risky/hazardous drinking. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Brief interventions have been shown in multiple studies to reduce alcohol consumption. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: The main harm is using time in a patient visit that could be dedicated to other medical concerns. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The potential benefits of reduced alcohol consumption outweigh the potential risk of mismanaging clinical time with the patient. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Alvarez-Bueno et al., 2015; USPSTF, 2013; Jonas et al., 2012; Bertholet et al., 2005. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Nutrition</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider advising motivated patients who are not at goal to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables each day. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Increase in fruit and vegetable consumption (which results in more fiber consumption) has been linked to reduced mortality from cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and strong correlation between weight management and fruit and vegetable intakes. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Possible financial constraints associated with purchasing additional fruit and vegetable choices. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Long-term benefits and possible health care savings outweigh the initial food purchase costs. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Oyebode et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Bellavia et al., 2013. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider prescribing a Mediterranean-style* or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)** dietary pattern for individuals wanting to improve their nutrition status. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Mediterranean-style diet consists of an abundant amount of vegetables, legumes and whole grains; moderate red meat intakes with seafood and chicken selections when animal protein is consumed; and usage of olive oil and nuts as primary fat sources.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>**DASH diet consists of a flexible eating plan that includes a large amount of fruit and vegetable choices, low-fat dairy options, whole grains, very lean animal protein choices and frequent consumption of legumes and nuts.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Mediterranean dietary patterns have been associated with decreased mortality from stroke and cardiovascular disease, and reduced inflammation as well as some slower cognitive decline. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: High consumption of fish may be difficult because of taste preferences, allergies or availability. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption could cause financial constraints. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Long-term health benefits and potential for prevention of long-term diseases outweigh the harms. Options are also available for individuals who cannot consume fish/seafood. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Harmon et al., 2015; Koloverou et al., 2016; Estruch et al., 2013; Kastorini et al., 2011; Sofi et al., 2010; F&amp;eacute;art et al., 2009. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider recommending self-monitoring (food journals, phone applications, tracking Web sites, advanced meal planning) for obese and overweight patients. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Consistent tracking of intakes has been linked with increased fiber from fruit and vegetable consumption, reduction of body weight and overall improvement of self-awareness in relation to healthy habits. <em>While trials have been done in obese patients, the work group feels this recommendation may apply to any patient wanting to change dietary behavior.</em> </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Limited harms associated with self-monitoring. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Benefits of tracking far outweigh any harms. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Lyzwinski, 2014; Lieffers &amp;amp; Hanning, 2012; Acharya et al., 2011; Burke et al., 2011. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Healthy Thinking</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider positive psychology interventions for patients interested in increasing their healthy mental habits. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Interventions that focus on gratitude, kindness and appreciation (e.g., taking stock at the end of every day and finding three good things that happened and why they did, thanking people when they help, and making a point of practicing acts of kindness) have evidence of benefit. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) are a low-cost, non-pharmacological interventions that have been shown to have positive impact on psychological well-being and resilience. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Potential harms of PPIs might include disappointment on the part of individuals if energy expended in these activities was not rewarded by improvements in general mood or well-being. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefits of PPIs appear to outweigh any associated risks of this practice. </li>

<p>The development process is based on a number of long-proven approaches and is continually being revised based on changing community standards. The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) staff, in consultation with the work group and a medical librarian, conduct a literature search to identify systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, meta-analysis, other guidelines, regulatory statements and other pertinent literature. This literature is evaluated based on the GRADE methodology by work group members. When needed, an outside methodologist is consulted.</p>
<p>The work group uses this information to develop or revise clinical flows and algorithms, write recommendations, and identify gaps in the literature. The work group gives consideration to the importance of many issues as they develop the guideline. These considerations include the systems of care in our community and how resources vary, the balance between benefits and harms of interventions, patient and community values, the autonomy of clinicians and patients and more. All decisions made by the work group are done using a consensus process.</p>
<p>ICSI's medical group members and sponsors review each guideline as part of the revision process. They provide comment on the scientific content, recommendations and implementation strategies. This feedback is used by and responded to by the work group as part of their revision work. Final review and approval of the guideline is done by ICSI's Committee on Evidence-Based Practice. This committee is made up of practicing clinicians and nurses, drawn from ICSI member medical groups.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implementation Recommendations and Measures</span></strong></p>
<p>These are provided to assist medical groups and others to implement the recommendations in the guidelines. Where possible, implementation strategies are included that have been formally evaluated and tested. Measures are included that may be used for quality improvement as well as for outcome reporting. When available, regulatory or publicly reported measures are included.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Document Revision Cycle</span></strong></p>
<p>Scientific documents are revised as indicated by changes in clinical practice and literature. ICSI staff monitors major peer-reviewed journals for any pertinent evidence that would affect a particular guideline and recommendation.</p></div>"/>
