	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Issues Related to Renal Replacement Modality Selection in Patients with Diabetes and End-stage Renal Disease</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 start with peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis (HD) as a first modality?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) recommends giving priority to the patient's general status and preference in selecting renal replacement therapy as there is an absence of evidence of superiority of one modality over another in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5 (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends providing patients with unbiased information about the different available treatment options (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients opting to start HD, the GDG suggests preferring high flux over low flux when this is available (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests diabetes has no influence on the choice between HD or haemodiafiltration (HDF) (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Should patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5 start dialysis earlier, i.e., before becoming symptomatic, than patients without diabetes?</strong></p>
<p>The GDG recommends initiating dialysis in patients with diabetes on the same criteria as in patients without diabetes (<strong>1A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>In patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5, should a native fistula, graft or tunnelled catheter be preferred as initial access?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG recommends that reasonable effort be made to avoid tunnelled catheters as primary access in patients with diabetes starting HD as renal replacement therapy (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that the advantages, disadvantages and risks of each type of access be discussed with the patient. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there a benefit to undergoing renal transplantation for patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5?</strong></p>
<p>The GDG recommends providing education on the different options of transplantation and their expected outcomes for patients with diabetes and CKD stage 4 or 5 who are deemed suitable for transplantation (see Table 5 in the original guideline document) (<strong>1D</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Statements Only for Patients with Type 1 Diabetes and CKD Stage 5</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG suggests living donation kidney transplantation or simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation to improve survival of suitable patients (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests against islet transplantation after kidney transplantation with the aim to improve survival (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests pancreas grafting to improve survival after kidney transplantation (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Statements Only for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and CKD Stage 5</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG recommends against pancreas or simultaneous kidney pancreas transplantation (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends diabetes in itself should not be considered a contraindication to kidney transplantation in patients who otherwise comply with inclusion and exclusion criteria for transplantation (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Issues Related to Glycaemic Control in Patients with Diabetes and CKD Stage 3b or Higher (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] &amp;lt;45 mL/min)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Should the aim be to lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) by tighter glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. Is an aggressive treatment strategy (in number of injections and controls and follow-up) superior to a more relaxed treatment strategy in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) and using insulin?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG recommends against tighter glycaemic control if this results in severe hypoglycaemic episodes (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends vigilant attempts to tighten glycaemic control with the intention to lower HbA1C when values are &amp;gt;8.5% (69 mmol/mol) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests vigilant attempts to tighten glycaemic control with the intention to lower HbA1C according to the flow chart in Figure 4 (in the original guideline document) in all other conditions (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends intense self-monitoring only to avoid hypoglycaemia in patients at high risk for hypoglycaemia (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there better alternatives than HbA1c to estimate glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)?</strong></p>
<p>The GDG recommends the use of HbA1C as a routine reference to assess longer term glycaemic control in patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) (<strong>1C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>A. Is any oral drug superior to another in terms of mortality/complications/glycaemic control in patients with diabetes type 2 and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. In patients with diabetes type 2 and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), is maximal oral therapy better than starting/adding insulin at an earlier stage?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG recommends metformin in a dose adapted to renal function as a first line agent when lifestyle measures alone are insufficient to get HbA1C in the desired range according to Figure 4 in the original guideline document (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends adding on a drug with a low risk for hypoglycaemia (see Figures 5, 6, and 7 in the original guideline document) as an additional agent when improvement of glycaemic control is deemed appropriate according to Figure 4 in the original guideline document (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends instructing patients to temporarily withdraw metformin in conditions of pending dehydration, when undergoing contrast media investigations, or in situations with an increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Issues Related to Management of Cardiovascular Risk in Patients with Diabetes and CKD Stage 3b or Higher</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or on dialysis and with coronary artery disease (CAD), is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or conservative treatment to be preferred?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG recommends not omitting coronary angiography with the sole intention of avoiding potential contrast-related deterioration of kidney function in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) in whom a coronary angiography is indicated (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that optimal medical treatment should be considered as preferred treatment in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b to stage 5 who have stable CAD, unless there are large areas of ischaemia or significant left main or proximal left anterior descending (LAD) lesions (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that when a decision is taken to consider revascularization, CABG is preferred over PCI in patients with multi-vessel or complex (SYNTAX score &amp;gt;22) CAD (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) who present with an acute coronary event should be treated no differently than patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) without diabetes or patients with diabetes without CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or on dialysis and with a cardiac indication (heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension) should inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as cardiovascular prevention be prescribed?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>The GDG suggests against applying lower blood pressure targets in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) than in the general population (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) but without proteinuria, all blood pressure-lowering drugs can be used equally to lower blood pressure (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>

    <li>The GDG recommends starting a statin in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b and 4 (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests a statin be considered in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5 (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>

    <li>The GDG suggests that patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) perform additional physical exercise at least three times 1/2 to 1 hour/week to reduce fat mass and improve quality of life (QoL) (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that there is no evidence of harm when promoting an individualized regimen of increased physical exercise (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>When promoting weight loss in patients with diabetes and with overweight, the GDG recommends supervision of this process by a dietician and to ensure that only fat mass is lost and malnutrition is avoided (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), should antiplatelet therapy be recommended, regardless of the cardiovascular risk?</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GDG recommends against adding glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors to standard care to reduce death, myocardial infarction, or need for coronary revascularization in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or high-risk coronary artery intervention (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests not adding a thienopyridine or ticagrelor to standard care to reduce death, myocardial infarction, or need for coronary revascularization in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) and ACSs or high-risk coronary artery intervention unless there is no additional risk factor for bleeding (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends starting aspirin as secondary prevention, unless there is a contraindication, side effects or intolerance (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests starting aspirin as primary prevention only in patients without additional risk factors for major bleeding (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>

<p>With the final guideline scope as point of departure, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) identified specific research questions for which a systematic review would be conducted. All questions addressed issues related to one of the following three areas:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Renal replacement modality selection in patients with diabetes with end-stage renal disease (chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 5) </li>
    <li>Glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &amp;lt;45 mL/min) </li>
    <li>Management of cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &amp;lt;45 mL/min) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Review Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>The methods support team assisted in developing review questions, i.e., framing the clinical questions into a searchable format. This required detailed specification of the patient group (P), intervention (I), comparator (C) and outcomes (O) for intervention questions and the patient group, index tests, reference standard and target conditions for questions of diagnostic test accuracy. For each question, the GDG agreed upon explicit review question criteria including study design features (see Appendices in the original guideline document for detailed review questions and PICO tables).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Searching for Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>
<p>The European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) methods support team searched The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (May 2014), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, May 2014), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, May 2014) and Medline (1946 to May, week 4, 2014) for all questions. The search strategies combined subject headings and text words for the patient population, index test and target condition for the diagnostic questions and subject headings and text words for the population and intervention for the intervention questions. The detailed search strategies are available in Appendix 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Reference lists from the included publications were screened to identify additional papers. The methods support team also searched guideline databases and organizations including the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), Guidelines International Network, Guidelines Finder, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and professional societies of nephrology and endocrinology for guidelines to screen the reference lists.</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong></p>
<p>For diagnostic questions, the GDG included all studies that compared any of the pre-defined clinical or biochemical tests with a golden standard reference test. For intervention questions, the GDG included all studies in which one of the pre-defined interventions was evaluated in humans. The GDG excluded case series that reported on benefit if the number of participants was &amp;le;5, but included even individual case reports if they reported an adverse event. No restriction was made based on language.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Selection</strong></p>
<p>The guideline development group (GDG) used the Early Reference Organisation Software (EROS) (<a href=&quot;http://www.eros-systematic-review.org&quot; title=&quot;EROS Web site&quot;>http://www.eros-systematic-review.org</a>) to organize the initial step of screening and selection of papers. The title and abstract of all papers retrieved by the original search were made available to those responsible for screening through this system. For each question, a member of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) methods support team and one member of the GDG dedicated to this question independently screened all titles and abstracts and discarded the clearly irrelevant ones and those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies at this stage were resolved by consensus.</p>
<p>In a second round, full texts of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and independently examined for eligibility and final inclusion in the data extraction step. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If no consensus could be reached, the disagreement was settled by group arbitrage.</p>
<p>The flow of the paper selection is presented for each question in Appendix 4 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Critical Appraisal of Individual Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>For each included study, the GDG collected relevant information on design, conduct and relevant results through a tailor-made online software system. For each question, two reviewers independently extracted all data. The GDG produced tables displaying the data extraction of both reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus, and if no consensus could be reached, disagreements were resolved by a third independent referee. From these data extraction tables, the GDG produced merged consensus evidence tables for informing the recommendations. The evidence tables are available in Appendix 5 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated using validated checklists, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. These were AMSTAR for Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and case-control studies and QUADAS for diagnostic test accuracy studies. Data were compiled centrally by the ERBP methods support team.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Profiles</span></strong></p>
<p>For research questions regarding therapeutic interventions, the methods support team constructed evidence profiles using the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) toolbox' developed by the international GRADE working group (<a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Working Group Web site&quot;>http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/</a>). The evidence profiles include details of the quality assessment as well as summary&amp;mdash;pooled or unpooled&amp;mdash;outcome data, an absolute measure of intervention effect when appropriate, and the summary of quality of evidence for each outcome. Evidence profiles were reviewed and approved with the rest of the GDG. Evidence profiles were constructed only for research questions addressed by at least two RCTs. If the body of evidence for a particular comparison of interest consisted of only one RCT or of solely observational data, the summary tables provided the final level of synthesis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Rating the Quality of the Evidence for Each Outcome Across Studies</span> </strong></p>
<p>The GDG rated the overall quality of the evidence for each intervention separately addressing each outcome (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). In accordance with GRADE, the GDG initially categorized the quality of the evidence for each outcome as high if it originated predominantly from RCTs and as low if it originated from observational studies. The GDG subsequently downgraded the quality of the evidence one or two levels if results from individual studies were at a high or very high risk of bias, there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, the evidence was indirect, the data were sparse or imprecise or publication bias was suspected.</p>
<p>The quality of evidence arising from observational studies was upgraded if effect sizes were large, there was evidence of a dose-response gradient, or all plausible confounding would either reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Uncontrolled case series and case reports automatically received downgrading from a 'low' to 'very low' level of evidence for risk of bias, so that no other reasons for downgrading were marked.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Establishment of the Guideline Development Group</span></strong></p>
<p>As defined by the guideline development methodology (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) advisory board installed a steering group, which, after selection of the topics, selected further members for the guide- line development group. Members of the steering group and the Guideline Development Group (GDG) were selected based on their clinical and research expertise and their willingness to invest the necessary time and effort to perform the task according to the proposed deadlines and the agreed methodology. The GDG consisted of content experts, including individuals with expertise in endocrinology and diabetes, general internal medicine and clinical nephrology. In addition, experts in epidemiology and systematic review methodology were added to the GDG. The ERBP methods support team provided methodological input and practical assistance throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Formulating and Grading Statements</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Statements</strong></p>
<p>After the evidence tables and profiles had been prepared, revised and approved, the GDG formulated and graded the statements during two full-day plenary meetings.</p>
<p>Recommendations can be for or against a certain strategy. The GDG drafted the statements based on their interpretation of the available evidence. Individual statements were made and discussed in an attempt to reach group consensus. If the GDG could not reach consensus, a formal open vote by show of hands was held. An arbitrary 80% had to cast a positive vote for a statement to be accepted. Voting results and reasons for disagreement were specified in the rationale where applicable. In accordance to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), the GDG classified the strength of the statements as strong or weak (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field and Figure 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Judgements around four key factors determined the strength of a recommendation: the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative therapeutic or diagnostic strategies, the quality of the evidence and the variability in values and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Ungraded Statements</strong></p>
<p>The GDG decided to use an additional category of ungraded statements for areas where formal evidence was not sought and statements were based on common sense, or expert experience alone. The ungraded statements were generally written as simple declarative statements but were not intended to be stronger than level 1 or 2 recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Internal Review</strong></p>
<p>A first draft of the guideline was sent to internal reviewers from the European Renal Association&amp;ndash;European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) council and the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) advisory board. Internal reviewers were asked to comment on the statements and the rationale within free text fields. All these comments and suggestions were discussed during an ERBP advisory board meeting, during a meeting of the ERBP methods support team, and during an additional teleconference meeting of the Guideline Development Group (GDG). For each comment or suggestion, the GDG evaluated whether the statement needed to be adapted, again taking into account the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence, and the variability in values and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>The guideline was sent to the Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA), the European Society of Endocrinology, Kidney Health Australia&amp;ndash;Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment (KHA-CARI) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN), with the request to have the guideline evaluated by two of their members.</p>
<p>In addition, all members of the ERA-EDTA received an online questionnaire in Survey Monkey format to evaluate the guideline using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)-II framework. In addition, a free text field was provided to allow for additional comments.</p>
<p>All comments and suggestions were discussed with the GDG by e-mail, as well as during a final meeting of the co-chairs of the GDG, the methods support team and the chair of ERBP.</p></div>"/>
