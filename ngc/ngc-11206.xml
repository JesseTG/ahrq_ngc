	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>This discussion of iliac artery occlusive disease reviews the broader topic of peripheral vascular disease. Consensus documents provide a comprehensive overview of this complex topic. The consensus recommendations can be modulated by more recent literature with specific attention to iliac disease. Additionally, more recent literature review has allowed for evidence-based management in the surgical and endovascular approach of aortoiliac occlusive disease.</p>
<p>Iliac artery occlusive disease can present as a sudden-onset acute thrombotic event or a chronic, progressive atherosclerotic process. History and physical examination rapidly establish this distinction and determine the most appropriate application of further clinical and imaging examinations. Suspected acute thrombotic events often require rapid evaluation for limb salvage, and the methods and urgency of clinical and imaging examinations in this setting differ from those applied to progressive atherosclerotic disease. In all cases, initial physical examination by a vascular specialist should include evaluation of extremity pulses, capillary refill, skin quality, color and qualitative temperature, and evidence of tissue compromise. Lower-extremity noninvasive physiologic studies such as pulse volume recording (PVR) and ankle brachial index (ABI) are simple and valuable tools in the screening and management of the patients with chronic limb ischemia. ABI is measurement of the ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure ratio. Plethysmography, another uncommonly used test, detects the changes in the limb volume by PVR. Over a period of time, use of plethysmography and PVR has fallen out of favor because of their lack of reliable and reproducible quantitative data.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Diagnostic Imaging and Therapeutic Options</strong></p>
<p>Diagnostic imaging is tailored to the clinical presentation and may include ultrasound (US) with Doppler vascular US, computed tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and catheter-directed digital subtraction angiography (DSA). When considering CTA in patients with marginal renal function, dilute iso-osmolar contrast, hydration with sodium bicarbonate solution, and pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine sodium bicarbonate drip may be beneficial, although application of these options is controversial. When considering MRA, time-of-flight sequences may be used when contrast cannot be administered. Depending on the pathophysiology and clinical presentation, therapeutic options for acute thrombotic causes include supportive care, anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy, either surgical or catheter-directed mechanical thrombectomy, and surgical bypass. Therapeutic options for atherosclerotic disease include supportive measures such as behavior modification, a supervised exercise program, adjunctive anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications, angioplasty, stent placement, stent-graft placement, surgical or catheter-directed endarterectomy/plaque excision, and surgical bypass.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Procedures by Variant</strong></p>
<p><em>Variant 1: Nonsmoker, Sedentary Lifestyle. No Symptoms at Rest but Mild Left Lower-extremity Claudication on Walking, Asymmetrically Diminished Left Femoral Pulse. Next Steps on Initial Physician Visit</em></p>
<p>Chronic iliac artery occlusive disease resulting from atherosclerosis may be asymptomatic or incidentally identified on diagnostic imaging studies or may present with claudication, reproducible lower-extremity pain that is brought on by walking or exercise and relieved by rest. Typically, noninvasive screening begins with US and measurement of ABI and/or segmental arterial pressures in the outpatient clinic setting. ABIs may be normal at rest in the setting of isolated iliac occlusive disease. Arterial imaging is indicated in patients with abnormal resting ABIs or abnormal postexercise ABIs in whom revascularization would be performed if an amenable lesion was identified. Plethysmography and PVR are becoming less commonly used in most modern laboratories because of their lack of reliability and reproducibility. If findings suggest peripheral artery disease (PAD), further confirmation with CTA or MRA is usually required to determine the best application of endovascular or surgical intervention. The notion that CTA unnecessarily increases contrast load and related risks may not hold true since the CTA findings usually facilitate a marked decrease in contrast dose required for endovascular interventions. In most cases, catheter-directed DSA is performed only at the time of endovascular intervention, but in some cases, DSA may augment cross-sectional imaging options prior to intervention by providing diagnostic information regarding the patency of medium and small runoff arteries. Ultimately, catheter-directed DSA is performed in most patients prior to revascularization. Intra-arterial pressure measurements may be of value, with systolic gradients &amp;gt;10 mm Hg at rest or following pharmacologic challenge considered significant.</p>
<p>In all cases of chronic limb ischemia, medical management is a key component of treatment and should include risk factor modification such as smoking cessation and control of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. A lipid profile should be obtained covering total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and (in younger patients) homocysteine levels. Medical strategies such as a supervised exercise program and antiplatelet therapies such as cilostazol or aspirin should be considered in appropriate patients, but patients with iliac lesions, as opposed to infrainguinal disease, may be considered for revascularization without undergoing extensive medical therapy. The CLEVER study demonstrated superior treadmill walking performance at 6-month follow-up in the supervised exercise cohort versus the primary stenting cohort for patients with claudication resulting from aortoiliac PAD.</p>
<p><em>Variant 2: Long History of Mild Claudication. Acute-Onset Left Lower-Extremity Pain. Absent Left Femoral Pulse on Palpation, Faint Dorsalis Pedis and Posterior Tibial Pulses by Doppler. Next Steps</em></p>
<p><em>Variant 3: Known Atrial Fibrillation and Spine Surgery 3 Weeks Ago. Sudden-Onset Right Lower-Extremity Pain. Diminished Pulses in Right Lower Extremity. CTA Demonstrates Isolated Filling Defect in Right Common Iliac Artery</em></p>
<p>Acute iliac artery ischemia can occur because of thromboembolism, atheroembolism, in situ native arterial thrombosis, or thrombosis of a surgical bypass graft. The goal is prompt restoration of distal blood flow. Acute-onset iliac occlusive disease typically presents as sudden-onset pain in the lower limb(s). Prompt determination of the duration and severity of symptoms and any prior surgical and endovascular procedures is essential. On clinical examination, pulses are usually diminished or absent depending upon the level of thrombosis and the severity of any coexisting atherosclerotic disease. Considering the acute nature of the presentation, screening tools such as plethysmography and PVR are usually not the diagnostic tests of choice. CTA is fast and reveals the exact nature and level of both thrombosis and underlying atherosclerotic plaque in order to plan an appropriate treatment strategy. MRA is an alternative when time permits. ABI and Doppler US may be considered in patients who are not suitable for CTA, such as patients with renal dysfunction or knee/hip prosthesis.</p>
<p>Patients presenting with acute limb ischemia without contraindications to anticoagulation should receive anticoagulated therapy immediately, usually with heparin. All patients, particularly those with atypical presentations, should be evaluated for hypercoagulability. This assessment may be initiated concurrently with anticoagulation therapy and may include prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and levels of factor V Leiden, factor II (prothrombin) C-20210a, anticardiolipin antibody, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III. In addition to systemic anticoagulation, treatment options include a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy. Ultimately, treatment of any causative underlying lesion by endovascular or surgical means is extremely important to prevent or delay the recurrence of the symptoms.</p>
<p>The most extensively studied and commonly used endovascular option is catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis. Alteplase, reteplase, and urokinase are the most frequently used agents, and a wide variety of infusion protocols have been described. There is evidence that the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist abciximab may reduce distal emboli. US-assisted pharmacologic thrombolysis, suction embolectomy, and rheolytic therapy are broadly accepted options and may be used in conjunction with other therapies. US-assisted techniques may reduce the duration of thrombolysis infusion; suction embolectomy and rheolytic options may be particularly useful when thrombolysis is contraindicated. Surgical options include catheter embolectomy and bypass. Although there is no convincing evidence for the universal superiority of either endovascular or surgical approaches, distinguishing embolic from in situ lesions may help in planning therapy. Furthermore, the severity of ischemia and ability to tolerate surgery are important factors for consideration.</p>
<p>For native-vessel thrombosis, a trial of thrombolytic therapy is recommended for viable limbs. In cases where a guidewire can be passed across the lesion, catheter-directed thrombolysis may be instituted. In cases where a guidewire cannot be successfully passed, regional thrombolysis should be attempted. Prospective, randomized trials demonstrate that 1-year limb salvage rates with endovascular techniques are similar to those following surgery, with lower mortality rates but higher rates of recurrent ischemia and amputation. The endovascular approach allows treatment of the underlying lesion following thrombolysis, and gradual low-pressure reperfusion may avoid reperfusion injury. The use of mechanical techniques may allow more prompt restoration of flow and expanded use of endovascular techniques in the threatened limb. Surgical approaches should be reserved for patients in whom thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy failed, for situations in which an unacceptable delay due to attempted endovascular techniques jeopardizes the viability of a limb, or for nonviable limbs.</p>
<p>For embolic occlusions, a consensus document recommends that isolated suprainguinal emboli be removed surgically. If embolic fragmentation and distal embolization into peripheral vessels have occurred, endovascular thrombolytic therapy is the preferred therapeutic option. Echocardiography is not necessary prior to thrombolytic therapy for embolic disease.</p>
<p>For occluded aortoiliac or aortofemoral bypass grafts, catheter-directed thrombolysis is the preferred option in grafts occluded &amp;lt;14 days. Despite a higher risk of amputation, catheter-directed therapy allows underlying lesions to be defined and treated. Furthermore, surgical risks related to reoperative anatomy and wound complications can be avoided. Following management of an acute thrombotic event, these patients should undergo consultation for appropriate medical management of risk factors, a supervised exercise program, and initiation of antiplatelet therapy.</p>
<p><em>Variant 4: Past Medical History of Heavy Smoking. Severe Claudication and No Symptoms at Rest. Angiogram Demonstrates Bilateral 90% Common Iliac Artery Stenosis (TASC A)</em></p>
<p><em>Variant 5: Past Medical History Significant for Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Smoking. Increasing Claudication of Right Lower Extremity Involving Right Buttock for Last 3 Months. CTA Pelvis with Runoff Reveals Short-Segment Occlusion of Right Common Iliac Artery (TASC B)</em></p>
<p><em>Variant 6: Past Medical History Significant for Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Heavy Smoking. Gradually Increasing Claudication of Bilateral Lower Extremities for at Least 2 Months. CTA Pelvis with Runoff Reveals Bilateral Common Iliac Artery Occlusion without Any Involvement of the External or Internal Iliac Artery (TASC C)</em></p>
<p><em>Variant 7: Worsening Claudication and Small Ischemic Ulcers on Digits of Both Feet. Angiogram Demonstrates Diffuse Disease Involving Distal Aorta and Both Iliac Vessels, with Multiple Stenoses &amp;gt;50%, Bilateral 75% Mid&amp;ndash;superficial Femoral Artery Stenosis, and 2-Vessel Tibial Runoff Bilaterally (TASC D)</em></p>
<p>Chronic iliac arterial occlusive disease is chronic, progressive atherosclerosis that may remain asymptomatic or present with claudication. In severe cases (ABI &amp;lt;0.4), patients present with rest pain or critical limb ischemia (CLI) with associated ulcers or gangrene. Although iliac occlusive disease is commonly a contributing factor to CLI, it seldom exists as an isolated lesion. Noninvasive evaluation includes ABI, segmental arterial pressures, US, and either CTA or MRA to plan either endovascular or surgical intervention. The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease document described anatomic classification and therapeutic recommendations for iliac occlusive disease. TASC II has modified these recommendations for consistency; the TASC II classification scheme was used to describe Variants 4 through 7. Endovascular therapy is the treatment of choice for TASC A and B lesions, and recent studies confirm an expanded role for endovascular therapy in TASC C and D lesions, which were historically treated with surgical options.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty versus Stent</span></p>
<p>The Dutch iliac stent trial concluded that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective stent placement yielded patency rates similar to those occurring with primary stenting. More recent stratified studies have documented that primary angioplasty with selective stenting is effective for TASC A and B lesions. However, stenting has demonstrated significant benefits over angioplasty alone in TASC C and D lesions. A recent large meta-analysis demonstrated significantly higher 12-month primary patency rates for primary stenting (92.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 89.0%&amp;ndash;94.3%) in comparison to selective stenting (82.9%; 95% CI, 72.2%&amp;ndash;90.0%) for TASC C and D lesions. Other authors have found patency rates for primary stenting of TASC C and D lesions to be similar to those for TASC A and B lesions. Finally, a recent study found no significant difference in the patency rates of iliac artery stents among all TASC categories, questioning the utility of the TASC classification and associated endovascular and surgical recommendations in iliac disease. It appears that primary stenting is the preferred treatment for most patients with TASC A-D lesions. However, primary stenting has demonstrated significantly higher complication rates in TASC C and D lesions in comparison to TASC A and B lesions.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Bare Metal versus Covered Stent</span></p>
<p>With respect to the role of stents covered with polytetrafluoroethylene in treating iliac occlusive disease, 2 studies have confirmed its technical feasibility, and both demonstrated 1-year primary patency rates of 91%. One report described a significant benefit of using covered balloon-expandable stents in type C and D lesions as compared to bare metal stents at 18-month follow-up with respect to binary restenosis (95.4% versus 82.2%), amputation rate (1.2% versus 3.6%), and clinical improvement (94.2% versus 76.7%). Another study demonstrated significantly higher 5-year primary patency rates with the use of stent grafts as compared to bare metal stents (87% versus 53%) in patients undergoing simultaneous common femoral artery (CFA) endarterectomy and iliac revascularization. Additional information regarding patency rates of covered stents will also be provided by long-term review of aortic endograft experience.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Surgery versus Endovascular Therapy</span></p>
<p>For TASC C and D lesions, surgery has historically been recommended; however, more recent data suggest an expanded role for endovascular therapy. Meta-analysis of long-term results for aortofemoral bypass grafts for iliac disease demonstrated 5-year limb-based patency rates of 90% in claudicants and 87% in patients with CLI. Two recent studies comparing surgical aortofemoral bypass to aortoiliac angioplasty and stenting demonstrate similar results. Surgical bypass yielded higher 3-year primary patency rates and greater improvement in ABIs but at the cost of increased surgical complication rates, including the need for emergency surgery, infection, transfusion, and lymph leak. Endovascular therapy shortens the initial hospitalization stay and is associated with half the number of readmissions. Importantly, neither study demonstrated a significant difference in secondary patency rates, limb salvage, or long-term survival.</p>
<p>The durability of endovascular recanalization of the iliac arteries has been established, although primary patency is generally less than that of surgery. A recent study involving iliac recanalization demonstrated 1-, 2-, and 3-year primary patency rates of 86%, 76%, and 68%, respectively. Secondary patency rates were 94%, 92%, and 80%, respectively. Another study has reported 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year primary patency rates of 90%, 85%, 80%, and 68%, respectively. Despite substantial variation between these studies, the long-term patency of recanalized iliac segments has proven satisfactory. The more recent BRAVISSIMO study demonstrated primary patency rates at 24 months for TASC A, B, C, and D lesions of 88.0%, 88.5%, 91.9%, and 84.8.2%, respectively, with no statistical difference when comparing the 4 groups, suggesting endovascular therapy is the preferred treatment for patients with TASC A-D aortoiliac lesions. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis comprising 16 studies and 958 patients evaluates endovascular therapy for TASC D lesions and demonstrates technical success and 12-month primary patency rates of 90.1% and 87.3%, respectively. Bifurcated endografts demonstrated a technical success rate of 100% and promising long-term results in TASC C and D lesions in a recent study.</p>
<p>Surgical intervention incurs higher morbidity, including risk of impotence and retrograde ejaculation; endovascular therapies allow greater ease of reintervention. With perpetual improvements in both technology and operator experience, several recent studies have further demonstrated adequate evidence of safety and efficacy with subintimal recanalization and re-entry into the true lumen, with success rates ranging from 71% to 100%. Additionally, subintimal revascularization has demonstrated success and safety in chronic total iliac artery occlusions, including long-segment (&amp;gt;5 cm) occlusions. The TASC authors have noted that when choosing between endovascular and open-surgical/bypass therapies with equivalent short-term and long-term outcomes, endovascular techniques should be used first.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Endovascular Adjunct to Other Procedures</span></p>
<p>Endovascular therapy may be an adjunct to a separate surgical or endovascular procedure. It has been demonstrated that an ipsilateral stenotic, but not occluded, superficial femoral artery (SFA) is a predictor of iliac intervention failure and that SFA stenoses should be addressed at the time of iliac intervention. When iliac intervention is performed in conjunction with infrainguinal surgical bypass, graft patency is significantly greater with stenting as compared to angioplasty alone and is similar to that of aortofemoral bypass at 5 years. For external iliac artery disease that extends into the CFA, external iliac artery stent placement with CFA endarterectomy and patch angioplasty has produced durable results with less extensive surgery than conventional bypass. One study evaluating the combined CFA endarterectomy with stenting of the common or external iliac artery demonstrated a 5-year primary patency rate of 60% and a secondary patency rate of 98%. Endovascular repair and femoral-femoral bypass may be useful in patients with a stenotic segment &amp;lt;5 cm in the inflow limb and contralateral iliac occlusion but not in patients with stenoses &amp;gt;5 cm (primary patency rates at 3 years are 85% and 31%, respectively).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Predictors of Success and Failure</span></p>
<p>Multivariate analysis of independent predictors for iliac intervention failure has described a 3-year primary patency rate of iliac intervention of 36% for untreated stenotic (&amp;gt;50%) for SFAs in the setting of iliac artery angioplasty or stent. SFAs that are occluded, patent, or receiving concomitant angioplasty at the time of iliac intervention demonstrated 3-year primary patency rates of 84%, 81%, and 75%, respectively. Occluded SFAs can be observed, but stenotic SFAs should be repaired at the time of iliac intervention. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, poor tibial runoff, external iliac artery disease, female gender, smoking, gangrene, ulcer, diabetes mellitus, presence of a distal bypass, and hormone replacement therapy in female patients are all independent predictors of failure. Immediate hemodynamic improvement and the presence of 2-vessel femoral or 2-vessel tibial runoff have been found to be predictors of favorable outcome. In addition, these patients should undergo consultation for medical management of risk factors, a supervised exercise program, and initiation of antiplatelet therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For patients with mild claudication, noninvasive screening with US and measurement of ABI and/or segmental arterial pressures followed by confirmation with CTA or MRA, if indicated, are recommended on the initial physician visit. Once the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease is confirmed, a supervised exercise program and risk factor modification such as smoking cessation and control of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension are recommended. </li>
    <li>For the diagnosis of the acute thromboembolic event, CTA is fast and reveals the exact nature and level of both thrombosis and underlying atherosclerotic plaque. MRA is an alternative when time permits. Doppler US may be considered in patients who are not suitable for CTA, such as patients with renal dysfunction or knee/hip prosthesis. </li>
    <li>An isolated acute embolic event involving the common iliac artery is best treated by surgical revascularization. Catheter-directed mechanical thrombectomy is usually appropriate. Anticoagulation is usually indicated except in situations such as recent surgery. </li>
    <li>For TASC A lesions, bilateral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone or in combination with stent placement in patients with suboptimal results after PTA and adjunctive antiplatelet therapy is usually appropriate. </li>
    <li>For TASC B lesions, bilateral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone or in combination with stent placement in patients with suboptimal results after PTA and adjunctive antiplatelet therapy is usually appropriate. </li>
    <li>For TASC C lesions, primary stenting combined with antiplatelet therapy is usually the first choice, followed by open surgery if endovascular therapy fails. </li>
    <li>For TASC D lesions, catheter-directed aortoiliac stent/stent-graft placement with or without femoral angioplasty combined with antiplatelet therapy is usually the first choice, followed by open surgery if endovascular therapy fails. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Rating Appropriateness</span></strong></p>
<p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness. When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.</p>
<p>The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category &quot;usually not appropriate&quot; where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category &quot;usually appropriate&quot; where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated &quot;may be appropriate,&quot; is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.</p>
<p>The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the first rating round, a conference call is scheduled to discuss the evidence and, if needed, clarify the variant or procedure description. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is &quot;May be appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized, and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the <a href=&quot;https://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>Rating Round Information</a> document.</p>

    <li>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. </li>
    <li>ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply society endorsement of the final document. </li>
