	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>Are hospital-based intervention programs (HVIPs) attending to adult patients (age 18+) treated for intentional violent injury more effective than usual standard care in improving the following outcomes: intentional violent injury reinjury and/or death; arrest and/or incarceration; substance abuse and/or mental issues; quality of life; job and/or school attainment?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors make no recommendation with respect to adult-focused HVIP interventions to reduce violent reinjury and other outcomes, due to quality of evidence concerns such as self-selection bias and small sample sizes. However, they acknowledge that some single center programs have been effective at improving outcomes among motivated patients. Ensuring that studies are sufﬁciently and adequately staffed, continuing efforts to increase research funding for gun violence-related issues, and developing strategies to not only reach but also retain adult populations injured in intentional violence may lessen the constraints prohibiting robust empirical support for HVIPs.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>Studies included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies, and case&amp;ndash;control studies. Case reports, conceptual pieces, and reviews containing no original data or analyses were excluded. Additionally, any papers on child abuse, sexual assault, and/or intimate partner violence were excluded. Studies were limited to those written in English and conducted in the United States of America (USA). No limitations were put on year of publication.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A research librarian aided the systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. After a preliminary query, the guideline authors chose to apply the following PubMed search string: (&quot;Violence&quot;[Mesh] AND (&quot;Recurrence&quot;[Mesh] OR recur* OR recidivism) AND &quot;Health Facilities&quot;[Mesh] AND (prevention OR intervention*). The guideline authors then inspected each review article's reference section. No restrictions were placed on either language or dates. They did, however, only include studies in the USA. Figure 1 in the original guideline document contains the MeSH terms used for the initial search. Eight months later a research assistant member of the writing team performed a unique and independent systematic search. Two new articles were found, neither of which met the populations (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcome (O) (PICO) question criteria. Finally, in January 2016, an institutional research librarian performed a literature search which found two additional relevant articles, and these articles were included in their literature review.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>After completing an exhaustive literature search, three independent reviewers and a research assistant screened the titles and abstracts, excluding reviews, case reports, youth-focused articles, and unrelated articles. The articles identiﬁed in 2016 were screened by a single reviewer for inclusion. The resulting studies were used for the review. The study selection process is highlighted in the PRISMA ﬂow diagram for Figure 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>A total of 71 abstracts were identiﬁed by the search. Of these, zero were duplicates, three were excluded after title review, and one more was identiﬁed after abstract review. Of the 25 articles selected for full review, the team found that 8 met their predetermined criteria. The remaining articles were either entirely or primarily youth focused (meaning participants were under the age of 18) or were reviews themselves and were therefore excluded from the ﬁnal data analysis. The subsequent literature search in 2016 found two more articles, bringing the total article number of reviewed articles to 10.</p></div>"/>

<p>All articles, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) resources, and instructions were electronically available to all members of the writing team. Each independent reviewer shared his or her populations (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcome (O) (PICO) sheet and literature review with all members of the team. Independent interpretations of the data were shared through group email, conference calls, and in-person discourse. No major reviewer discrepancies in grading occurred. Had they occurred, the guideline authors would have used a modiﬁed Delphi technique to resolve differences.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methodological Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The validated GRADE methodology was used for this study. The GRADE methodology entails the creation of a predetermined PICO question or set of PICO questions that the literature must answer. Each designated reviewer independently evaluates the data in aggregate with respect to the quality of the evidence to adequately answer each PICO question and quantified the strength of any recommendations. Reviewers are asked to determine effect size, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, precision, and publication bias.</p>

    <li>Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIPs) have emerged nationwide to help address the societal and economic costs of violence. The goal of these programs is to intervene with those individuals who survive violent injury, at this 'sole access point' into the healthcare system. In addressing 'the psychosocial challenges that these patients face,' HVIPs are designed to interrupt the costly cycles of violent injury by transforming medical treatment into a catalyst for life and societal change. </li>
    <li>Of the seven articles reporting measurements of intentional violent injury recidivism and/or death, four demonstrated no effect (among three original sample pools). Three studies consisting of three unique sample pools suggested a positive interventional impact on intentional violent injury recidivism and/or death: The first study noted a 1-year reinjury reduction rate from 8.7% to 2.9%. Authors of the second study wrote that their 'nonintervention group was six times more likely than intervention group to be hospitalized as a result of a violent injury.' The third study reported a reduction in intentional violent reinjury from 16% to 4%. The three studies with a positive outcome had low sample sizes (combined n=254). One of these studies did not report how outcomes were assessed and another was limited by its historical comparison control group and the exclusion of inactive participants when measuring success. </li>

    <li>&quot;Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances.&quot;* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
