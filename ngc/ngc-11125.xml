	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&amp;ndash;2C, consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that the cough be managed according to a published management guideline that initially considers the most common potential etiologies as well as symptomatic gastroesophageal reﬂux (<strong>ungraded, consensus based</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Common potential etiologies include environmental or occupational irritants, primary or secondary smoking, use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, abnormal chest radiographic ﬁndings, asthma, upper airway cough syndrome due to a variety of rhinosinus conditions, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and suppurative lung disease. Often, more than one etiology is a contributing factor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough suspected to be due to reﬂux-cough syndrome, the Expert Panel recommends that treatment include (1) diet modiﬁcation to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; (2) head of bed elevation and avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime; and (3) in patients who report heartburn and regurgitation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists, alginate, or antacid therapy sufﬁcient to control these symptoms (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: (1) While it is expected that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will respond within 4-8 weeks, the literature suggests that improvement in cough may take up to 3 months. (2) Head of bed elevation is suggested based on its utility for improving GI gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms while acknowledging that it has not been demonstrated to be beneﬁcial for cough.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with suspected chronic cough due to reﬂux-cough syndrome, but without heartburn or regurgitation, the Expert Panel recommends against using PPI therapy alone because it is unlikely to be effective in resolving the cough (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough potentially due to reﬂux-cough syndrome who are refractory to a 3-month trial of medical antireﬂux therapy and are being evaluated for surgical management (antireﬂux or bariatric), or in whom there is strong clinical suspicion warranting diagnostic testing for gastroesophageal reﬂux, the Expert Panel suggests that they undergo esophageal manometry and pH-metry with conventional methodology (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Esophageal manometry is done both to evaluate for a major motility disorder and to accurately position the pH electrode for the pH monitoring study. With conventional methodology, the pH electrode is placed 5 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter, and the study is done off antisecretory medications after withholding PPI therapy for 7 days and H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists for 3 days prior to the study. It was agreed by consensus of the Esophageal Diagnostic Advisory Panel composed of both gastroenterologists and surgeons that this is the only methodology with proven validity with respect to surgical outcomes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough and a major motility disorder (e.g., absent peristalsis, achalasia, distal esophageal spasm, hypercontractility) and/or normal acid exposure time in the distal esophagus, the Expert Panel suggests not advising antireﬂux surgery (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Under the circumstances of a major motility disorder or normal esophageal acid exposure on esophageal pH-metry, there is no supportive controlled data for antireﬂux surgery and there is quantiﬁable risk to the procedure making for an unacceptable risk-beneﬁt ratio.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough, adequate peristalsis, and abnormal esophageal acid exposure determined by pH-metry in whom medical therapy has failed the Expert Panel suggests antireﬂux (or bariatric when appropriate) surgery for presumed reﬂux-cough syndrome (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: With respect to deﬁning adequate peristalsis, there is no consensus. Some consider any preserved peristalsis to be adequate while others stipulate that it must be at least 30% and others at least 50% of normal.</p>

<p>The methods used for this systematic review conformed to those outlined in the article &quot;Methodologies for the Development of American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines and Expert Panel Reports&quot; (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Systematic reviews and clinical trials were identiﬁed from searches of electronic databases (Ovid Medline, and EMBASE) commencing from the earliest available date until May 2015. A search of the Cochrane database returned 82 articles, eight of which were sufﬁciently relevant for full text review; however, none met criteria for inclusion in this review. The reference lists of retrieved articles were examined for additional citations. The search terms used were (&quot;Gastroesophageal Reﬂux&quot; [MeSH] OR GERD OR GORD OR reﬂux OR gastroesophageal reﬂux disease OR reﬂux esophagitis OR nonerosive reﬂux disease OR NERD) AND (&quot;Proton Pump Inhibitors&quot; [MeSH] OR PPI OR omeprazole OR lansoprazole OR pantoprazole OR rabeprazole OR esomeprazole OR tenatoprazole OR &quot;Histamine H2 Antagonists&quot; [MeSH] OR prokinetic OR surgery) AND cough. The titles and abstracts of the search results were independently evaluated by two reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles. The full texts of all potentially relevant articles were retrieved, and two reviewers independently reviewed all retrieved studies. A third reviewer was available to adjudicate any disagreements.</p></div>"/>

The rating of the quality of evidence reflects the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence and was based on the study design, risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of results, and likelihood of publication bias, in addition to factors specific to observational studies (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Expert Panel used the published methodology of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guideline Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel Chair and the International Panel of Experts to perform a systematic review and synthesis of evidence and to develop recommendations and practice management suggestions. After generating the key clinical questions for this systematic review, population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) elements were derived to inform the literature review. The questions were formulated after polling the existing writing group for key clinical questions related to chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This returned a list of 20 questions that were then synthesized into two PICO questions that were sufﬁciently broad to capture most of the detail from those 20 questions. The resultant PICO questions that formed the basis of the subsequent systematic review are stated in Table 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The questions that formed the basis of the systematic review were the following: (1) Can therapy intended to treat gastroesophageal reﬂux improve or eliminate cough in adults with refractory chronic cough? (2) Are there minimal clinical criteria to guide clinical practice in determining that a patient's chronic cough is likely to respond to therapy for gastroesophageal reﬂux?</p>
<p>The ﬁndings of the systematic review were used to support the evidence-graded recommendations or suggestions. A structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on guidance statements. In this regard, for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, 75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement. Quality assessment also included grading the strength of recommendations based on consideration of the balance of beneﬁts to harms, patient values and preferences, and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. Harms incorporated risks and burdens to the patients that can include convenience or lack of convenience, difﬁculty of administration, and invasiveness.</p></div>"/>
