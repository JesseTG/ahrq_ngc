<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Male and Female Sterilisation: General Information</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Legal advice should be sought if there is any doubt as to whether a person has the mental capacity to consent to a procedure that will permanently remove their fertility. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Written consent should be obtained from individuals wishing to undergo vasectomy or laparoscopic or hysteroscopic tubal occlusion. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>A consent form and clinical record should be used to document an individual's agreement to the procedure, discussion that took place, requests made by the individual, and any information provided. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-sterilisation Assessment</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All verbal advice must be supported by accurate, impartial, printed or recorded information (in translation, where appropriate and possible), which the individual requesting sterilisation may take away/download and review before the procedure. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Counselling and advice on sterilisation procedures should be provided to women and men within the context of a service providing a full range of information about and access to other long-term reversible methods of contraception. This should include information on the advantages, disadvantages and relative failure rates of each method. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Both vasectomy and tubal occlusion should be discussed with all men and women requesting sterilisation. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>A history should be taken from all men and women requesting vasectomy or tubal occlusion. Scrotal or bimanual pelvic examination should be carried out either at initial consultation or before commencing the procedure. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Individuals should be informed that vasectomy carries a lower failure rate, in terms of post-procedural pregnancies, and that there is less risk associated with the procedure than sterilisation carried out by laparoscopy or laparotomy. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Individuals should be informed of the method of access and tubal occlusion being recommended in their case, the reasons for preferring it over other methods, and the method to be used if the intended procedure cannot be performed. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>When a pregnancy occurs while an individual is on a waiting list for sterilisation they should be offered further counselling about future contraceptive choices due to the change in their circumstances. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>The operating clinician must ensure that information exchange, history and examination have been completed and must be satisfied that the individual does not suffer from concurrent conditions that may require an additional or alternative procedure or precaution. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-sterilisation Assessment</strong></p>
<p><em>Advice Post-vasectomy</em></p>
<p>Men who have undergone vasectomy should be provided with a post-procedural information leaflet that outlines appropriate self-care and instructions. (<strong>GPP</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Advice Post-tubal Occlusion</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Women should be provided with information about the method of tubal occlusion undertaken and of any complications that occurred during the procedure. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women who have undergone tubal occlusion should be provided with a post-procedural information leaflet that outlines appropriate self-care and instructions. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additional Contraception</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Individuals who have undergone vasectomy should be informed of the need to use additional contraception until sterility is confirmed. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Individuals who have undergone hysteroscopic sterilisation with micro-inserts should be informed of the need to use additional contraception until sterility is confirmed. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regret</strong></p>
<p>Additional care must be taken when counselling individuals under the age of 30 years or individuals without children who request sterilisation. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Regret Associated with the Timing of Female Sterilisation</strong></p>
<p>If tubal occlusion is performed at the same time as a caesarean section, counselling and agreement should be given at least 2 weeks in advance of the procedure. (<strong>Grade C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Vasectomy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anaesthesia</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Vasectomy should be performed under local anaesthesia wherever possible. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consideration may be given to warming local anaesthetic to approximately 37&amp;deg;C before infiltration to reduce pain associated with injection. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Local anaesthetic with or without adrenaline (epinephrine) can be used during vasectomy (outside product licence for bupivacaine with adrenaline). (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Local anaesthetic should be administered via infiltration of the subcuticular tissue and by direct injection to the vas deferens. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Local anaesthetic should be administered using a fine-gauge needle to reduce pain. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exposing and Identifying the Vas Deferens</strong></p>
<p>A minimally invasive approach should be used to expose and isolate the vas deferens during vasectomy, as this approach results in fewer early complications in comparison to other methods. (<strong>Grade A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Interruption of the Vas Deferens in Vasectomy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cauterisation followed by division of the vas deferens, with or without excision, is associated with the lowest likelihood of early recanalisation (failure) when compared to other occlusion techniques. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Division of the vas on its own is not an acceptable technique because of the associated failure rate. It should be accompanied by diathermy or ligation and fascial interposition. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Clips are not recommended for occluding the vas deferens as their use is associated with a potentially high failure rate when compared to other occlusion methods. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Histological Examination</strong></p>
<p>Routine histological examination of the excised portions of vas deferens is no longer recommended. (<strong>Grade C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Post-vasectomy Semen Analysis</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA) should be carried out to identify early failure. Additional contraception should be used until azoospermia is confirmed or special clearance given. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evidence suggests that 12 weeks post-vasectomy is the optimal timing to schedule the first PVSA. Earlier or later testing is acceptable taking into account that earlier testing increases the probability of additional tests and later testing prolongs the need for additional contraception. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Postal semen samples can be used for PVSA; however, such samples will not be suitable for the assessment of sperm motility. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Packaging and labelling of postal samples should conform to local laboratory policy/requirements and must comply with Royal Mail standards for the posting of biological specimens. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>A routine second PVSA is not required if azoospermia is found in the first sample. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In a small proportion of men non-motile sperm will persist following vasectomy. In such cases special clearance can be given to cease using additional contraception when less than 100 000 non-motile sperm/ml are observed in a fresh semen sample post-vasectomy. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>If motile sperm are observed in a fresh sample 7 months post-procedure, the vasectomy should be considered a failure. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>If more than 100 000 non-motile sperm/ml are observed in a fresh sample 7 months after vasectomy, clinical judgement and/or local protocols may be used to determine whether or not the procedure should be deemed a failure. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Routine irrigation of the vas deferens does not reduce time to achieve azoospermia and is not recommended. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Centrifugation is not recommended for establishing the absence of sperm post-vasectomy and may interfere with evaluation of sperm motility. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intraoperative Complications</strong></p>
<p><em>Identification of the Vas Deferens</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>If a vas deferens cannot be palpated or located, unilateral vasectomy can be carried out following appropriate counselling, and the man advised to comply with additional contraception until sterility is confirmed. These men should be informed of the probability of ipsilateral renal agenesis and may be referred for renal ultrasound. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Where apparent bilateral absence of the vas deferens is encountered, men should be referred to a urology specialist. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>If a double or duplicate vas deferens is encountered or suspected, a Doppler ultrasound should be used to determine whether it is a &quot;true&quot; double vas or an ectopic ureter. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Where an anomaly of the vas deferens is suspected, the need for further investigation should be individually assessed by a urology specialist. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bleeding</em></p>
<p>Health professionals should cauterise or suture any bleeding perivasal and subdermal blood vessels to ensure haemostasis.&amp;nbsp;(<strong>GPP</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Pain</em></p>
<p>If pain is experienced during vasectomy, health professionals should consider the administration of additional anaesthesia/analgesia. (<strong>GPP</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Vasovagal Response</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should ensure that the clinical room is well ventilated and a comfortable temperature. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals can consider playing music in the clinical room if the patient wishes, as listening to music has been shown to reduce patient anxiety. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should engage men undergoing vasectomy in conversation and provide reassurance over the course of the procedure. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Immediate and Delayed Postoperative Complications</strong></p>
<p><em>Infection</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended prior to vasectomy. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Skin cleansing in advance of vasectomy should be undertaken in accordance with local infection control protocols. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>The decision to shave the scrotum prior to vasectomy should be based on local infection control/preoperative policies. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Early Failure</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should modify their technique if overall failure attributable to technical failure, recanalisation and non-compliance with additional contraception is more than 1%. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The incidence of bleeding, haematoma formation and infection is low and can be further reduced by the adoption of minimally invasive vasectomy techniques. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-term Complications</strong></p>
<p><em>Late Failure</em></p>
<p>Individuals should be informed that vasectomy has an associated failure rate and that pregnancy can occur several years after vasectomy. The contraceptive failure rate should be quoted as approximately 1 in 2000 (0.05%) after clearance has been given. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Chronic Post-vasectomy Pain</em></p>
<p>Vasectomy is associated with a risk of postoperative testicular, scrotal, penile or lower abdominal pain that is rarely severe and chronic in some men. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Interventions for Chronic Post-vasectomy Pain</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and treatment to alleviate neuropathic pain are common first-line treatment options for chronic post-vasectomy pain (CPVP) and are preferable to surgical treatment, which involves the reversal of vasectomy. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgical interventions can be effective in alleviating CPVP, however permanent relief is not achieved in every case. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Prostate and Testicular Cancer</em></p>
<p>There is no evidence of an increase in testicular cancers associated with vasectomy. The weak association observed in some studies between vasectomy and prostatic cancer is unlikely to be causal. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Cardiovascular Disease</em></p>
<p>There is no evidence to support an association between vasectomy and cardiovascular disease. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Vasectomy Reversal</strong></p>
<p>Vasectomy reversal involves complex surgery that can result in high postoperative patency rates, but may not result in pregnancy or a return to fertility. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Tubal Occlusion</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach to the Fallopian Tubes</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Culdoscopy should not be used as a method of approach for sterilisation. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The laparoscopic approach to the fallopian tubes is quicker to perform and results in less minor morbidity compared to mini-laparotomy. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>All women should be informed of the risks associated with laparoscopy and when this may proceed to laparotomy. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In some cases laparoscopy/laparotomy may be contraindicated and consideration should be given to other methods. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Occlusion Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>Ligation</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Any effective surgical or mechanical method of tubal occlusion can be used when a minilaparotomy is the method of approach for an interval sterilisation. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>For postpartum sterilisation, both Filshie clips and modified Pomeroy technique are effective. Filshie clip application is quicker to perform. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mechanical Methods</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Mechanical occlusion of the fallopian tubes by Filshie clips should be the method of choice for laparoscopic tubal occlusion. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The routine use of more than one Filshie clip is not recommended. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anaesthesia and Analgesia</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Laparoscopic tubal occlusion can be performed using general, regional or local anaesthesia but general anaesthesia is routinely used in the UK for laparoscopic tubal occlusion. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Topical application of local anaesthesia to the fallopian tubes may be used whenever mechanical occlusive devices are being applied as short-term postoperative pain is reduced. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Postpartum and Post-abortion Sterilisation</strong></p>
<p>Tubal occlusion should be performed at an appropriate interval after pregnancy wherever possible. Should tubal occlusion be requested either postpartum or post-abortion, women should be made aware of the increased rate of regret and the possible increased failure rate. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Excluding Pregnancy Prior to Surgery</strong></p>
<p><em>Pregnancy Testing</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A pregnancy test must be performed before sterilisation to exclude the possibility of a preexisting pregnancy. However, a negative test result does not exclude the possibility of a luteal-phase pregnancy. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Tubal occlusion can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle, providing that the woman has a negative pregnancy test and is not at risk of luteal-phase pregnancy (no unprotected sexual intercourse [UPSI] in the past 3 weeks). If this is not the case, the procedure should be deferred and contraception used until at least 3 weeks from the last instance of UPSI. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Dilatation and Curettage</em></p>
<p>During tubal occlusion curettage should not be performed for the purpose of preventing luteal-phase pregnancy. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Stopping Contraception after Laparoscopic Tubal Occlusion</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is no evidence to support stopping combined hormonal contraception (CHC) use prior to sterilisation or to support the routine use of thromboprophylaxis. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women using CHC, the progestogen-only pill (POP) or non-hormonal contraception should be advised to continue their contraceptive method for at least 7 days after laparoscopic sterilisation. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>If laparoscopic sterilisation is scheduled for the hormone-free interval or Day 1 of a cycle of CHC, the hormone-free interval should be omitted or CHC should be restarted, and CHC should be continued for at least 7 days after sterilisation. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>If the progestogen-only injectable or implant is being used, laparoscopic tubal occlusion can be carried out at any time during the period of licensed use without the need for additional contraception. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The progestogen-only implant can be removed at the time of the procedure or any time following laparoscopic tubal occlusion. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>If a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) or levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is <em>in situ</em> prior to sterilisation, this should be retained and removed at least 1 week after laparoscopic tubal occlusion. (<strong>Grade</strong> <strong>C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Failure of Tubal Occlusion</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Late failures resulting in a pregnancy can occur any time after tubal occlusion. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The lifetime risk of laparoscopic tubal occlusion failure, using a mix of occlusion methods, is estimated to be 1 in 200. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The longest period of available follow-up data for the most commonly used method in the UK, the Filshie clip, suggests a failure rate of 2&amp;ndash;3 per 1000 procedures at 10 years. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ectopic Pregnancy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Women should be informed that if tubal occlusion fails, the resulting pregnancy may be ectopic. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women should be informed about symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, and the possibility of ectopic pregnancy should be considered in women who have undergone sterilisation and present with abdominal pain, especially in connection with missed periods. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Hysteroscopic Sterilisation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anaesthesia and Analgesia for Hysteroscopic Sterilisation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of oral NSAIDs or intravenous sedation for hysteroscopic sterilisation. The use of such pharmacological agents should be based on clinical judgement. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Local anaesthesia is not routinely required prior to hysteroscopic sterilisation as it does not alleviate pain associated with the placement of micro-inserts into the fallopian tubes. However, local anaesthesia should be used when dilatation of the cervix is necessary to aid passage of the hysteroscope into the uterine cavity. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insertion of the Micro-inserts</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The incidence of unsuccessful placement of intra-fallopian implants is reported as ranging between 0% and 19%, following up to two attempts in an outpatient setting. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The likelihood of successful micro-insert placement is increased if the procedure is scheduled during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should undergo a period of supervised training to become proficient in the hysteroscopic insertion of micro-inserts. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Following sterilisation via hysteroscopy and the insertion of intra-fallopian micro-inserts, additional contraception must be used until either successful insert placement and/or tubal occlusion are confirmed, depending upon the confirmatory test employed. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Hysteroscopic sterilisation may be safely and effectively undertaken when intrauterine contraception is already <em>in situ</em> (outside the terms of the manufacturer's instructions for use). Women should be advised to use additional contraception or abstain from intercourse for 7 days before the procedure in case the intrauterine device needs to be removed to gain access to the fallopian tubes. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intraoperative Complications with Tubal Micro-inserts</strong></p>
<p>Hysteroscopic sterilisation via the placement of intra-fallopian micro-inserts is associated with a low level of intraoperative complications in a minority of patients. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Postoperative Complications of Hysteroscopic Sterilisation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Hysteroscopic sterilisation via the placement of intra-fallopian micro-inserts is associated with a low level of postoperative complications. The majority of post-procedural adverse events are self-limiting, with most women able to return to daily activities 1&amp;ndash;2 days following the procedure. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Hysteroscopic sterilisation with micro-inserts is contraindicated if there is documented proven patch test for nickel allergy. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-procedure Imaging Following Micro-insert Placement</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A confirmatory imaging test should be undertaken 3 months after the insertion of intra-fallopian micro-inserts. This may be via X-ray or transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVUSS) in the first instance, followed by hysterosalpingogram (HSG) in selected patients where X-ray/TVUSS cannot confirm satisfactory placement. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>HSG should be used as a first-line test where the hysteroscopic procedure was considered suboptimal, according to local protocols. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>HSG can be used as a routine test to confirm tubal occlusion following insertion of intra-fallopian micro-inserts. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women who do not attend for confirmatory testing should be informed that they need to continue using additional contraception until tubal occlusion is confirmed. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training Issues in Post-procedure Imaging of Micro-inserts</strong></p>
<p>Training in interpretation and performance of confirmatory imaging techniques specifically for sterilisation using Essure is essential, as a number of pregnancies have been attributed to the misinterpretation of images. (<strong>GPP</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Efficacy of Micro-inserts</strong></p>
<p>Available evidence suggests that tubal occlusion by intra-fallopian micro-insert has a low associated failure rate of approximately 1 in 500 at 5 years of follow-up; this includes cases where luteal-phase pregnancy or non-adherence with post-procedural instructions was documented. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Patient Satisfaction with Hysteroscopic Sterilisation</strong></p>
<p>Available evidence suggests that the use of intra-fallopian micro-inserts for tubal occlusion is a procedure that is well tolerated by the majority of women and results in good long-term satisfaction in terms of comfort and tolerance of the insert. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Hysteroscopic Sterilisation and Other Procedures</strong></p>
<p><em>Endometrial Ablation</em></p>
<p>Limited available evidence suggests that intra-fallopian micro-insert insertion can be carried out in combination with endometrial ablation. (<strong>Grade C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Long-term Complications of Female Sterilisation</strong></p>
<p><em>Ovarian Cancer</em></p>
<p>Tubal occlusion is not associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Evidence suggests that the procedure may have a protective effect against developing ovarian cancer that persists over time. (<strong>Grade A</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Breast Cancer</em></p>
<p>There is no available evidence of an association between tubal occlusion and breast cancer risk. (<strong>Grade A</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Cervical and Endometrial Cancer</em></p>
<p>Available evidence suggests that there is no association between tubal occlusion and cervical or endometrial cancer risk. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Menstrual and Gynaecological Symptoms</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is no evidence that tubal occlusion results in significant changes to hormone levels. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evidence suggests that there is an association between tubal occlusion and an increased risk of subsequent hysterectomy but there is no evidence of causation. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women may report worsening menstrual symptoms following tubal occlusion but there is no evidence to suggest a causal effect. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Female Sterilisation Reversal</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Fallopian tube re-anastomosis following sterilisation can result in high postoperative patency rates, but may not result in pregnancy or a return to fertility. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>To date, reversal of sterilisation with micro-inserts cannot be achieved via fallopian re-anastomosis, therefore consideration should be given to <em>in vitro</em> fertilisation. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A number of case reports were identified that reported vas deferens anomalies as a potential intraoperative complication of vasectomy. </li>
    <li>Excessive bleeding may also occur as an intraoperative complication of vasectomy. </li>
    <li>Immediate and delayed postoperative complications:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Bleeding and haematoma </li>
        <li>Infection </li>
        <li>Early failure </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Long-term complications:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Late failure </li>
        <li>Chronic post-vasectomy pain </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A single, small-scale, case-control study was identified which reported that vasectomy may&amp;nbsp;be associated with primary progressive aphasia, a form of dementia, due to autoimmune reactions (i.e., anti-sperm antibodies). However, a recently published study did not observe such an association. </li>
    <li>While there are no recognised risk factors for urolithiasis (renal stones) attributable to vasectomy, two studies suggest that there is a higher incidence of urolithiasis in men who had a vasectomy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tubal Occlusion Procedures</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Major complications associated with laparoscopic surgery are injuries to the bowel, bladder and blood vessels that require laparotomy. </li>
    <li>Studies that examined the placement of the Essure micro-insert have reported a low level of intraoperative complications, such as vasovagal response and pain during the procedure. </li>
    <li>Postoperative complications of hysteroscopic sterilisation that were reported as affecting a minority of patients include nausea, stomach cramps, dyspareunia, urinary tract infection, nickel allergy, vaginal discharge and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). </li>

        <li>Uncertainty about ending fertility </li>
        <li>Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy </li>

        <li>Unexplained or severe vaginal bleeding </li>
        <li>Known or suspected gynaecological malignancy </li>
        <li>Known abnormal uterine cavity or fallopian tubes that impairs visualisation of the tubal ostia or that makes cannulation of the proximal fallopian tube difficult/impossible </li>
        <li>Allergy to contrast media used for hysterosalpingogram (HSG) </li>
        <li>Women taking corticosteroids </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hysteroscopic sterilisation with micro-inserts is contraindicated if there is documented proven patch test for nickel allergy. </li>
    <li>Local anaesthesia is contraindicated when there is a history of an allergy to local anaesthetic&amp;nbsp;and/or the presence of a medical co-morbidity where it is clinically inappropriate to use a local anaesthetic. </li>
    <li>Contraindications for laparoscopy can include diabetes mellitus or other medical disease. </li>
