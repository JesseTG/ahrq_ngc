	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the quality of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low, very low</strong>) and strength of recommendation (<strong>strong, weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Is antiviral prophylaxis needed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients who will undergo immunosuppressive drug therapy? </li>
    <li>Is antiviral prophylaxis needed for HBsAg-negative, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)-positive patients who will undergo immunosuppressive drug therapy?
    <p>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommends antiviral prophylaxis over no prophylaxis for patients at high risk undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy. (<strong>Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    <p><em>Comments</em>: Treatment should be continued for at least 6 months after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy (at least 12 months for B cell-depleting agents).</p>
    <p>The AGA suggests antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring for patients at moderate risk undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy. (<strong>Weak recommendation; Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    <p><em>Comments</em>: Treatment should be continued for 6 months after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. Patients who place a higher value on avoiding long-term use of antiviral therapy and the cost associated with its use and a lower value on avoiding the small risk of reactivation (particularly in those who are HBsAg negative) may reasonably select no prophylaxis over antiviral prophylaxis.</p>
    <p>The AGA suggests against routinely using antiviral prophylaxis in patients undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy who are at low risk for hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr). (<strong>Weak recommendation; Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>Does the presence of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen in addition to anti-HBc in HBsAg-negative patients confer additional protection against HBVr?
    <p>The AGA suggests against using anti-HBs status to guide antiviral prophylaxis for all risk groups. (<strong>Weak recommendation; Very low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>Is prophylactic treatment with third-generation nucleos(t)ide analogues more effective than first- or second-generation nucleos(t)ide agents?
    <p>The AGA suggests use of antiviral drugs with a high barrier to resistance over lamivudine for prophylaxis in patients undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy. (<strong>Weak recommendation; Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    <p><em>Comments</em>: Given the geographic variability in cost of antiviral therapy, those patients who put a higher value on cost and a lower value on avoiding the potentially small risk of resistance development (particularly in those who have an undetectable viral load and who are expected to use antiviral prophylaxis for &amp;le;6 months) may reasonably select the least expensive antiviral hepatitis B medication over more expensive antiviral drugs with a higher barrier to resistance.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Is HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) monitoring followed by on-demand antiviral therapy as effective as prophylactic antiviral therapy?
    <p>The AGA makes no recommendation for a strategy of HBV DNA monitoring followed by rescue treatment as an alternative to antiviral prophylaxis. (<strong>No recommendation &amp;ndash; knowledge gap</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>Is treatment of established HBVr with third-generation nucleos(t)ide agents more effective than first- or second-generation drugs?
    <p>The AGA recommends antiviral drugs with a high barrier to resistance over lamivudine for established HBVr in patients undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy. (<strong>Strong recommendation; Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>
    <li>Should patients who will undergo long-term immunosuppressive drug therapy be screened for HBV before starting treatment?
    <p>The AGA recommends screening for HBV (HBsAg and anti-HBc, followed by a sensitive HBV DNA test if positive) in patients at moderate or high risk who will undergo immunosuppressive drug therapy. (<strong>Strong recommendation; Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    <p>The AGA suggests against routinely screening for HBV in patients who will undergo immunosuppressive drug therapy and are at low risk. (<strong>Weak recommendation; Moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
    <p><em>Comments</em>: Patients in populations with a baseline prevalence likely exceeding 2% for chronic HBV should be screened according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>An information specialist developed a literature search with input from the authors. All search results were imported using bibliographic management software for de‐duplication and title and abstract screening. The following bibliographic databases were searched through the Ovid interface: EBM Reviews; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (July 2013); Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (July 2005 to July 2013); Health Technology Assessment (3rd quarter EMB); EMBASE 1980 to 2013 week 35; Ovid MEDLINE. The reviewers applied a search filter for systematic reviews, meta‐analyses, and health technology assessments for the questions on the use of antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>The primary search was accessed in July to September of 2013 and included all articles up to 1998 that were using the search terms of hepatitis B, HBV reactivation, anti‐HBc, rituximab, immunosuppressive therapy, cancer chemotherapy, biologic modifiers, antiviral prophylaxis, lamivudine, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir (see Appendix 1 in the technical review for search strategy [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The initial search revealed 744 publications and their corresponding titles and abstracts. The authors discarded 606 publications by sequentially examining the titles and then abstracts, and if applicable, after full text articles were retrieved. Reasons for exclusion were inappropriate content such as relevance to solid organ transplantation or antiviral therapy in cohorts who were not taking immune suppressive drug therapy. The reviewers also excluded articles dealing with bone marrow transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to the greater awareness of reactivation risk status and treatment policy in both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)‐positive and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)‐positive patients. Case reports, abstracts or conference proceedings were not preferred and were only used when there was a marked paucity of data. The remaining 98 references were sorted according to whether they would provide useful information to assess the individual Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) questions (see Appendix 2 in the technical review for trial flow diagram).</p>
<p>Major databases such as MEDLINE and conference reports were also searched by the authors for studies which addressed the baseline risk for hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) and outcomes of interest in defined populations. Prevalence studies were not included in the final analysis of data if they did not provide reasonable evidence for consecutive case reporting, if baseline HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) data were unavailable, or if the study lacked definable criteria by which reactivation could be diagnosed. Editorials and letters were deselected as were all observational studies in which it was thought that the study design could lead to an unacceptable level of confounding either in the diagnosis of reactivation or in the assessment of outcomes due to antiviral therapy.</p></div>"/>

<p>The authors systematically reviewed and partitioned the evidence for each outcome across studies, assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome, and then presented the evidence to answer each specific Patient Intervention Comparative Outcome (PICO) question. The quality of the evidence was classified into 4 Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) categories: high, moderate, low and very low and a summary of the evidence was documented in GRADE evidence profiles using the GRADEpro software. According to GRADE criteria, evidence from randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) would start at high quality but rated down in the presence of serious risk of bias, inconsistency or heterogeneity, indirectness, imprecision and potential publication bias. Evidence from observational studies would start at low quality but were eligible to be rated up in the presence of large effect size. Observational studies were considered to be primarily helpful in the determination of baseline risk for hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) and providing additional information on patient outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Extraction of Data and Analytic Approach</strong></p>
<p>Numerator and denominator for each critical and important outcome were extracted from each study using pre‐tested data extraction sheets listing acceptable definitions for outcomes such as HBVr, hepatitis, liver failure, liver‐related mortality and chemotherapy interruptions. When possible, pooled risk ratio (RR) was calculated for each outcome using the Mantel‐Haenszel random effect model in RevMan 5.2. Funnel plots were inspected for heterogeneity in addition to formal analysis of heterogeneity (chisquare, p&amp;lt;0.1) and residual heterogeneity that was not explained by chance (I‐squared). The number of studies were insufficient to formally test for funnel plot asymmetry to detect possible publication bias. As relative effects of interventions usually are stable across differing baseline risks, the reviewers initially pooled the results of all RCTs using antiviral regimens vs. placebo from different populations and different antiviral regimens (see Figure 1 in the technical review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). As relative effects appeared similar and little or no heterogeneity across studies were seen, a decision was made to apply the pooled relative effects to typical baseline risks from different populations (those that were seen in the included RCTs, but also from clinical settings where baseline risks were not available directly from RCTs) to arrive at representative risk differences that would be most suitable to inform clinical guidance.</p>
<p>As well done cohort studies from well‐defined populations (e.g., cancer or rheumatic disease populations) may provide accurate estimates of baseline risks of HBV reactivation, and the risk of reactivation is markedly different based on the patient's baseline HBV serologies, a comprehensive review of those prevalence rates, mostly from observational studies, was performed. When pooled estimates of baseline risk were obtained from untreated control arms of RCTs in addition to well‐done cohort studies that enrolled consecutive, untreated patients, baseline risk was transformed to natural log proportions and pooled using the fixed effects inverse variance method in OpenMeta[analyst].</p>

<p>The guideline was developed using a process outlined in the technical review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Briefly, the AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and best practices as outlined by the Institute of Medicine. GRADE methodology was used to prepare the background information for the guideline and the technical review that accompanies it (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). Optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review.</p>
<p>Four members of the guideline panel, along with AGA support staff, met in person with the authors of the technical review on May 31, 2014. The information in the technical review was discussed in a systematic manner, facilitating subsequent creation of the guideline recommendations for or against each intervention. The strength of each recommendation was also rated as either strong or weak (i.e., conditional).</p>
<p><strong>Formulation of Patient Intervention Comparative Outcome (PICO) Questions</strong></p>
<p>PICO questions were devised by the authors and approved for further study by the AGA governing board in July of 2013. Each PICO question asks if an intervention affects patient outcomes in a positive or negative way and each independently required a careful and coordinated search of the medical literature as described above (see Table 1 in the technical review). The following clinical outcomes were considered critical or important for decision making: 1) Severity of hepatitis; 2) disease morbidity, 3) resource utilization including the need for hospitalization; 4) liver related mortality; and 3) interruption of cancer chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive drug treatment (see Table 1 in the technical review).</p></div>"/>
