	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Nutrition, Behavior, and Gastrointestinal</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;32&quot;>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that weight-for-age be maintained at &amp;ge;10th percentile. (<strong>Grade: A; Certainty: High; Benefit: Substantial</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends weight-for-stature assessments use the body mass index (BMI)% method on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts and a BMI &amp;ge;50th percentile be maintained. (<strong>Grade: B; Certainty: High; Benefit: Moderate</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, who are meeting optimal nutritional thresholds, the CF Foundation recommends &amp;ge;90&amp;ndash;110 kcal/kg per day and protein intake based on dietary reference intakes and dietary guidelines recommendations: &amp;ge;13 g protein/day 2&amp;ndash;3-year-old, &amp;ge;19 g protein/day 4&amp;ndash;5-year-old. (<strong>Grade: A; Certainty: High; Benefit: Substantial</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nutritional Risk</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;35&quot;>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends evaluation and more intensive management of children demonstrating any of these criteria of nutritional risk:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>BMI &amp;lt;50th percentile, or rate of weight gain &amp;lt;50th percentile expected for age (&amp;ge;6 g/d), or weight-for-age &amp;lt;10th percentile, or inappropriate weight loss (<strong>Grade: B; Certainty: High; Benefit: Moderate</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and at nutritional risk, the CF Foundation recommends patients be seen in 8 weeks or sooner. These visits should include medical, behavioral, and nutritional assessment; education; and intervention. Nutritional intervention should aim at achieving the patient's target goal for both weight-for-age and BMI. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and at nutritional risk, the CF Foundation recommends energy intake 10% to 20% above baseline with continued incremental upward adjustments of 10% to 20% as needed up to 200% to achieve weight gain. (<strong>Grade: B; Certainty: Moderate; Benefit: Moderate</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and at nutritional risk, the CF Foundation recommends the use of oral nutrition supplements, in addition to usual dietary intake, to improve rate of weight gain. (<strong>Grade: B; Certainty: Moderate; Benefit: Moderate</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, at nutritional risk who do not respond to previously described nutritional interventions, see Figure 2, the CF Foundation recommends an expanded evaluation to consider other causes of poor growth, including gastrointestinal, endocrine, behavioral, and social causes. Subspecialty consultation may be considered. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, at nutritional risk who do not respond to standard nutritional intervention and who have not responded to the evaluation and management plan of the multidisciplinary team, the CF Foundation recommends the use of enteral nutritional supplements via a feeding tube to improve the rate of weight gain. The concept of enteral feedings should be introduced early as a component of CF care. (<strong>Grade: B; Certainty: Moderate; Benefit: Moderate</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Vitamins</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;41&quot;>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends standard, age-appropriate non&amp;ndash;fat-soluble vitamins and the recommended levels of vitamins A, D, E, and K by using a fat-soluble vitamin supplement formulated for children with CF and if indicated based on levels, additional supplementation of vitamins A, D, E, and K. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that blood levels of fat-soluble vitamins be measured annually. If values are abnormal, more frequent measurements after dose adjustment are recommended. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that management of vitamin D deficiency follow the treatment outlined in the CF Foundation Vitamin D guidelines: An Update on the Screening, Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency in Individuals with Cystic Fibrosis: Evidence-Based Recommendations from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2012. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;44&quot;>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends adding additional salt to meals and snacks, especially during the summer months and for those who live in warm climates. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT)</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;45&quot;>
    <li>For children with CF and pancreatic insufficiency (PI), ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that PERT be adjusted up to a dose of no greater than 2500 lipase units per kg per meal with a maximum daily dose of 10,000 lipase units/kg. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;46&quot;>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that the CF team members, working in concert with the family, set energy-intake goals and assess progress on a regular basis. (<strong>Grade: B; Certainty: Moderate Benefit: Substantial</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that all families are regularly assessed for the presence of mealtime behavior challenges and are provided with proactive behavioral assistance when needed. (<strong>Grade: A; Certainty: High; Benefit: Substantial</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, who are at nutritional risk, or exhibiting challenging mealtime behaviors, or not meeting energy intake goals, behavioral therapy provided by knowledgeable team members should accompany nutritional therapy. (<strong>Grade: A; Certainty: High; Benefit: Substantial</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;49&quot;>
    <li>The CF Foundation recommends that all providers be aware of the presenting symptoms of the following gastrointestinal tract disorders: constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, small bowel overgrowth, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and celiac disease. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that children and their parents be questioned regarding abdominal pain at each visit, and that pain is investigated if persistent or recurrent. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and who are pancreatic sufficient (PS), the CF Foundation recommends that children are reevaluated annually for the conversion to PI with fecal elastase measurement, particularly if genetic testing reveals 2 mutations potentially associated with PI. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and who are PS with severe abdominal pain, particularly if associated with vomiting, the CF Foundation recommends measurement of lipase and amylase to determine if pancreatitis is present. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, who had terminal ileal bowel resection, the CF Foundation recommends annual measurement of serum vitamin B12 concentration. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In January 2014, the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation convened a committee of 16 CF pediatric experts and parents to develop clinical care guidelines for preschool-aged children with CF. Committee members participated in 1 of 3 workgroups. Each group developed population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions, which were reviewed and approved by the wider committee. </p>
<p>In May 2014 the committee convened to review draft recommendation statements and supporting evidence. Unfortunately, the evidence is lacking for most treatments and monitoring tools in the 2- to 5-year-old age group. Whenever possible, statements were developed and graded by using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade definitions (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The committee decided to make recommendations for CF care that would guide both CF clinicians and primary care providers (PCPs). Therefore, questions for which evidence was limited or absent were then presented and discussed by committee members. Use of existing evidence from older children and adults, as well as clinical experience, was then used as the basis for consensus recommendations. An 80% approval by the committee was agreed on a priori, and required for all statements.</p></div>"/>
