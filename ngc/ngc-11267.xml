	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Is Patient Preparation, including Acupuncture, Relaxant, Sedation, or Antibiotics, Before Embryo Transfer Necessary and Does It Affect Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence that acupuncture performed around the time of embryo transfer does not improve live-birth rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF). (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Analgesics</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against analgesics to improve IVF-embryo transfer outcomes. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Anesthesia</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence that anesthesia during embryo transfer improves pregnancy rates. Given that there is no clear benefit and that there are inherent risks associated with anesthesia, routine anesthesia is not recommended to improve IVF-embryo transfer outcomes. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Massage</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against massage therapy to improve IVF-embryo transfer outcomes. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) improves IVF-embryo transfer (ET) outcomes (<strong>Grade B</strong>). However, given the lack of any other studies, a recommendation for or against TEAS to improve IVF-ET outcomes cannot be made. </p>
<p><strong>Whole-Systems Traditional Chinese Medicine (WS-TCM)</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against WS-TCM to improve IVF-embryo transfer outcomes. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Prophylactic Antibiotics</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on a single RCT that an antibiotic regimen that includes amoxicillin and clavulanic acid given on the day before and the day of embryo transfer does not improve pregnancy rates (<strong>Grade B</strong>). Given these results and the lack of other evidence in the literature to support prophylactic antibiotics at embryo transfer, a recommendation for routine prophylactic antibiotics cannot be made.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does Physician Preparation, Including the Use of Sterile Latex-free Gloves, Before an Embryo Transfer Procedure Affect Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on one, single-center RCT that powdered gloves worn during embryo transfer do not have an adverse effect on pregnancy rates. (<strong>Grade B</strong>). No specific type of glove is recommended for embryo transfer. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does Routine Use of Abdominal Ultrasound for Guidance During Embryo Transfer Improve Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is good evidence based on 10 RCTs to recommend TA ultrasound guidance during embryo transfer to improve clinical pregnancy rate and live-birth rate. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>While selected ultrasound guidance for an anticipated difficult embryo transfer may be an alternative to routine ultrasound guidance, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this practice. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does Removing Mucus from the Endocervical Canal Improve Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on one RCT and one prospective cohort study that there is a benefit to removing cervical mucus at the time of embryo transfer to improve clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does the Type of Catheter Used for Embryo Transfer Affect Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is good evidence to recommend the use of a soft embryo transfer catheter to improve IVF-embryo transfer pregnancy rates. (<strong>Grade A</strong>). Data on live-birth rates and specific types of soft catheters are limited. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does Positioning the Catheter at the Time of Embryo Transfer Affect IVF-Embryo Transfer Implantation, Pregnancy, and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is fair evidence based on six studies (two RCTs and four cohort studies) that embryo transfer catheter placement affects implantation and pregnancy rates. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence based on seven studies (three RCTs and four cohort studies) that placement of the catheter tip in the upper or middle (central) area of the uterine cavity, greater than 1 cm from the fundus for embryo expulsion, optimizes pregnancy rates. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence for more specific recommendations regarding the positioning of the catheter at the time of embryo transfer. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does the Time Interval before Withdrawing the Catheter Affect IVF-Embryo Transfer Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on one RCT and one cohort study to recommend immediate withdrawal of the embryo transfer catheter after embryo expulsion. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Is the Presence of Mucus on the Catheter (After It Is Removed) Associated with Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on seven cohort studies that the presence of mucus on the embryo transfer catheter, once it is withdrawn, is not associated with a lower clinical pregnancy rate or live-birth rate. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does the Presence of Blood on the Catheter (Once It Is Withdrawn) Make a Difference in Pregnancy or Live-birth Rate?</strong></span></p>

<p>Given the mixed results of studies, there is insufficient evidence to state conclusively that the presence of blood on the catheter, once it is withdrawn, is associated with implantation or pregnancy rates. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does the Rate of Injection of the Catheter Load Affect Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>Given the paucity of data, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific injection speed of the catheter at the time of embryo transfer. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Do Retained Embryos in the Transfer Catheter and Immediate Re-transfer of Them Affect Implantation, Clinical Pregnancy, or Spontaneous Abortion Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence based on the secondary outcome of one RCT, nine cohort studies, and one series that retained embryos in the transfer catheter and immediate re-transfer do not affect implantation, clinical pregnancy, or spontaneous abortion rates. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does Bed Rest or Ambulation Affect IVF-Embryo Transfer Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is good evidence not to recommend bed rest after embryo transfer. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Embryo transfer is considered a critical step in the IVF process. Extensive literature exists regarding all aspects of embryo transfer, which supports its importance to overall IVF success. While there are insufficient data to provide guidance on a number of techniques used during embryo transfer, the literature does provide guidance for many aspects of this critical component of IVF.</p>
<p>The following interventions are supported by the literature for improving pregnancy rates:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Abdominal ultrasound guidance for embryo transfer </li>
    <li>Removal of cervical mucus </li>
    <li>Use of soft embryo transfer catheters </li>
    <li>Placement of embryo transfer tip in the upper or middle (central) area of the uterine cavity, greater than 1 cm from the fundus, for embryo expulsion </li>
    <li>Immediate ambulation once the embryo transfer procedure is completed </li>
</ul>
<p>The following interventions have been shown not to be beneficial for improving pregnancy rates:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Acupuncture </li>
    <li>Analgesics, massage, general anesthesia, whole systems &amp;ndash; traditional Chinese medicine </li>
    <li>Prophylactic antibiotics to improve embryo transfer outcomes </li>
    <li>Waiting after expulsion of embryos for any specific period of time before withdrawing the embryo transfer catheter </li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened and reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Protocols and results of the studies were examined according to specific inclusion criteria. Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the final analysis. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: level I or II studies that assessed the effectiveness of a procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, implantation, or live-birth rates); meta-analyses; and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles. This guideline focuses principally on pregnancy rate since most of the studies report pregnancy rates rather than live-birth rates.</p>
<p>Three members of an independent task force reviewed the full articles of all citations that possibly matched the predefined selection criteria. Final inclusion or exclusion decisions were made on examination of the articles in full. Disagreements about inclusion among reviewers were discussed and solved by consensus or arbitration after consultation with an independent reviewer/epidemiologist.</p>

    <li>With regard to the transfer of fresh embryos in eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four cohort studies, transabdominal (TA) ultrasound&amp;mdash;guided embryo transfer was found to improve the implantation rate and/or pregnancy rate, clinical or ongoing clinical pregnancy rates, and/or live-birth rate. Studies have also shown improved outcomes using ultrasound guidance with frozen embryo transfer and programmed recipient cycles using donor eggs. </li>
    <li>One RCT showed improved clinical pregnancy rate and live-birth rate with the removal of cervical mucus. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group that had mucus aspiration compared with the group with no aspiration in the cohort study. </li>
    <li>The majority of the studies found that embryo placement impacted pregnancy rates, with pregnancy rates highest when the embryo was placed in the upper or middle area of the uterine cavity, at least 1 cm away from the fundus. </li>
    <li>The placement of the outer catheter may also affect pregnancy rates. In a cohort study of 408 patients who underwent embryo transfer, overall pregnancy rates were significantly better in those patients for whom the outer sheath did not go beyond the internal os compared with patients for whom the catheter was placed through the internal os. </li>
