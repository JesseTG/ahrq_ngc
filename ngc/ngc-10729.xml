	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should engage in a diagnostic process to document the signs and symptoms that characterize Peyronie's disease (PD). The minimum requirements for this examination are a careful history (to assess penile deformity, interference with intercourse, penile pain, and/or distress) and a physical exam of the genitalia (to assess for palpable abnormalities of the penis). (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should perform an in-office intracavernosal injection (ICI) test with or without duplex Doppler ultrasound prior to invasive intervention. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>The evaluation and treatment of a man with PD should be undertaken by a clinician who has the experience and expertise in the appropriate evaluation, counseling, and management of this condition and treatment complications.&amp;nbsp;(<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should discuss with patients the available treatment options and the known benefits and risks/burdens associated with each treatment. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications to the patient suffering from active PD who is in need of pain management. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not offer oral therapy with vitamin E, tamoxifen, procarbazine, omega-3 fatty acids, or a combination of vitamin E with L-carnitine. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong> [vitamin E/omega-3 fatty acids/vitamin E + propionyl-L-carnitine]/ <strong>C </strong>[tamoxifen/procarbazine]) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not offer electromotive therapy with verapamil. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may administer intralesional collagenase clostridium histolyticum in combination with modeling by the clinician and by the patient for the reduction of penile curvature in patients with stable PD, penile curvature &amp;gt;30&amp;deg; and &amp;lt;90&amp;deg;, and intact erectile function (with or without the use of medications). (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients with PD prior to beginning treatment with intralesional collagenase regarding potential occurrence of adverse events (AEs), including penile ecchymosis, swelling, pain, and corporal rupture. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may administer intralesional interferon &amp;alpha;-2b in patients with PD. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients with PD prior to beginning treatment with intralesional interferon &amp;alpha;-2b about potential AEs, including sinusitis, flu-like symptoms, and minor penile swelling. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer intralesional verapamil for the treatment of patients with PD. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients with PD prior to beginning treatment with intralesional verapamil about potential AEs, including penile bruising, dizziness, nausea, and pain at the injection site. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not use extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the reduction of penile curvature or plaque size. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer ESWT to improve penile pain. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not use radiotherapy (RT) to treat PD. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should assess patients as candidates for surgical reconstruction based on the presence of stable disease. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer tunical plication surgery to patients whose rigidity is adequate for coitus (with or without pharmacotherapy and/or vacuum device therapy) to improve penile curvature. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer plaque incision or excision and/or grafting to patients with deformities whose rigidity is adequate for coitus (with or without pharmacotherapy and/or vacuum device therapy) to improve penile curvature. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer penile prosthesis surgery to patients with PD with erectile dysfunction (ED) and/or penile deformity sufficient to prevent coitus despite pharmacotherapy and/or vacuum device therapy. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may perform adjunctive intra-operative procedures, such as modeling, plication or incision/grafting, when significant penile deformity persists after insertion of the penile prosthesis. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should use inflatable penile prosthesis for patients undergoing penile prosthetic surgery for the treatment of PD. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Body of Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: Well-conducted and highly-generalizable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies with consistent findings</p>
<p><strong>Grade B</strong>: RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or moderately strong observational studies with consistent findings</p>
<p><strong>Grade C</strong>: RCTs with serious deficiencies of procedure or generalizability or extremely small sample sizes or observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: By definition, Grade A evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a high level of certainty, Grade B evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a moderate level of certainty, and Grade C evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a low level of certainty.</p>

<p>A systematic review was conducted to identify published articles relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD). Literature searches were performed on English-language publications using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from 1/1/1965 to 1/26/2015. Data from studies published after the literature search cut-off will be incorporated into the next version of this guideline. Preclinical studies (e.g., animal models), commentary, and editorials were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were as follows: patients constituted a mixed group among which most patients had congenital curvature rather than PD, and outcomes were collapsed across groups; article focused primarily on surgical technique with minimal or no patient information or outcomes reported; no outcomes reported or outcomes data not extractable; or duplicate report of data presented elsewhere. Review article references were checked to ensure inclusion of all possibly relevant studies. Multiple reports on the same patient group were carefully examined to ensure inclusion of only non-redundant information.</p></div>"/>

<p>Data extraction for each study was performed by the methodologist using a standard template in a statistical spreadsheet. All key outcomes data were verified against the full-text article after the completion of extraction.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>A qualitative synthesis was performed of all studies. This synthesis is presented in the systematic review in text, tabular, and graphical formats and focuses on understanding study and patient characteristics that may be relevant to interpret outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quality of Individual Studies and Determination of Evidence Strength</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality of individual studies that were either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The quality of case-control studies and comparative observational studies was rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality (NOQ) Assessment Scale. Because there is no widely-agreed upon quality assessment tool for single cohort observational studies, the quality of these studies was not assessed.</p>
<p>The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies. Evidence strength refers to the body of evidence available for a particular question and includes not only individual study quality but consideration of study design, consistency of findings across studies, adequacy of sample sizes, and generalizability of samples, settings, and treatments for the purposes of the guideline. (See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence&quot; field.)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Limitations of the Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>The Panel proceeded with full awareness of the limitations of the Peyronie's disease (PD) literature. Some of these limitations derive from the fact that PD is characterized by symptoms that change over time and by some symptoms that may resolve in the absence of treatment (i.e., Berookhim 2014; Grasso 2007; Mulhall 2006). The changing nature of PD symptoms and the possibility that improvement in some patients may be a consequence of the passage of time makes the study of treatment effects challenging. Some symptoms, such as pain, are highly susceptible to placebo effects. These characteristics of PD make it difficult to interpret studies that do not control for the natural history of symptoms or for placebo effects (e.g., observational studies). In addition, because patients may have highly variable courses with or without treatment, findings from studies that have small sample sizes &amp;ndash; even well-designed studies &amp;ndash; potentially lack generalizability because of the inherent instability of findings derived from small numbers of patients. Further, the quality of any empirical literature depends on its capacity for accurate measurement. An additional complexity of the PD literature is that many studies rely on patient perceptions of changes in deformity and penile dimensions as primary outcomes. This approach is problematic because studies that have compared objective and subjective measures of deformity and penile dimensions report limited or no correspondence between these two methods (e.g., Bacal 2009; Hudak 2013; Matsushita 2014; Taylor &amp;amp; Levine 2008). Additional limitations include highly variable inclusion criteria across studies in terms of symptom severity and symptom duration.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This document was written by the Peyronie's Disease Guidelines Panel of the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA), which was created in 2013. The Practice Guidelines Committee (PGC) of the AUA selected the committee chair. Panel members were selected by the chair. Membership of the committee included representatives of urology, family medicine, clinical psychology, patient advocacy, and other clinicians with specific expertise on this disorder. The mission of the committee was to develop recommendations that are analysis-based or consensus-based, depending on Panel processes and available data, for optimal clinical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>AUA Nomenclature: Linking Statement Type to Evidence Strength</span></strong></p>
<p>The AUA nomenclature system explicitly links statement type to body of evidence strength, level of certainty, magnitude of benefit or risk/burdens, and the Panel's judgment regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>For some clinical issues, particularly diagnosis, there was little or no evidence from which to construct evidence-based statements. Where gaps in the evidence existed, the Panel provides guidance in the form of <em>Clinical Principles or Expert Opinion</em> with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion emerged.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is associated with frequent adverse events (AEs). These include localized petechial bleeding or bruising in from 5% to 90% of patients with most studies reporting rates of 50% or greater, urethral bleeding or transient hematuria in from 1.9% to 100% of patients with most studies reporting rates &amp;lt;10%, and minor ecchymosis in from 3.6% to 16% of patients. Importantly, although severe AEs are infrequent, the most common severe AE is pain &amp;ndash; reported in 1.9% to 4.0% of patients. </li>
    <li>Potential AEs of intralesional collagenase include penile ecchymosis, swelling, pain, and corporal rupture. </li>
    <li>Potential AEs of intralesional interferon &amp;alpha;-2b include sinusitis, flu-like symptoms, and minor penile swelling. </li>
    <li>Potential AEs of verapamil include penile bruising, dizziness, nausea, and pain at the injection site. </li>
    <li>AEs of procarbazine include gastric disturbances, nausea, anxiety, and headache. </li>
    <li>Forty-three study arms reported at least one category of AEs with tunical plication surgery. The number of studies that reported particular AEs and the ranges for those AEs are listed in Table 2 in the original guideline document. The incidence of serious AEs, such as hematoma requiring reoperation or major skin necrosis, was low. The most frequently-reported AE was the presence of palpable or painful sutures; of the eleven studies that reported this AE, eight of them reported rates &amp;gt;10%. </li>
    <li>The only AEs reported with plaque incision or excision and/or grafting by more than a few studies were hematoma rates reported by 12 studies (range 0 to 26%), with ten studies reporting rates &amp;lt;10%, and wound infection rates reported in 11 studies (range 0 to 9%), with eight studies reporting rates of 0%. </li>
    <li>Only half of the studies of penile prosthesis surgery reported data on post-operative infection rates. Five studies reported rates of 0%, seven studies reported rates of &amp;lt;3% and eleven studies reported rates ranging from 3.5 to 12.0%. One study (Rigaud &amp;amp; Berger 1995) reported a rate of 60%. Twenty-seven studies reported rates of infection that required surgical revision or prosthesis explant. Fifteen studies reported rates of 0 to 3%. Eleven studies reported rates between 3.4% and 16.7%. Rigaud &amp;amp; Berger (1995) reported a rate of 40%. Revision rates for mechanical failure were reported by nineteen studies. Other AEs associated with surgery, such as urethral laceration, urethral erosion, or hematoma, were addressed by five or fewer of the prosthetic surgery studies. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>This guideline's purpose is to provide direction to clinicians and patients regarding how to recognize Peyronie's disease (PD), conduct a valid diagnostic process, and approach treatment with the goals of maximizing symptom control, sexual function, and patient and partner quality of life (QoL) while minimizing adverse events (AEs) and patient and partner burden. The strategies and approaches recommended in this guideline were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes. There is a continually expanding literature on PD; the Panel notes that this document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient in the context of that patient's history, values, and goals for treatment. As the science relevant to PD evolves and improves, the strategies presented here will be amended to remain consistent with the highest standards of clinical care. </li>
    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not preempt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses (&quot;off label&quot;) that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not intended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
