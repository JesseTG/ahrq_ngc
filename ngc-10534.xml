	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Key Question 25</strong></p>
<p>In patients with SCD undergoing surgical procedures, does a particular perioperative transfusion approach (simple or exchange transfusion to achieve a predetermined hemoglobin level or percentage of sickle hemoglobin [HbS]) reduce perioperative mortality and complications?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In adults and children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), transfuse red blood cells (RBCs) to bring the hemoglobin level to 10 g/dL prior to undergoing a surgical procedure involving general anesthesia. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS) disease who require surgery and who already have a hemoglobin level higher than 8.5 g/dL without transfusion, are on chronic hydroxyurea therapy, or who require high-risk surgery (e.g., neurosurgery, prolonged anesthesia, cardiac bypass), consult a sickle cell expert for guidance as to the appropriate transfusion method. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In adults and children with hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) or HbS&amp;beta;<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia, consult a sickle cell expert to determine if full or partial exchange transfusion is indicated before a surgical procedure involving general anesthesia. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>

<p><strong>Key Question 26</strong></p>
<p>In patients with SCA who require RBC transfusion, what are the most effective transfusion protocols that reduce transfusion complications (including a transfusion goal, phenotype-matching monitoring approaches, procedures, or strategies)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>RBC units that are to be transfused to individuals with SCD should include matching for C, E, and K antigens. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with SCA, who are not chronically transfused and who are therefore at risk for hyperviscosity due to high percentages of circulating HbS-containing erythrocytes, avoid transfusing to a target hemoglobin above 10 g/dL. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In chronically transfused children with SCA, the goal of transfusion should be to maintain a HbS level of below 30 percent immediately prior to the next transfusion. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The expert panel recommends that clinicians prescribing chronic transfusion therapy follow an established monitoring protocol. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Protocol for Monitoring Individuals on Chronic Transfusion Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The following is a consensus protocol for the initiation and monitoring of patients on chronic transfusion therapy. It is understood that the recommended testing schedule may not be available to patients everywhere; therefore, this protocol should serve only as a helpful guide for transfusion management.</p>
<p><strong>At Initiation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Obtain patient treatment history to include locations where prior transfusions were received and any adverse effects. </li>
    <li>Notify the blood bank that the patient being initiated on chronic transfusion therapy has SCD. Ask the blood bank to contact hospitals where the patient reported receiving previous transfusion therapy to obtain transfusion information. </li>
    <li>Obtain a RBC phenotype, type and screen, quantitative measurement of percent normal hemoglobin (HbA) and percent HbS, complete blood count (CBC), and reticulocyte count. </li>
    <li>Inform the patient if he or she is alloimmunized, so that this information can be communicated as part of the patient's self-reported medical history. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested Evaluation Before Each Transfusion</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>CBC and reticulocyte count&amp;mdash;This procedure is done to help guide the frequency and volume of transfusions. It is expected that, with effective chronic transfusion therapy, the patient's bone marrow will be suppressed and the reticulocyte count should decrease, but the value may rise by the time of the next transfusion. </li>
    <li>Quantitative measurement of percent HbA and percent HbS&amp;mdash;This procedure is done to confirm the success of chronic transfusion therapy with achieving the target percent of HbS. </li>
    <li>Type and screen&amp;mdash;This is done to assess whether the patient has developed any new RBC antibodies from the prior transfusion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested Periodic Evaluations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Liver function tests annually or semiannually&amp;mdash;These tests are done to follow liver function in individuals with iron overload. </li>
    <li>Serum ferritin (SF) quarterly&amp;mdash;This test is done to follow iron stores in individuals with iron overload; it can be helpful in evaluating compliance with chelation. </li>
    <li>Screening for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) annually. </li>
    <li>Evaluation for iron overload every 1&amp;ndash;2 years by validated liver iron quantification methods such as liver biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) R2 or MRI T2* or R2* techniques. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Complications of Transfusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 27</strong></p>
<p>In patients with SCD requiring transfusion, what are the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of alloimmunization or autoimmunization?</p>
<p><strong>Key Question 28</strong></p>
<p>In patients with SCD undergoing chronic transfusion therapy, what are the effective strategies to reduce iron overload, and what are the most accurate diagnostic tests to estimate iron overload?</p>
<p><strong>Key Question 29</strong></p>
<p>In patients with SCD undergoing transfusion therapy, what are the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of hemolysis?</p>
<p><strong>Key Question 30</strong></p>
<p>In patients with SCD undergoing transfusion therapy, what are the most effective strategies to prevent and treat transfusion-associated hyperviscosity?</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations for the Management and Prevention of Transfusion Complications</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Both Children and Adults</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Obtain patient transfusion history to include locations of prior transfusions and adverse effects. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ask the blood bank to contact hospitals where patient reported receiving previous transfusion therapy to obtain transfusion information. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>RBC units that are to be transfused to individuals with SCD should include matching for C, E, and K antigens. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consult the blood bank for a workup of a possible delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) in a patient with any of the following signs or symptoms: acute anemia, pain, or jaundice within 3 weeks after a blood transfusion. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with SCA who are not chronically transfused and who are therefore at risk for hyperviscosity, avoid transfusing to a target hemoglobin above 10 g/dL (unless the patients are already on chronic transfusions or have low percent HbS levels). (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients who receive chronic transfusion therapy, perform serial assessment of iron overload to include validated liver iron quantification methods such as liver biopsy, or MRI R2 or MRI T2* and R2* techniques. The optimal frequency of assessment has not been established and will be based in part on the individual patient's characteristics. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Administer iron chelation therapy, in consultation with a hematologist, to patients with SCD and with documented transfusion-acquired iron overload. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as &quot;consensus.&quot; Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with SCD presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>General Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Due to the comprehensive scope of the guidelines, the search strategies for the systematic reviews were designed to have high sensitivity and low specificity; hence, the strategies were often derived from population and condition terms (e.g., people with sickle cell disease [SCD] who have priapism) and not restricted or combined with outcome or intervention terms. To be inclusive of the available literature in the field, searches included randomized trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Case reports and small case series were included only when outcomes involved harm (e.g., the adverse effects of hydroxyurea) or when rare complications were expected to be reported.</p>
<p>Literature searches involved multiple databases (e.g., Medline&amp;reg; In-Process &amp;amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE&amp;reg;, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL&amp;reg;], TOXLINE&amp;reg;, and Scopus) and used controlled vocabulary (prespecified) terms supplemented with keywords to define concept areas.</p>
<p>An updated search was performed to span the time from June 1, 2010 through July 11, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline-specific Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive study of several databases was conducted, and all human studies in English published from 1970 to July 2010 that addressed each Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study Design (PICOS) question were identified. In some cases in this guideline, a literature search was not conducted or the search yielded no evidence (e.g., management of hyperviscosity), so the expert panel relied on their cumulative expertise and knowledge to make recommendations; these recommendations are labeled &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise.&quot;</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>General Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Methodologists developed evidence tables to summarize individual study findings and present the quality of evidence (i.e., confidence in the estimates of effect). The tables included descriptions of study population, sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes, interventions, and outcomes. Additional methodological details are discussed in each evidence table, including the search question, search strategy, study selection process, and list of excluded studies (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Framework</strong></p>
<p>The methodology team used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to grade the quality of evidence, and, in concert with the panel, determine the strength of recommendations. The GRADE framework is accepted by more than 75 national and international organizations (see exhibit 3 in the original guideline document). It provides the advantages of: (a) separately judging the quality of supporting evidence and strength of recommendations, and (b) incorporating factors other than evidence in decisionmaking (e.g., the balance of benefits and harms; the perceived values and preferences of those with SCD; resources; and clinical and social context). GRADE emphasizes the use of patient-important outcomes (i.e., outcomes that affect the way patients feel, function, or survive) over laboratory and physiologic outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Determining Evidence Quality</strong></p>
<p>In the GRADE framework, the quality of evidence (in this case, the body of evidence) is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The quality of evidence derived from randomized trials starts as &quot;high,&quot; and the quality of evidence derived from observational studies starts as &quot;low.&quot; The quality of evidence can then be lowered due to methodological limitations in individual studies (risk of bias), inconsistency across studies (heterogeneity), indirectness (the extent to which the evidence fails to apply to the specific clinical question in terms of the patients, interventions, or outcomes), imprecision (typically due to a small number of events or wide confidence intervals), and the presence of publication and reporting biases. Conversely, the quality of evidence can be upgraded in certain situations such as when the treatment effect is large or a dose-response relationship is evident.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel and methodology team identified existing systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines that were relevant to the topics of this guideline, even though they were not necessarily specific to people with SCD. If the methodological quality of these resources was found to be appropriate by the methodology team, they were used. Using this external evidence was considered helpful because well-conducted systematic reviews made the process of identifying relevant studies more feasible. In addition, using existing guidelines developed by professional organizations enabled the panel to develop more comprehensive recommendations that addressed specific aspects of care in individuals with SCD. Usually, this external evidence was derived from studies in non-sickle cell patient cohorts because it was felt that they offered more precise and useful inferences than evidence derived from sickle cell patient studies. For example, comparative evidence in the area of pain management in people with SCD was sparse. In this situation, pain management guidelines from individuals with other pain-related conditions proved to be helpful.</p>
<p>The methodology team used the AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Recent well-conducted systematic reviews were identified that addressed hydroxyurea therapy in pediatric and adult patients. The expert panel and methodology team appraised these reviews and conducted additional searches to update the existing systematic review through May 2010 to find evidence for the benefits, harms, and barriers of using hydroxyurea. Regarding the management of children with SCD complications, the panel also used recent evidence that had been systematically reviewed.</p>
<p>Existing clinical practice guidelines were considered acceptable if they had prespecified clinical questions, were developed after a comprehensive literature search, had explicit and clear criteria for the inclusion of evidence, and included recommendations that were explicitly linked to the quality of supporting evidence. The expert panel and methodology team used relevant recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) &quot;Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use,&quot; and the American Pain Society's &quot;Guideline for the Management of Acute and Chronic Pain in Sickle-Cell Disease,&quot; and &quot;Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Chronic Opioid Therapy in Chronic Noncancer Pain.&quot;</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>These guidelines were developed by an expert panel composed of health care professionals with expertise in family medicine, general internal medicine, adult and pediatric hematology, psychiatry, transfusion medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency department nursing, and evidence-based medicine. Panel members were selected by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Process and Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel first convened in the spring of 2009 to establish the vision and purpose of the panel, discuss the process and schedule for producing the guidelines, and determine the critical areas to be addressed. Prior to this meeting, the expert panel participated in a conference call to introduce the panel's work and discuss the overarching questions that should be answered by the guidelines. Before beginning the writing of the guidelines report, the expert panel divided its work into sections dealing with preventive care or health maintenance, recognition and management of acute sickle-cell disease (SCD)-related complications, recognition and management of chronic SCD-related complications, and the two most broadly assessed and available disease-modifying therapies for SCD, hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusions.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the methodology team and the supporting evidence center, the panel then developed key questions and literature search terms to identify evidence. The field of SCD has a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or large prospective cohort studies to guide clinical decisionmaking; therefore, few of the recommendations in this document are based on this highest quality evidence. For common health issues, the panel included the evidence-based recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as well as vetted recommendations of other groups. These recommendations include the SCD reproductive-related recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the immunization recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the acute and chronic pain management recommendations of the American Pain Society (APS). These recommendations are denoted as &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted.&quot;</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to provide practical guidance for common problems that may lie outside of the panel's evidence reviews or available science, in many areas the published evidence was supplemented by the expertise of the panel members, who have many years of experience in managing and studying individuals with SCD. Recommendations based on the opinions of the expert panel members are labeled as &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise.&quot; Each is clearly labeled with the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence available to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Determining the Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework rates the strength of recommendations as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak.&quot; However, the panel modified the GRADE system and used a third category&amp;mdash;moderate&amp;mdash;when they determined that patients would be better off if they followed a recommendation, despite there being some level of uncertainty about the magnitude of benefit of the intervention or the relative net benefit of alternative courses of action. The panel intends for these moderate-strength recommendations to be used to populate protocols of care and provide a guideline based on the best available evidence. The panel does not intend for weak- or moderate-strength recommendations to generate quality-of-care indicators or accountability measures or affect insurance reimbursement. Variation in care in the areas of weak- or moderate-strength recommendations may be acceptable, particularly in ways that reflect patient values and preferences. Conversely, strong recommendations represent areas in which there is confidence in the evidence supporting net benefit, and the recommendations likely apply to most individuals with sickle cell anemia.

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as &quot;consensus.&quot; Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with sickle cell disease [SCD] presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

    <li>Although red blood cell (RBC) transfusions can help ameliorate many of the acute and chronic complications of SCD&amp;mdash;and, at times, can be life-saving&amp;mdash;their administration is associated with a wide variety of complications. Some transfusion-associated events are relatively mild, while others can be severe or even fatal. Health care providers should become familiar with the range of transfusion complications and learn their signs and symptoms as well as appropriate diagnostic testing, prevention strategies, and therapeutic interventions when warranted. Refer to the section &quot;Complications of Transfusions&quot; in the original guideline document for a discussion of these complications, including alloimmunization and autoimmunization, iron overload, hemolysis, and hyperviscosity. </li>
