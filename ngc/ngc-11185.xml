	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacologic Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome [PICO] Question 1)</span></strong></p>
<p>In children hospitalized after trauma (P), should pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis be utilized (I), compared with no pharmacologic prophylaxis (C), to reduce the incidence of VTE (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation for Pharmacologic Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 1) </strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conditionally recommend that pharmacologic prophylaxis be considered for children older than 15 years who are at low risk of bleeding. They also conditionally recommend that pharmacologic prophylaxis be considered for children younger than 15 years old who are post-pubertal if they have an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 25. For prepubertal children, even with ISS greater than 25, the guideline authors conditionally recommend against routine pharmacologic prophylaxis. Further studies are necessary to provide recommendations in prepubertal children. These recommendations are conditional, given the paucity of published data in children and the very low quality of the available evidence. The recommendations are based on data in adults and the relative safety of enoxaparin at prophylactic doses in children (Gould et al., 2012; Bidlingmaier et al., 2011; Stem et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2013).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Mechanical VTE Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 2)</span></strong></p>
<p>In children hospitalized after trauma (P), should mechanical VTE prophylaxis be utilized (I), compared with no prophylaxis or in addition to pharmacologic prophylaxis (C), to reduce the incidence of VTE (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation for Mechanical Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 2)</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conditionally recommend that mechanical prophylaxis be considered alone or in addition to pharmacologic prophylaxis to hospitalized children older than 15 years and children younger than 15 years who are post-pubertal if they have an ISS greater than 25 for whom an appropriately sized device is available. This recommendation is conditional, given the paucity of published data in children and the very low quality of the available evidence. The recommendation is based on data in adults and the safety and tolerability of mechanical prophylaxis in children (Gould et al., 2012; Faustino et al., 2014).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Active Ultrasound Surveillance for VTE in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 3)</span></strong></p>
<p>In children hospitalized after trauma (P), should active surveillance for VTE with ultrasound be performed (I), compared with daily physical examination alone (C), to detect VTE earlier (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation for Active Ultrasound Surveillance for VTE in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 3) </strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conditionally recommend against active surveillance for VTE with ultrasound for earlier detection of VTE compared with routine daily physical examination alone in children hospitalized after trauma. The potential benefits of earlier detection and treatment of VTE are unclear, but the risk of bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation is well documented.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Inclusion Criteria for this Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors included case series, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials. Original studies from meta-analyses and reviews were also included. Case reports, surveys, and letters to the editor were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Type</strong></p>
<p>Any patient 0 to 21 years old who developed venous thromboembolism (VTE) after being hospitalized for trauma was included. Similar children who did not develop VTE were included as control subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention Types</strong></p>
<p>Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis consisted primarily of low-molecular-weight heparin, particularly enoxaparin, unfractionated heparin, or warfarin. Mechanical prophylaxis consisted of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings. Ultrasound scans of the lower extremities and of insertion sites for central venous catheters were used for active surveillance for VTE. The putative risk factors evaluated were age, severity of injury, presence of central venous catheters, major surgery, site and type of injury (i.e., acute spinal cord, pelvis fracture, femur fracture, head injury, abdominal injury, and chest injury), obesity, mechanical ventilation, use of recombinant factor VIIa, and immobilization.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Type</strong></p>
<p>The relevant outcomes were the incidence of VTE for Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Questions 1 and 2 and time to detection of VTE for PICO Question 3. Via consensus, the writing group considered incidence of VTE as a critical outcome and time to detection of VTE an important outcome. Venous thromboembolism was defined as deep vein thrombosis in the extremities and/or pulmonary embolism. For PICO Questions 1 and 2, only symptomatic VTE was included because this was the most consistently reported outcome in pediatric studies. For PICO Question 3, VTE detected by active surveillance with ultrasound, regardless of symptoms, was compared with symptomatic VTE. The authors also used symptomatic VTE as outcome for the review of putative risk factors. Given the paucity of data, other relevant outcomes (e.g., duration of hospitalization, incidence of stroke, mortality rate, duration of anticoagulation, recurrence of VTE, incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome, and costs of care) were not evaluated, even though the writing group considered these as important outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian performed a systematic review of the MEDLINE database using PubMed from January 1946 to July 2015. The search strategies included &quot;venous thromboembolism,&quot; &quot;trauma,&quot; and &quot;pediatric,&quot; with additional subject headings and text words per concept and with added specific terms for &quot;prophylaxis&quot; and &quot;prevention.&quot; The search was restricted to humans, availability of full text article, and publication in English language. Only clinical studies in a pediatric trauma population, defined as 21 years or younger, or studies that combined adults and children but had delineated analyses for children were analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the PICO questions of interest by one of the authors. Potentially relevant studies underwent full text review by the entire writing group to determine inclusion. Conflicts were resolved through group consensus.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Once the included articles were determined, data on the study type, subject characteristics, presence of putative risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), type of prophylaxis, presence of VTE, and strength of association between exposure, that is, prophylaxis or putative risk factor, and VTE were extracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Data were checked in duplicate for accuracy by two members of the writing group assigned to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) question. Inconsistencies were resolved through full group review of the data and discussion.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Methodological Quality/Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence for each PICO question was assessed by two members of the writing group. Based on the GRADE guidelines, randomized controlled trials and observational studies were initially categorized as having high and low quality, respectively. The category was upgraded or downgraded based on the five core GRADE domains of risk for bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, as well as the size of effect. The quality of evidence for each study was finalized after discussions with the entire writing group. The guideline authors utilized GRADEpro (McMaster University and Evidence Prime Incorporated, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), an online software, to create summary-of-findings tables for each PICO question.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Measures of Treatment Effect</span></strong></p>
<p>Because of the small number of studies available for each PICO question and significant differences in study design, meta-analysis was not performed, and summary measures of treatment effect were not calculated. Incidence of VTE was presented as counts (%), whereas that for time to detection of VTE was presented as median days. Comparisons for incidence of VTE were performed using Fisher exact test. For the putative risk factors, significant heterogeneity of studies or lack of control subjects prevented calculation of summary measures of effect. Strengths of association were expressed as odds or risk ratios.</p></div>"/>

While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider.
