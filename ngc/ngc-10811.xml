<p>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion should not be dictated by a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Where indicated, transfusion of a single unit of RBC, followed by clinical reassessment to determine the need for further transfusion, is appropriate. This reassessment will also guide the decision on whether to retest the Hb level (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Direct evidence is not available in general medical patients.<sup>a</sup> Evidence from other patient groups and Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) consensus suggests that, with a:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Hb concentration &amp;lt;70 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion may be associated with reduced mortality and is likely to be appropriate. However, transfusion may not be required in well-compensated patients or where other specific therapy is available. </li>
    <li><strong>Hb concentration of 70&amp;ndash;100 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion is not associated with reduced mortality. The decision to transfuse patients (with a single unit followed by reassessment) should be based on the need to relieve clinical signs and symptoms of anaemia, and the patient's response to previous transfusions. No evidence was found to warrant a different approach for patients who are elderly or who have respiratory or cerebrovascular disease. </li>
    <li><strong>Hb concentration &amp;gt;100 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion is likely to be unnecessary and is usually inappropriate. Transfusion has been associated with increased mortality in patients with ACS. (<strong>Practice Points</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy is required to replenish iron stores regardless of whether a transfusion is indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Recommendations and practice points for medical patients in a critical care setting will be found in the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summary of the National Blood Authority (NBA) guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49830&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10812&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Patient blood management guidelines: module 4 - critical care</a>. Recommendations and practice points for specific medical subgroups (acute coronary syndrome, chronic heart failure, cancer, acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and chronically transfused) appear below.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cardiac &amp;ndash; Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Red Cells</strong></p>
<p>In ACS patients with a Hb concentration &amp;gt;100 g/L, RBC transfusion is not advisable because of an association with increased mortality (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a Hb concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Where indicated, transfusion of a single unit of RBC, followed by clinical reassessment to determine the need for further transfusion, is appropriate. This reassessment will also guide the decision on whether to retest the Hb level (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy is required to replenish iron stores regardless of whether a transfusion is indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with ACS and a Hb concentration &amp;lt;80 g/L, RBC transfusion may be associated with reduced mortality and is likely to be appropriate (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with ACS and a Hb concentration of 80&amp;ndash;100 g/L, the effect of RBC transfusion on mortality is uncertain and may be associated with an increased risk of recurrence of myocardial infarction (MI). Any decision to transfuse should be made with caution and based on careful consideration of the risks and benefits (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cardiac &amp;ndash; Heart Failure</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Iron and Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs)</strong></p>
<p>In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), identification and treatment of iron deficiency (absolute and functional) is recommended to improve functional or performance status (<strong>Grade B</strong>). This is consistent with the 2011 update to the <em>Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection and Management of Chronic Heart Failure</em> <em>in Australia</em>, 2006. Note: The studies reviewed only included patients treated with intravenous (IV) iron, and of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II or III.</p>
<p><strong>Red Cells</strong></p>
<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a Hb concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Where indicated, transfusion of a single unit of RBC, followed by clinical reassessment to determine the need for further transfusion, is appropriate. This reassessment will also guide the decision on whether to retest the Hb level (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Direct evidence is not available in general medical patients.<sup>a</sup> Evidence from other patient groups and CRG consensus suggests that, with a:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Hb concentration &amp;lt;70 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion may be associated with reduced mortality and is likely to be appropriate. However, transfusion may not be required in well-compensated patients or where other specific therapy is available. </li>

    <li><strong>Hb concentration &amp;gt;100 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion is likely to be unnecessary and is usually inappropriate. Transfusion has been associated with increased mortality in patients with ACS. (<strong>Practice Points</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy is required to replenish iron stores regardless of whether a transfusion is indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In all patients with heart failure, there is an increased risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload. This needs to be considered in all transfusion decisions. Where indicated, transfusion should be of a single unit of RBC followed by reassessment of clinical efficacy and fluid status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>). For further guidance on how to manage patients with heart failure, refer to general medical or ACS sections, as appropriate.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Recommendations and practice points for medical patients in a critical care setting will be found in the NGC summary of the NBA guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49830&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10812&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Patient blood management guidelines: module 4 - critical care</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Red Cells</strong></p>
<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a Hb concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>

</ul>
<p>In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy is required to replenish iron stores regardless of whether a transfusion is indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with cancer, the aetiology of anaemia is often multifactorial; where appropriate, reversible causes should be identified and treated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>There is a lack of specific evidence relating to the effects of RBC transfusion in patients with cancer. Any decision to transfuse should be based on the need to relieve clinical signs and symptoms of anaemia (<strong>Practice Point</strong>). When treating patients with cancer, refer also to the general medical population.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Recommendations and practice points for medical patients in a critical care setting will be found in the NGC summary of the NBA guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49830&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10812&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Patient blood management guidelines: module 4 - critical care</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Iron and ESAs</strong></p>
<p>In cancer patients with anaemia, the <em>routine</em> use of ESAs is not recommended because of the increased risks of mortality and thromboembolic events (<strong>Grade A</strong>).</p>
<p>In anaemic patients with cancer receiving ESAs, evaluate iron status to guide adjuvant iron therapy (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Gastrointestinal</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Red Cells</strong></p>
<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a Hb concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>

    <li><strong>Hb concentration &amp;gt;100 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion is likely to be unnecessary and is usually inappropriate. Transfusion has been associated with increased mortality in patients with ACS. </li>
</ul>
<p>In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy is required to replenish iron stores regardless of whether a transfusion is indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In well-compensated patients with acute upper gastrointestinal blood loss that is non-critical, there is no evidence to favour a liberal transfusion policy. Therefore, a more restrictive approach may be appropriate. There are no data to support a specific Hb treatment target in these patients (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>For critically bleeding patients, refer to the NBA guideline <a href=&quot;https://www.blood.gov.au/system/files/documents/pbm-module-1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;NBA Web site&quot;>Patient blood management guidelines: module 1 - critical bleeding/massive transfusion</a> (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Recommendations and practice points for medical patients in a critical care setting will be found in the NGC summary of the NBA guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49830&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10812&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Patient blood management guidelines: module 4 - critical care</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Iron and ESAs</strong></p>
<p>In patients with in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), determine the cause of anaemia and treat reversible causes. IV iron may be required in patients who are intolerant of oral iron, or to avoid aggravation of intestinal inflammation (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Iron and ESAs</strong></p>
<p>In anaemic patients with CKD, ESA therapy to a low to intermediate Hb target may be used to avoid RBC transfusion, after consideration of risks and benefits for the individual patient (<strong>Grade B</strong>). Note: The Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment (CARI) guidelines recommend a Hb target between 100 and 115 g/L.</p>
<p>In anaemic patients with CKD, ESA therapy to a low to intermediate Hb target may be used to relieve fatigue, after consideration of risks and benefits for the individual patient (<strong>Grade C</strong>). Note: The CARI guidelines recommend a Hb target between 100 and 115 g/L.</p>
<p>In anaemic patients with CKD, ESA therapy to a Hb target of over 130 g/L is not recommended because of increased morbidity (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p>In anaemic patients with non dialysis-dependent CKD, type 2 diabetes and a history of malignancy, the <em>routine</em> use of ESAs is not recommended because of the increased risk of cancer-related mortality (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p>ESA use is less effective in patients with chronic renal failure who have absolute or functional iron deficiency (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>For comprehensive information about ESA and iron therapy in patients with CKD, refer to CARI iron guidelines (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>

<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a Hb concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Where indicated, transfusion of a single unit of RBC, followed by clinical reassessment to determine the need for further transfusion, is appropriate. This reassessment will also guide the decision on whether to retest the Hb level (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Direct evidence is not available in general medical patients.<sup>a</sup> Evidence from other patient groups and CRG consensus suggests that, with a:</p>

    <li><strong>Hb concentration &amp;lt;70 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion may be associated with reduced mortality and is likely to be appropriate. However, transfusion may not be required in well-compensated patients or where other specific therapy is available. </li>
    <li><strong>Hb concentration of 70&amp;ndash;100 g/L</strong>, RBC transfusion is not associated with reduced mortality. The decision to transfuse patients (with a single unit followed by reassessment) should be based on the need to relieve clinical signs and symptoms of anaemia, and the patient's response to previous transfusions.

<p>In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy is required to replenish iron stores regardless of whether a transfusion is indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Platelets</strong></p>
<p>In patients undergoing chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the recommended strategy for prophylactic use of platelets is transfusion at a platelet count of &amp;lt;10 &amp;times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L in the absence of risk factors, and at &amp;lt;20 &amp;times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L in the presence of risk factors (e.g., fever, minor bleeding) (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p>Platelet transfusion may be indicated for the prevention and treatment of haemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet function defects. Platelet transfusions are not indicated in all causes of thrombocytopenia, and may be contraindicated in certain conditions (e.g., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP] and heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia [HIT]). Thus, the cause of the thrombocytopenia should be established and expert opinion sought (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients undergoing chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, there is no evidence to support:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A lower trigger for prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients with risk factors (e.g., fever, minor bleeding) </li>
    <li>A strategy of therapeutic-only platelet transfusions (i.e., for treatment of clinically significant bleeding) </li>
</ul>
<p>Further research to determine the safety and efficacy of a lower platelet transfusion trigger is underway (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Thalassaemia and Myelodysplasia</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Red Cells</strong></p>
<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a Hb concentration alone, but should also be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Where indicated, transfusion of a single unit of RBC, followed by clinical reassessment to determine the need for further transfusion, is appropriate. This reassessment will also guide the decision on whether to retest the Hb level (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with thalassaemia, the evidence does not support any change to the current practice of maintaining a pretransfusion Hb concentration of 90&amp;ndash;100 g/L, with transfusions at about monthly intervals (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with myelodysplasia who are regularly and chronically transfused, there is no evidence to guide particular Hb thresholds. Decisions around appropriate triggers and frequency of transfusion need to be individualised, taking into account anaemia-related symptoms, functional or performance status, and the patient&amp;rsquo;s response to previous transfusions (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Platelets</strong></p>
<p>In patients with chronic failure of platelet production (e.g., myelodysplasia or aplastic anaemia), a specific threshold for transfusion may not be appropriate. These patients are best managed on an individual basis, in consultation with a relevant expert.</p>
<p>Long-term prophylactic platelet transfusions may be best avoided because of the risk of complications (e.g., alloimmunisation and platelet refractoriness).</p>
<p>Therapeutic platelet transfusions could be considered for treatment of bleeding (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Coagulopathy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)</strong></p>
<p>The <em>routine</em> use of FFP in medical patients with coagulopathy (including those with liver impairment) is not supported. Tests for coagulation correlate poorly with bleeding risk in liver impairment.</p>
<p>The underlying causes of coagulopathy should be assessed. Where FFP transfusion is considered necessary, the risks and benefits should be considered for each patient, and expert guidance sought (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>For guidance on the use of FFP in specific patient groups, refer to:</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Definitions of these study designs are provided on pages 7-8, <em>How to use the evidence: assessment and application of scientific evidence</em> (NHMRC, 2000).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>If it is possible and ethical to determine a causal relationship using experimental evidence, then the 'intervention' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised. If it is only possible or ethical to determine a causal relationship using observational evidence (e.g., groups cannot be allocated to a potential harmful exposure, such as nuclear radiation), then the 'aetiology' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup>A systematic review will only be assigned a level of evidence as high as the studies it contains, except where those studies contain Level II evidence. Systematic reviews of Level II evidence provide more data than the individual studies, and any meta-analyses will increase the precision of the overall results, reducing the likelihood that the results are affected by chance. Systematic reviews of lower level evidence present results of likely poor internal validity and thus are rated on the likelihood that the results have been affected by bias, rather than whether the systematic review itself is of good quality. Systematic review quality should be assessed separately. A systematic review should consist of at least two studies. In systematic reviews that include different study designs, the overall level of evidence should relate to each individual outcome or result, as different studies (and study designs) might contribute to each different outcome.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>d</sup>At study inception, the cohort is either non-diseased or all at the same stage of the disease. A randomised controlled trial with persons either non-diseased or at the same stage of the disease in both arms of the trial would also meet the criterion for this level of evidence.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>e</sup>All or none of the people with the risk factor(s) experience the outcome; and the data arises from an unselected or representative case series which provides an unbiased representation of the prognostic effect. For example, no smallpox develops in the absence of the specific virus; and clear proof of the causal link has come from the disappearance of smallpox after large-scale vaccination.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>f</sup>This also includes controlled before-and-after (pre-test/post-test) studies, as well as indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>g</sup>Comparing single arm studies, i.e., case series from two studies. This would also include unadjusted indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C, without statistical adjustment for B).</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Definitions of these study designs are provided on pages 7-8, <em>How to use the evidence: assessment and application of scientific evidence</em> (NHMRC, 2000).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>If it is possible and ethical to determine a causal relationship using experimental evidence, then the 'intervention' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised. If it is only possible or ethical to determine a causal relationship using observational evidence (e.g., groups cannot be allocated to a potential harmful exposure, such as nuclear radiation), then the 'aetiology' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup>A systematic review will only be assigned a level of evidence as high as the studies it contains, except where those studies contain Level II evidence. Systematic reviews of Level II evidence provide more data than the individual studies, and any meta-analyses will increase the precision of the overall results, reducing the likelihood that the results are affected by chance. Systematic reviews of lower level evidence present results of likely poor internal validity and thus are rated on the likelihood that the results have been affected by bias, rather than whether the systematic review itself is of good quality. Systematic review quality should be assessed separately. A systematic review should consist of at least two studies. In systematic reviews that include different study designs, the overall level of evidence should relate to each individual outcome or result, as different studies (and study designs) might contribute to each different outcome.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>d</sup>At study inception, the cohort is either non-diseased or all at the same stage of the disease. A randomised controlled trial with persons either non-diseased or at the same stage of the disease in both arms of the trial would also meet the criterion for this level of evidence.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>e</sup>All or none of the people with the risk factor(s) experience the outcome; and the data arises from an unselected or representative case series which provides an unbiased representation of the prognostic effect. For example, no smallpox develops in the absence of the specific virus; and clear proof of the causal link has come from the disappearance of smallpox after large-scale vaccination.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>f</sup>This also includes controlled before-and-after (pre-test/post-test) studies, as well as indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>g</sup>Comparing single arm studies, i.e., case series from two studies. This would also include unadjusted indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C, without statistical adjustment for B).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Systematic reviews were undertaken to attempt to answer the question specific to medical transfusion, and the generic questions relevant to all six modules of the Patient Blood Management Guidelines. The systematic review questions are listed in Box 2.1 in the original guideline document. Refer to the Technical Reports (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for details concerning the systematic review process and all evidence summary tables.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification and Assessment of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Studies identified for inclusion from the literature search were classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) levels of evidence hierarchy (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). To ensure that modules were based on the best available evidence, studies of higher levels of evidence (Levels I or II) were included in preference to those presenting lower levels of evidence (Levels III or IV). This was to minimise the potential for bias in the evidence base for each systematically reviewed question. However, lower level studies were reviewed where evidence was not available in higher level studies for any of the primary outcomes.</p>
<p>Studies identified from the systematic literature review were assessed according to NHMRC dimensions of evidence (see Table 2.2 in Technical Report Volume 1). There are three main domains: strength of the evidence, size of the effect, and relevance of the evidence. The first domain was derived directly from the literature identified for a particular intervention, aetiology or prognostic study. The other two domains were determined in consultation with the Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) as part of the study assessment process during the review of the evidence considered for module development. An aspect of the strength of the evidence domain is the level of evidence of the study, which was determined as described above using the NHMRC levels of evidence hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the criteria presented in Appendix 3 of Technical Report Volume 1. Quality assessment criteria varied according to whether included studies were systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cohort studies or case&amp;ndash;control studies. No weighting of quality criteria was applied, but studies that met all criteria, or all but one, were considered good quality with a low risk of bias. Quality assessments of included studies for all systematically reviewed research questions are presented in Appendix E in Technical Report Volume 2.</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Data and information were extracted into evidence summary tables according to the inclusion criteria (population, intervention, comparator, outcome [PICO], population, risk, outcome [PRO] or population, predictor, outcome [PPO]). Evidence summary tables were based on NHMRC requirements for externally developed guidelines. Extracted data and information included general study details (citation, study design, evidence level, country and setting), characteristics of study participants, details of interventions and comparators, details of internal (e.g., allocation and blinding) and external (applicability and generalisability) study validity; and results for outcomes specified in the inclusion criteria. Where relevant studies were identified, extracted data and information were used to construct study characteristics and results tables of included evidence for each systematically reviewed research question. Evidence summary tables for all included studies are presented in Appendix F of Technical Report Volume 2.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of the Body of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The body of evidence for each module recommendation was graded in accordance with the NHMRC framework for developing evidence-based recommendations. Assessment of the body of evidence considers the dimensions of evidence of studies relevant to that recommendation. The NHMRC developed an evidence statement form to be used with each clinical research question considered in guidelines development (see Appendix 3 of Technical Report Volume 1). Before the evidence statement form was completed, included studies were critically appraised and relevant data were summarised, as described. This information was required to formulate each recommendation and determine the overall grade of the body of evidence supporting each recommendation.</p>
<p>The key findings from included studies were summarised as evidence statements for each systematically reviewed research question. Where required, separate evidence statements were developed for different patient populations and outcomes. CRG input helped ensure that the size of effects and relevance of evidence were considered when developing evidence statements. Where no evidence or insufficient relevant evidence was identified, this was explained in the evidence statement and an evidence statement form was not included.</p>
<p>Refer to Technical Report Volume 1 for Steps 1 and 2 in using the NHMRC evidence statement form. Completed evidence statement forms for each research question are presented in Appendix D of Technical Report Volume 2.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) developed recommendations where sufficient evidence was available from the systematic review of the literature. The recommendations have been carefully worded to reflect the strength of the body of evidence.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Governance Structure</span></strong></p>
<p>A multilevel management framework was established by the National Blood Authority (NBA) to coordinate the development of the new patient blood management guidelines. The management framework (illustrated in Appendix A of the original guideline document) consists of:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A Steering Committee, responsible for the overall development and governance of the entire project </li>
    <li>An Expert Working Group (EWG), responsible for clinical oversight and integration of the six modules </li>
    <li>CRGs (one for each of the six modules), with membership including representation from relevant colleges, societies and consumer groups, to provide expert knowledge and input </li>
    <li>Systematic reviewers and a technical writer, contracted by the NBA to review the literature and develop a draft of each module </li>
    <li>An independent systematic review expert, to provide advice and mentoring to the systematic reviewers, technical writer, EWG and CRGs; and to ensure that the development process and the revised guidelines comply with NHMRC requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>The NBA provided the secretariat, project funding and project management. The NBA website includes a list of colleges and societies that have endorsed these guidelines. Appendix A in the original guideline document lists the membership of the bodies involved in governance of the guidelines. Details of how the guidelines will be implemented and updated are provided in Chapter 6 of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Formulation of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of the NHMRC Evidence Statement Form</strong></p>
<p><em>Step 3: Formulation of a Recommendation Based on the Body of Evidence</em></p>
<p>Step 3 involved formulating the wording of the recommendation. This wording was intended to reflect the strength of the body evidence; that is, where the evidence base was regarded as poor or unreliable, words such as 'must' or 'should' were not used. The wording of recommendations was developed in conjunction with the CRG during meetings to review the evidence base for research questions.</p>
<p><em>Step 4: Determination of the Grade for the Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The overall grade for each recommendation was determined from a summary of the rating for each component of the body of evidence (outlined in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Definitions of the NHMRC grades of recommendations are presented in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field. In accordance with the NHMRC framework, recommendations were not graded A or B unless the evidence base and consistency of evidence were both rated A or B unless only one study was included and consistency was rated 'N/A'. In this situation the quality, size and strength of the evidence base was relied upon to grade the recommendation. The grading of recommendations was determined in conjunction with the CRG.</p>
<p>Developed recommendations were entered into the NHMRC evidence statement forms to accompany the corresponding evidence statement matrix, along with the overall grade determined in this step (see Appendix D of Technical Report Volume 2a [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p><strong>Practice Points</strong></p>
<p>Practice points were developed by the CRG through a facilitated group discussion (see Appendix 4 in Technical Report Volume 1a [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field)] in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Where the underpinning evidence would have led to a grade D evidence-based recommendation </li>
    <li>Where the CRG developed evidence-based recommendations graded C and above, but considered that additional information was required to guide clinical practice. Wherever possible, this guidance was sourced from other evidence-based guidelines assessed to be of high quality. </li>
    <li>Where insufficient evidence was identified to support the development of an evidence-based recommendation </li>
</ul></div>"/>

<p>Traditionally, it has been assumed that blood transfusion benefits patients; however, a benefit has not been demonstrable in many clinical scenarios. In addition, evidence is accumulating that serious nonviral adverse events, such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), are more common than previously thought, and that more recently identified conditions (e.g., transfusion-related immunomodulation) may cause patients harm.</p>
<p>The risk of transmission of infectious diseases through blood transfusions has reduced significantly in recent years through improved manufacturing and laboratory processes. However, there is potential for transfusion of an unrecognised infectious agent.</p>
<p>Despite improvements in systems management, there remains a risk of transfusion-related harm due to administrative error. Such an error has the potential to result in acute haemolytic reaction from ABO incompatibility, which may be fatal.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implementing, Evaluating and Maintaining the Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Blood Authority (NBA), in collaboration with the Steering Committee and Expert Working Group (EWG) members, developed a plan to guide appropriate communication on the implementation of this module. The plan identifies target audiences for the module, strategies and tools for effective implementation, communication channels and key messages.</p>
<p>Continued re-evaluation of the guidelines is necessary to reduce variation in practice patterns, support appropriate use of blood component therapy and reduce inappropriate exposure of patients to blood components. A plan was designed to evaluate implementation of the six modules of the guidelines and to determine:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The extent to which the guidelines influence changes in clinical practice and health outcomes </li>
    <li>What factors (if any) contribute to noncompliance with the guidelines </li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the evaluation will be used to inform future review of the guidelines. Economic issues were considered when formulating the evidence-based recommendations. The recommendations are likely to reduce product associated expenditure. All recommendations within this Module either constrain the use of more expensive products (such as blood and blood products and erythropoietin stimulating agents) or replace them with less expensive products (such as iron therapy). Patient blood management however, requires effective coordination of care. The cost of introducing a coordinated patient blood management approach is anticipated to be offset by savings in reduced product consumption. The NBA, together with the Jurisdictional Blood Committee (JBC) and key stakeholders, is developing a program to facilitate uptake of the Patient Blood Management (PBM) guidelines.</p>
<p>The program will include the development of a comprehensive toolkit to support the introduction of patient blood management practices in the clinical setting. The toolkit is being developed with the help of a network of patient blood management practitioners, who will facilitate uptake of the guidelines. The NBA has also funded the development of an online iron deficiency anaemia course within the BloodSafe eLearning Program. Funding has been provided for this course to be marketed to healthcare practitioners in the primary and secondary care setting. In addition, the NBA is working with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare (ACSQHC) to develop a hospital guide to support the implementation of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards. The guide will provide links to the patient blood management guidelines and toolkit, and the BloodSafe eLearning course. These resources provide explicit tools to support uptake of the recommendations in this module.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implementation of Guidelines Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) framework directs that guidelines implementation should be considered at the same time that recommendations are formulated. The NHMRC evidence statement form contains questions related to the implementation of each module (see Appendix 3 in Technical Report Volume 1 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). These are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Will this recommendation result in changes in usual care? </li>
    <li>Are there any resource implications associated with implementing this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Will the implementation of this recommendation require changes in the way care is currently organised? </li>
    <li>Is the guidelines development group aware of any barriers to the implementation of this recommendation? </li>
</ul>
<p>This section of the NHMRC evidence statement form was completed in consultation with the Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) when each recommendation was formulated and graded. Implementation issues are recorded in the NHMRC evidence statement forms presented in Appendix D of Technical Report Volume 2 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

Mr Shannon Farmer declared the following patient advocacy roles: the Society for the Advancement of Blood Management, the Medical Society for Blood Management and the Network for Advancement of Transfusion Alternatives. Professor Lawrence McMahon declared that he was a prescriber of erythropoiesis stimulating agents. He declared travel grants to attend the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Annual Scientific Meeting in 2010 from Roche and in 2012 from Amgen. He received a research grant from Amgen in 2009 and an unrestricted educational grant for research from Roche in 2011. He was on the Roche Advisory Board for Mircera (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator) in 2008.
