	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>A medical librarian conducted systematic searches of the databases MEDLINE&amp;reg;, CINAHL&amp;reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in April 2013 and November 2014, and limited results to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized and nonrandomized trials and studies, reviews, and guidelines. The librarian also conducted a non-systematic search of the Scopus&amp;reg; database. The searches were limited to literature published in English between 2006 and November 2014. At the time of the initial searches, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until April 2015, presented relevant alert results to the lead author.</p>
<p>During the development of this guideline, the lead author requested supplementary literature searches and additional literature that either did not fit the original search criteria or was discovered during the evidence-appraisal process. Finally, the lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies, professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Although the lead author's original search request encompassed both moderate sedation and local anesthesia, only literature relevant to the care of patients receiving moderate sedation/analgesia was considered for inclusion in this document. Search terms included <em>conscious sedation, anti-anxiety agents, flumazenil, naloxone, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, drug hypersensitivity, risk assessment, sleep apnea syndromes, continuous positive airway pressure, modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance test, bispectral index, airway management,</em> and <em>patient discharge</em>. Other key words were included to address the concepts of patient assessment, sedation scales, risk factors, patient monitoring, and tools and methods for predicting difficult mask ventilation. The complete search strategies are available upon request.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, relevance to the key questions, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none was available.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and literature that examined local anesthesia, local monitored anesthesia care, general anesthesia, regional anesthesia (e.g., spinal, epidural), total intravenous anesthesia, minimal sedation, deep sedation, endotracheal intubation, laryngoscopy, awake intubation, dental office procedures, fospropofol, etomidate, propofol administration in the emergency room and intensive care unit, sedation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, palliative care, premedication for general anesthesia, pain management following discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and proceduralist techniques. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available.</p></div>"/>
