	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>The literature search was performed between 2012 and 2014 and aimed to identify relevant studies published during the previous 10-year period (January of 2003 to June of 2014). Electronic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases were performed. The journal <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Global Open</em> was searched separately, as publications from <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Global Open</em> were not indexed in the selected databases at the time of this review. Literature searches were performed by using appropriate combinations of the following MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords, as permitted by the search functionalities of each database/journal:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>MeSH terms (used in PubMed only): &quot;Abdomen&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Abdominal Wall&quot; [MeSH], &quot;Free Tissue Flaps&quot; [MeSH], &quot;Hematoma&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Hernia&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Infection&quot; [Mesh], &quot;Mammaplasty&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Necrosis&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Patient Outcome Assessment&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Patient Satisfaction&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Postoperative Complications&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Pulmonary embolism&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Reoperation&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Risk&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Second-look Surgery&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Seroma&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Surgical Flaps&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Surgical Mesh&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Surgical Wound Dehiscence&quot;[MeSH], &quot;Treatment Outcome&quot;[MeSH], and &quot;Venous Thrombosis&quot;[MeSH]. </li>
    <li>Keywords: Abdominal flap, abdominal free flap, abdominal pedicled flap, abdominal weakness, autologous breast reconstruction, bulge, complications, deep vein thrombosis, flap failure, outcomes, and patient satisfaction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Initial study selection for each clinical question was performed by one reviewer with a two-level screening process. Level I screening involved a review of the title and abstracts of the articles captured by the search strategies, to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in level II screening. Level II screening involved a review of the full-text of articles to confirm relevance and compare study details with the inclusion and exclusion criteria below.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Published within the past 10 years (January 1, 2003, to June 14, 2014) </li>
    <li>Published in English language </li>
    <li>Reported a meta-analysis/systematic review; randomized controlled trial; prospective or retrospective cohort/comparative, case-control, or case series </li>
    <li>Reported outcomes of interest for clinical questions (complications and/or patient satisfaction) </li>
    <li>Included at least 30 patients </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Published outside of inclusion date range </li>

    <li>Reported no outcomes of interest </li>
    <li>Included fewer than 30 patients </li>
</ul>
<p>The bibliographies of articles meeting inclusion criteria were manually searched to identify relevant articles missed during the electronic searches. These articles were screened as described above. Duplicate articles were eliminated. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were assessed for methodologic quality, as described below. Excluded studies and their reasons for exclusion were documented for review by the Work Group to confirm the final rejection or reconsider the study for inclusion. Additional references were included in this review if considered necessary for background or discussion; however, these references were not critically appraised or used in the development of recommendation statements.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Critical Appraisal of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Plastic Surgeons evidence-based process includes a rigorous critical appraisal process to evaluate the methodologic quality of clinical studies and the strength of clinical evidence for the purposes of developing clinical practice guidelines and performance measures. The process is also used to rate individual studies published in <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em>. Studies were appraised for methodologic quality with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Critical Appraisal Checklists and assigned levels of evidence according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Evidence Rating Scales, which are designed for the evaluation of therapeutic, prognostic/risk, and diagnostic studies (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The checklists and scales were developed in 2009 by an expert Task Force and are based on the principles of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. Each study was appraised by at least two reviewers. If a discrepancy existed between the reviewers, the study was appraised by a third reviewer, and the level of evidence was determined by consensus. Evidence ratings were not assigned to studies with inadequately described methods and/or worrisome biases. As such, these studies were excluded from further review.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Outcomes Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>Quantitative and qualitative data relevant to the clinical questions were extracted from the studies that met inclusion criteria and qualified for a level-of-evidence rating. Data were compiled in Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.) spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Quantitative data on complication outcomes were pooled across the studies to calculate the probability of the complication occurring for each flap type. The following complications were evaluated, if reported in the studies:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Donor-site complications: hernia, bulge, infection, necrosis, seroma, hematoma, and wound dehiscence </li>
    <li>Flap-related complications: flap loss, necrosis, infection, seroma, hematoma, and wound dehiscence </li>
    <li>Systemic complications: venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism </li>
    <li>Procedure-related complications: revision/reoperation and reconstruction failure rate </li>
</ul>
<p>Patient satisfaction was evaluated differently among the included studies. Because of the number and variety of scales used for assessing patient satisfaction, the reported scales were grouped into three categories: Michigan Breast Satisfaction Questionnaires, 10-point Likert scales, and other (e.g., Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, Qualitative Assessment of Back Pain). The 10-point Likert scales were assessed similarly to the Michigan Breast Satisfaction Questionnaire by separating the level of satisfaction into binary groups (1 through 7 = not satisfied; 8 through 10 = satisfied).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Work Group Selection Process</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Plastic Surgeons members were invited to apply to the Work Group by means of Society e-mail and fax communication. All applicants were required to submit an online conflict-of-interest disclosure form for membership consideration. Members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Quality and Performance Measurement Committee reviewed and selected Work Group members to ensure a diverse representation of U.S. regions; practice type (large multispecialty group practice, small group practice, solo practice, and academic practice); and clinical, research, and evidence-based medicine experiences and expertise. Four stakeholder organizations&amp;mdash;the American Society of Breast Surgeons, the American College of Radiology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the American Society for Radiation Oncology&amp;mdash;were also invited to participate in the guideline development process by nominating one member from their respective organizations to serve on the Work Group. A patient representative was included on the panel to provide insight related to patient values and preferences, and an American Society of Plastic Surgeons quality department staff member was assigned to manage the project and provide expertise in clinical practice guideline development methodology.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question Development</span></strong></p>
<p>Work Group members used a consensus-based approach to select the clinical questions to be addressed in this evidence-based guideline. Work Group members used a blinded process to submit clinical questions by means of individual e-mail to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons project manager, who compiled and dispersed the clinical questions for consideration and discussion at the introductory meeting. The clinical questions were selected with a five-phase process that consisted of brainstorming, discussion, ranking/prioritizing, refining, and voting.</p>
<p>A total of 36 clinical questions were reviewed by the Work Group and ranked according to the following criteria to assess for potential impact: (1) relevance to guideline scope; (2) addresses a gap in care; (3) ability to develop into an actionable recommendation; (4) ability to develop into an implementable recommendation; (5) is controversial or of significant interest; and (6) is important to public health. The Work Group initially agreed on 11 clinical questions; however, the large scope of the overall topic of autologous breast reconstruction would not allow for a timely guideline. In 2016, the guideline was narrowed and the original 11 clinical questions were refined into the following two clinical questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In patients undergoing mastectomy and autologous breast reconstruction, which surgical technique, pedicled transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap versus deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, is associated with the lower incidence of clinical complications? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing mastectomy and autologous breast reconstruction, which surgical technique, pedicled TRAM flap versus DIEP flap, is associated with the highest level of patient satisfaction? </li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the methodology and results described herein relate to the review of data and the development of recommendations for these clinical questions only. The remaining clinical questions may be considered for future guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical practice recommendations were developed through a consensus process with consideration to the following three factors: (1) level of evidence (study quality); (2) assessment of benefits versus harms; and (3) patient preferences. Work Group members jointly drafted statements for each recommendation during conference call meetings and online discussions. After each meeting, members had an opportunity to individually comment and revise the draft recommendations by means of e-mail discussion. Work Group members participated in several rounds of revisions until unanimous consensus was achieved for each recommendation statement. Each recommendation in this guideline is accompanied by a grade indicating the strength of the recommendation, which was determined by considering the overall level of evidence supporting the recommendation and the judgment of the guideline developers.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Evidence-based guidelines are strategies for patient management, developed to assist physicians in clinical decision-making. This guideline was developed through a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and consideration of relevant clinical experience, and describes a range of generally acceptable approaches to diagnosis, management, or prevention of specific diseases or conditions. This guideline attempts to define principles of practice that should generally meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. </li>
    <li>This guideline should not be construed as a rule, nor should it be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the appropriate results. It is anticipated that it will be necessary to approach some patients' needs in different ways. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the physician in light of all the circumstances presented by the patient, the available diagnostic and treatment options, and available resources. </li>
    <li>This guideline is not intended to define or serve as the standard of medical care. Standards of medical care are determined on the basis of all the facts or circumstances involved in an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and as practice patterns evolve. This guideline reflects the state of current knowledge at the time of publication. Given the inevitable changes in the state of scientific information and technology, this guideline will be considered relevant for a period of 5 years after publication; publication, in accordance with the inclusion criteria of the National Guideline Clearinghouse. </li>
