      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the ratings of overall strength of evidence and recommendation categories can be found at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conclusion and Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>On the basis of a high overall strength of evidence of effectiveness, barcoding systems for specimen labeling and point-of-care test barcoding are recommended as best practices to reduce identification errors and improve the accuracy of patient specimen and laboratory testing identification in hospital settings. The high overall strength of evidence is due to sufficient evidence of practice effectiveness from individual studies demonstrating consistent and substantial reduction in patient specimen and laboratory testing-related identification error rates in hospital settings. The findings of barcoding effectiveness are based on 10 studies of specimen barcoding systems and 7 studies of point-of-care test barcoding assessing impact on identification errors. In every study barcoding is associated with a reduction in the identification error rate. The meta-analysis overall summary effect mean odds ratio favoring barcoding is 4.39 (95% confidence interval: 3.05&amp;ndash;6.32) for barcoding systems and 5.93 (95% confidence interval: 5.28&amp;ndash;6.67) for point-of-care test barcoding. There was limited evidence of additional benefits and potential harms associated with the use of barcoding for specimen and laboratory testing identification, and any effect of potential harms appears to be very small relative to its overall benefits. All included studies were conducted in hospital settings. No evidence was available for assessing the effectiveness and applicability of barcoding in other laboratory testing settings.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Overall Strength of Evidence Ratings</span></strong></p>
<p>The revised definitions for these categories, modeled after the US Preventive Services Task Force (2008) are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: An adequate volume of evidence is available and includes consistent evidence of substantial healthcare quality changes from studies without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Some evidence is available and includes consistent evidence of substantial healthcare quality changes from without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: Limited evidence is available and includes consistent evidence of moderate healthcare quality changes from a small number of studies without major limitations; OR the quality of some of the studies' design and/or conduct is limited.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient</strong>: Any estimate of an effect is very uncertain. Available evidence of effectiveness is:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Inconsistent or weak; OR </li>
    <li>Consistent but with a minimal effect; OR </li>
    <li>Contained in an inadequate volume to determine effectiveness </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Categories</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendation rating categories are consistent with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) group findings (2008) and reflect the extent to which the available evidence gives one confidence that a practice will do more good than harm.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend</strong>: The practice should be identified as a best practice for implementation in appropriate care settings, taking into account variations in implementation and/or care settings. This recommendation results from consistent and high or moderate overall evidence of effectiveness strength rating of desirable impacts.</p>
<p><strong>No recommendation for or against</strong>: The potentially favorable impact on care outcomes and/or error reduction is not sufficient, or not sufficiently supported by evidence to indicate that it should be identified as a best practice for implementation in appropriate care settings. Additional studies may be warranted to strengthen the relevant evidence base. This recommendation results from insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend against</strong>: The practice should not be identified as a best practice for implementation because of consistent evidence of adverse effects.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Initiative (LMBP) methods begin with the ASK step which frames at least one review question supported by an analytic framework and PICO elements (population, intervention/practice, comparator, outcome). The question answered by this evidence review is:</p>
<p><em>Are barcoding practices effective at reducing patient specimen and laboratory testing identification errors?</em> This review question is addressed in the context of an analytic framework for the quality issue of patient specimen and laboratory testing identification errors (see Fig. 1 in original guideline document). The relevant PICO elements are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Population: all patients in healthcare settings using laboratory or point-of-care testing and their specimens requiring accurate identification for use in a healthcare context </li>
    <li>Intervention: barcoding practices defined as laboratory test barcoding systems using barcoded patient identification linked to specimen labels or point-of-care testing </li>
    <li>Comparison practice/intervention: non-barcoded identification systems for patients, specimens and laboratory tests </li>
    <li>Outcome: specimen and/or laboratory testing identification error rates are the primary and most direct outcome of interest. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>ACQUIRE: Search for Practice Effectiveness Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The search for studies of barcoding practice effectiveness to reduce patient specimen and laboratory testing ID errors included a systematic search of multiple electronic databases, hand searching of bibliographies from relevant information sources and their bibliographies, provision of references by as well as consultation with experts in the field including members of the expert panel (see Appendix A in the original guideline document). Additional evidence was obtained by solicitation of unpublished quality improvement studies resulting in submissions to the LMBP. The literature search strategy and terms were developed with the assistance of a research librarian and included a systematic search in August 2011 of three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL) for English language articles from 1995 to 2012 about human subjects. The search contained the following Medical Subject Headings: automatic data processing, blood transfusion, hospitals, laboratories, methods, patient identification systems, patients, and specimen handling as well as these keywords: barcode/bar-code/bar code, labeling errors, laboratory/ies, methods/strategy(ies) reduce patient specimen handling practice/identification errors, patient identification system errors, pharmaceutical, specimen, and transfusion.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>APPRAISE: Screen and Evaluate Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The ACQUIRE step search results are reviewed by an initial screening of titles and abstracts using pre-specified inclusion criteria consistent with the ASK step, followed by a full-text review of all eligible effectiveness studies, involving abstracting, standardizing and evaluating study quality using the LMBP methods. Included studies are considered to provide valid and useful information addressing the review question with barcoding effectiveness findings that include at least one ID error outcome measure. To reduce subjectivity and the potential for bias, all screening, abstraction and evaluation are conducted by at least two independent reviewers, and all reviewer discrepancies are resolved through consensus.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The ACQUIRE step procedures identified 1307 separate bibliographic records that were screened for eligibility to contribute evidence of the relation of barcoding with ID error outcomes. The APPRAISE step screening resulted in 1211 of these records being excluded as off-topic, and 73 being excluded for not meeting effectiveness study inclusion criteria (i.e., not a study, no barcoding practice, no ID error outcome measure) for a total of 23 full-text studies meeting the review inclusion criteria. A systematic review flow diagram in Figure 2 in the original guideline document provides a breakdown of the search results. Abstracted and standardized information as well as study quality ratings for the 23 eligible studies are provided in Appendix B in the original guideline document containing evidence summary tables preceded by a Body of Evidence table for each practice. Bibliographic reference information for these studies is provided in Appendix C in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The full-text review and evaluation of the 23 eligible studies resulted in the exclusion of 6 studies due to &quot;poor&quot; study quality ratings which did not meet the minimum required LMBP study quality inclusion criteria (4 barcoding system studies: 3 published and 1 unpublished; 2 point-of-care test barcoding studies: 1 published and 1 unpublished). A total of 17 studies are included in this review as evidence of practice effectiveness (8 of which are unpublished submissions): 10 studies for barcoding systems (3 unpublished) and 7 studies for point-of-care test barcoding (5 unpublished). All included studies used observational before&amp;ndash;after study designs.</p></div>"/>

<p>To reduce subjectivity and the potential for bias, all screening, abstraction and evaluation are conducted by at least two independent reviewers, and all reviewer discrepancies are resolved through consensus. The effect size for each study was standardized using its reported data and results to calculate an odds ratio (OR) since the outcome of interest is dichotomous (i.e., correctly identified versus misidentified) and the findings for these practices are typically expressed in terms of rates or percentages. The OR compares the barcoding practice to a non-barcoding practice in terms of the relative odds of a successful outcome (i.e., the patient's specimen and/or test is correctly identified versus incorrectly identified). Each study is assigned one of three quality ratings (Good, Fair, Poor) and one of three effect size ratings (Substantial, Moderate or Minimal/none).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>ANALYZE: Evidence Review Synthesis and Results</span></strong></p>
<p>The individual effectiveness study results from the APPRAISE step are aggregated into two practice-specific bodies of evidence (barcoding systems and point-of-care test [POCT] barcoding) and then analyzed to produce the systematic review practice effectiveness results for translation into evidence-based recommendations (Recommend, No recommendation for or against, Recommend against).</p>
<p>Both qualitative and quantitative analyses are used to assess effect size consistency and patterns of results across studies. Qualitative analysis is used to rate the overall strength of the body of evidence for practice effectiveness (High, Moderate, Suggestive, or Insufficient; see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The qualitative analysis synthesizes the individual studies to convey key study characteristics, results and evaluation findings summarized in a body of evidence table. A quantitative analysis is provided using meta-analysis of the results from similar individual studies to estimate a weighted average effect size and confidence interval using a random-effects model with the results presented in a forest plot.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Barcoding technology is not error free. ID errors associated with barcoding practices include those created by the patient identification barcodes themselves. Barcode scanners may misread patient identification barcodes due to incompatibility between the barcode print area size or symbology on patient ID bands or specimen labels with scanner settings. In one study a small number of scanner misreads occurred due to the narrow wrist band curvature of pediatric patients. Other sources of barcoding ID errors included labels being unreadable by a scanner due to label print quality problems, which may indicate a need for label printer maintenance, and degradation of the barcode on the patient ID band from being worn or written on. Studies and articles have also reported scanner failure attributable to low batteries. Even when the scanner works properly, incorrect information such as the wrong patient's barcode, incorrect barcode information from a patient's ID band, or non-patient identification barcodes (e.g., medication) can cause ID errors. A specific type of ID error is from scanning incorrect barcode information from a patient ID band with a barcode related to a previous hospitalization or a hospital transfer. Such an episode could include more than one armband and/or multiple patient accounts. Although many potential sources of ID errors associated with barcoding have been identified, these errors appear relatively rare, generally preventable, and likely have only a negligible impact on ID error rates.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Initiative (LMBP) systematic review methods are consistent with practice standards for systematic reviews, but all such methods are imperfect and include subjective assessments at multiple points that may produce bias. Like most systematic reviews, this one may be subject to publication bias, although this review includes unpublished studies which may mitigate that bias. The restriction to English language studies to satisfy the requirement of multiple reviewers for each study may also introduce bias if barcoding practices differ substantially in international settings. Quality improvement efforts typically differ from research, and are commonly observational studies that rely on natural experiments in realistic practice settings. The major drawback of these uncontrolled designs is that it is not possible to know if measured or unmeasured factors affect the outcomes of interest. Regardless of study design, by gathering evidence from multiple clinical and organizational settings, systematic reviews provide more useful assessments of the totality of evidence for a given quality improvement practice than individual studies.</p>
<p>Barcoding and other technology or practice changes may be easier to measure than individual step process changes that may contribute to observed results. Also, these processes are rarely uniform, and are clearly very different for clinical versus surgical pathology specimens, and for point-of-care testing. While these factors may moderate study findings and the observed heterogeneity suggests that they are not insignificant, it can be observed that all studies reported support for barcoding.</p>
<p>Some studies comprising the barcoding body of evidence involved less than full implementation for all or a portion of the post-implementation period which would have an expected tendency to understate the impact of barcoding on the reduction in ID error rates. In particular, some studies indicated barcoding &quot;scan rates&quot; of substantially less than 100% during the post-implementation period such that the effect of a non-barcoding practice (i.e., manual entry of patient identification information) is reflected in a portion of the post-implementation data. This was noted when provided, however as it was not always clearly or consistently reported it could not be used to adjust effect size estimates. As studies were done within a single institution, there may be many site-specific differences that impact their study results. Many studies were missing information including actual study sample sizes, dates for relevant time periods, and practice implementation and setting characteristics. Another perceived limitation is the inclusion of unpublished studies.</p>
<p>Designing and publishing controlled studies are typically not among the primary objectives of individuals collecting and analyzing quality improvement data relevant to laboratory medicine. In the barcoding body of evidence, both the published and unpublished studies had similar limitations. The LMBP experience to date in reviewing and rating study quality for both published and unpublished studies indicates that peer-reviewed journals do <em>not</em> provide assurance of high study quality.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Feasibility of Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence reviewed clearly demonstrates the feasibility of adopting barcoding practices in a variety of hospital settings. Nevertheless, each environment is distinctive and implementation requires adequate process development and modification, training, education and testing to achieve full effectiveness. Barcoding process design issues appear more complex for surgical pathology which typically involves more workflow process steps than patient specimens for routine laboratory or point-of-care testing. Many studies on surgical pathology describe the approach used for barcoding-related process changes in detail, along with the accompanying challenges and solutions. Key implementation components for making barcoding technology work as intended include adequate training and education, well-designed patient ID bands, and adequate supplies and equipment maintained in good working order (e.g., label printers, computers, batteries, wireless networks). Shortages and performance issues were noted as problems frustrating staff that can result in using error-prone work around processes. Support and involvement from all relevant departments and leaders including nursing, laboratory and information systems, were identified as critical success factors since no department typically has full ownership of implementing and using barcoding technology.</p></div>"/>
