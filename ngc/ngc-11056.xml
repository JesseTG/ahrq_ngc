	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations of Specific Types of Ulcer Treatment in the Management of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (Excluding Offloading)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the best way of debriding a diabetic foot ulcer?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Clean ulcers regularly with clean water or saline, debride them when possible in order to remove debris from the wound surface and dress them with a sterile, inert dressing in order to control excessive exudate and maintain a warm, moist environment in order to promote healing. (<strong>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] strength of recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence: Low</strong>) </li>
    <li>In general, remove slough, necrotic tissue and surrounding callus with sharp debridement in preference to other methods, taking relative contraindications such as severe ischemia into account. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What is the best dressing to use?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>Select dressings principally on the basis of exudate control, comfort and cost. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
    <li>Do not use antimicrobial dressings with the goal of improving wound healing or preventing secondary infection. (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Does systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy hasten wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Consider the use of systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy, even though further blinded and randomized trials are required to confirm its cost-effectiveness, as well as to identify the population most likely to benefit from its use. (<strong>Weak; Moderate</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Does topical negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) hasten healing in diabetic foot ulcers?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>Topical negative pressure wound therapy may be considered in post-operative wounds even though the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the approach remain to be established. (<strong>Weak; Moderate</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is there a place for the use of other topically applied treatments?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>
    <li>Do not select agents reported to improve wound healing by altering the biology of the wound, including growth factors, bioengineered skin products and gases, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is there a place for other local therapies to improve wound healing in the diabetic foot?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;8&quot;>
    <li>Do not select agents reported to have an impact on wound healing through alteration of the physical environment, including through the use of electricity, magnetism, ultrasound and shockwaves, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is there a place for other systemic therapies, including drugs and herbal therapies, in improving wound healing in the diabetic foot?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>Do not select systemic treatments reported to improve wound healing, including drugs and herbal therapies, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations in this guidance were formulated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence when writing a clinical guideline. The authors assessed the quality of evidence on the risk of bias of included studies, effect sizes, and expert opinion, and rated the quality of evidence as 'high,' 'moderate' or 'low.' They assessed the strength of each recommendation as 'strong' or 'weak,' based on the quality of evidence, balance between benefits and harm, patient values and preferences, and costs (resource utilization). The rationale behind each recommendation is described in the original guideline document. See the <a href=&quot;http://gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Web site&quot;>GRADE Web site</a> for more information.</p></div>"/>

<p>Controlled studies, which were either prospective or retrospective, published in any language, and which evaluated interventions for the treatment of chronic foot ulcers in people aged 18 years or older with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were considered. Studies were included if they concerned agents or interventions that may accelerate the healing process, and the primary outcomes used were clinical: healing, time to healing, and/or reduction in ulcer area. Search strategies (see Appendix A of the systematic review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) included selected search terms on study design, patient group, clinical problem and interventions of interest by using Medline (June 2010 to June 2014) and EMBASE (June 2010 to June 2014). Randomized controlled trials (RCTS), case-control studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, control before-and-after and interrupted time series designs were included. Bibliography tracking of identified articles was not performed. Previously performed high-quality systematic reviews and Cochrane reviews on the topics of interest were searched to determine the need for an extension to the literature search. A later search was made of the following clinical trials registries; the search terms used were Foot Ulcer; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Foot Ulcer; and Diabetic Foot: <a href=&quot;http://www.controlled-trials.com/&quot; title=&quot;ISRCTN Web site&quot;>http://www.controlled-trials.com/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;Clinicaltrials.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/trialsearch&quot; title=&quot;WHO ICTRP Web site&quot;>www.who.int/trialsearch</a>, <a href=&quot;http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/&quot; title=&quot;NIH Clinical Studies Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://cordis.europa.eu/en/home.html&quot; title=&quot;CORDIS Web site&quot;>cordis.europa.eu/en/home.html</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/&quot; title=&quot;EU Clinical Trials Web site&quot;>www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.pactr.org/&quot; title=&quot;PACTR Web site&quot;>www.pactr.org/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.anzctr.org.au/&quot; title=&quot;ANZTR Web site&quot;>www.anzctr.org.au/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.canadiancancertrials.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Canadian Cancer Trials Web site&quot;>www.canadiancancertrials.ca/</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/sms/about/our-departments/oncology/cancer-trials-nz.html&quot; title=&quot;Cancer Trials New Zealand&quot;>www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/sms/about/our-departments/oncology/cancer-trials-nz.html</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.chictr.org.cn/abouten.aspx&quot; title=&quot;ChiCTR Web site&quot;>www.chictr.org.cn/abouten.aspx</a>, <a href=&quot;http://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/search/basic_search.jsp&quot; title=&quot;CRIS Web site&quot;>cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/search/basic_search.jsp</a>, <a href=&quot;http://registroclinico.sld.cu/&quot; title=&quot;RPCEC Web site&quot;>registroclinico.sld.cu/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/&quot; title=&quot;DRKS Web site&quot;>drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.hkclinicaltrials.com/&quot; title=&quot;HKUCTR Web site&quot;>www.hkclinicaltrials.com/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.irct.ir/&quot; title=&quot;IRCT Web site&quot;>www.irct.ir/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/&quot; title=&quot;UMIN-CTR Web site&quot;>www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/</a>, www.kctr.se, <a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.health.nz/&quot; title=&quot;Clinical Trials New Zealand Web site&quot;>clinicaltrials.health.nz/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.sanctr.gov.za/SAClinicalTrials/tabid/169/Default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;South African National Clinical Trial Register Web site&quot;>www.sanctr.gov.za/SAClinicalTrials/tabid/169/Default.aspx</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.slctr.lk/&quot; title=&quot;SLCTR Web site&quot;>www.slctr.lk/</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/&quot; title=&quot;TCTR Web site&quot;>www.clinicaltrials.in.th/</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/&quot; title=&quot;UK Clinical Trials Gateway Web site&quot;>www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/</a> and www.controlled-trials.com/ukctr/, and attempts were made to contact investigators if there was no evidence of publication of relevant studies.</p>

<p>Each study was scored for methodological quality using scoring lists specific for each study design and based on checklists developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). Equal weighting was applied to each validity criterion. Findings on data extraction and methodological quality were discussed between co-reviewers and a final decision endorsed by the entire group. Quality items were rated as 'done', 'not done' or 'not reported', and only those rated as 'done' contributed to methodological quality score. This quality score was translated into a level of evidence according to the SIGN instrument: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and (2) studies with case-control, cohort, control before and after or interrupted time series design. Studies were also rated as ++ (well conducted with very low risk of bias), + (well conducted with low risk of bias) and &amp;minus; (low quality with higher risk of bias). Meta-analyses, other reviews and studies reporting non-analytic case reports and case series were not included. Reviewers did not assess their own work because of potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Extracted data were summarized in evidence tables on a study-by-study narrative basis. Because of the heterogeneity of study designs, including interventions, follow-up and outcomes, no attempt was made to pool the results. The evidence tables were compiled following collective discussion by the working party, and conclusions were drawn. The papers selected for scoring were divided into the same ten categories as the 2012 review, except that the articles on the use of platelet-derived growth factors have now been included in the section on cell therapy (in contrast to the previous allocation to the section on wound biochemistry); the section on oxygen has been expanded to include other gases.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The guideline recommendations are derived from critical systematic review of all relevant publications, but this process has its limitations, and these must be borne in mind. The first is that the reviews sought evidence specifically that an intervention may improve healing (and only of foot ulcers complicating diabetes &amp;ndash; and not of other wounds, whether acute or chronic). As, however, the process of healing is a highly complex one, involving the interaction of many different cell types and signalling pathways, it is likely that the benefit of the majority of specific interventions is limited to a particular type of wound and to a particular phase in the healing process. As the process tends to last for weeks or months, this means that the impact of any beneficial effect of a therapy may not be apparent. It is also important to consider whether the benefit of a therapy has been demonstrated in people who are also receiving usual best care, including adequate offloading in those with ulcers on weight-bearing areas of the foot. </li>
    <li>If, however, studies are of insufficient duration to assess complete healing of an ulcer as an outcome measure, it may be possible to use a surrogate measure &amp;ndash; such as percentage reduction in wound area over 4 weeks, which has been shown to correlate with, and to be predictive of, the incidence of eventual healing. The adoption of such a surrogate measure will reduce the chance of a short-term response to an intervention being obscured by the complexity of the overall healing process. Demonstration of benefit in such short-duration studies could then be used as the foundation for further work designed to determine the specific population and circumstances in which the use of the intervention is likely to be beneficial. </li>
    <li>Ultimately, however, the clinical endpoint of care is to accelerate complete healing of chronic ulcers of the foot in diabetes, and this must be demonstrated if any treatment is to be generally recommended. Hitherto, such recommendation has not been possible because of the limitations both in extent and, in many cases, in quality of reported studies. </li>
