	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Participants</em></p>
<p>Study populations eligible for inclusion were:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Adults (&amp;ge;18 years) with known (previously diagnosed who have symptoms that are no longer controlled by drug treatment and/or who are being considered for revascularisation) or suspected (chest pain or other suggestive symptoms) coronary artery disease (CAD), who are difficult to image (not currently candidates for CT imaging). Difficult or impossible to image patient groups defined <em>a priori</em> were:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Obesity (body mass index [BMI]&amp;ge;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) </li>
        <li>High levels of coronary calcium (calcium score &amp;gt;400) </li>
        <li>Arrhythmias (including, but not limited to atrial fibrillation [AF]) </li>
        <li>High heart rate (HHR) (&amp;gt;65 bpm) </li>
        <li>Intolerance of beta-blockers </li>
        <li>Previous stent implantation </li>
        <li>Previous bypass graft(s)
        <p>Difficult or impossible to image patients were not limited to these patient groups, but no other groups were identified during the review process. Following consultation with clinical experts, the definition of HHR (&amp;gt;70 bpm) specified in the protocol was broadened to avoid potential loss of relevant data, as identified studies frequently defined HHR as &amp;gt;65 bpm.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Infants, children and adults diagnosed with complex congenital heart disease, including but not limited to:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Pulmonary atresia with major aortopulmonary collaterals (MAPCA) </li>
        <li>Variants of anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage [TAPVD], Scimitar syndrome, etc.) </li>
        <li>Aortic arch abnormalities (double aortic arch, vascular ring, etc.) </li>
        <li>Lesions with both a vascular and airway component (pulmonary artery sling, tracheal stenosis, right aortic arch with aberrant subclavian artery, etc.) </li>
        <li>Previously treated lesions where stents or pacemakers make magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) an unsuitable imaging strategy </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Setting</em></p>
<p>Relevant settings were secondary or tertiary care.</p>
<p><em>Interventions</em></p>
<p>Included interventions, described as 'NGCCT' (new generation cardiac computed tomography scanner) throughout, were the following CT scanners:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Discovery CT750 </li>
    <li>Brilliance iCT </li>
    <li>Somatom Definition Flash </li>
    <li>Aquilion One </li>
</ul>
<p>No additional equivalent technologies were identified during the review process.</p>
<p><em>Comparators</em></p>
<p>The only relevant comparator for the assessment of difficult to image CAD patients was invasive coronary angiography (ICA).</p>
<p>Relevant comparators, for the assessment of complex congenital heart disease, were 64-slice CT, or conventional imaging (without CT).</p>
<p><em>Reference Standard</em></p>
<p>Studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of NGCCT for the detection of significant CAD were required to use ICA as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was not considered a relevant outcome for studies of congenital heart disease.</p>
<p><em>Outcomes</em></p>
<p>Studies reporting the following outcomes were considered relevant for both clinical applications (CAD and congenital heart disease):</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Impact of testing on treatment plan (e.g., surgical or medical management), where information on the appropriateness of the final treatment plan was also reported </li>
    <li>Impact of testing on clinical outcome (e.g., angina, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality) </li>
</ul>
<p>Studies reporting the following outcomes were considered relevant for difficult to image CAD patients only:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Test accuracy </li>
    <li>Indeterminacy (test failure rate) </li>
</ul>
<p>For included studies reporting any of the above outcome measures, the following outcomes were also recorded, if reported:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Acceptability of tests to patients </li>
    <li>Adverse events associated with testing </li>
    <li>Radiation dose associated with imaging </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Study Design</em></p>
<p>The following study designs were eligible for inclusion:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Randomised or non-randomised controlled trials, where participants were assigned to the intervention or comparator tests, for treatment planning, and outcomes were compared at follow-up </li>
    <li>Randomised or non-randomised controlled trials where participants were assigned to conventional imaging only, or conventional imaging plus high definition or 64-slice CT (congenital heart disease only). </li>
</ul>
<p>No randomised or non-randomised controlled trials were identified. Therefore, the following observational study types were considered eligible for inclusion:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cross-sectional test accuracy studies, where the intervention was compared with the reference standard (CAD only) </li>
    <li>Observational studies reporting change to treatment plan or clinical outcome subsequent to high definition CT (CAD and congenital heart disease), or 64-slice CT (congenital heart disease only). </li>
</ul>
<p>Cross-sectional test accuracy studies were required to report the absolute numbers of true positive, false negative, false positive, and true negative test results, or sufficient information to allow their calculation.</p>
<p>The following study/publication types were excluded:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Pre-clinical, animal and phantom studies </li>
    <li>Reviews, editorials, and opinion pieces </li>
    <li>Case reports </li>
    <li>Studies reporting only technical aspects of the test, or image quality </li>
    <li>Studies with &amp;lt;10 participants </li>

<p>Searches were undertaken to identify studies of NGCCT in the diagnosis of CAD and assessment of congenital heart disease. Search strategies were developed specifically for each database and the keywords associated with CAD and congenital heart defects were adapted according to the configuration of each database. Searches took into account generic and other product names for the intervention. No restrictions on language or publication status were applied. Limits were applied to remove animal studies. Full search strategies are reported in Appendix 1 in the DAR (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Identified references were downloaded in Endnote X4 software for further assessment and handling. References in retrieved articles were checked for additional studies.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Screening</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by searches and any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus. Full copies of all studies deemed potentially relevant, after discussion, were obtained and the same two reviewers independently assessed these for inclusion; any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Details of studies excluded at the full paper screening stage are presented in Appendix 5 in the DAR (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Studies listed in submissions from the manufacturers of NGCCT were first checked against the project reference database, in Endnote X4; any studies not already identified by the searches were screened for inclusion following the process described above. Studies referenced by manufacturers and excluded at the full paper screening stage are noted in Appendix 5 in the DAR (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Appendix 5 also includes a list of studies, referenced by manufacturers, which were excluded at title and abstract screening.</p>

The DAR for this guidance was prepared by Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd. (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Data were extracted on: study details (study design, participant recruitment, setting, funding, stated objective, and categories of participants relevant to this assessment for whom data were reported); study participants (total number of participants, number of participants in each relevant group, study inclusion criteria, study exclusion criteria, and participant characteristics relevant to cardiovascular risk for the relevant participant groups or the whole study population); assessed technology and reference standard (technical details of the test, any use of &amp;beta;-blockers prior to scanning, details of who interpreted tests and how, threshold used to define a positive test); study results. All studies included in the review were diagnostic accuracy studies and the results extracted were: unit of analysis (patient, artery, or arterial segment; numbers of true positive, false negative, false positive, and true negative test results; numbers of patients, arteries, or segments classified as non-diagnostic by new generation cardiac computed tomography (NGCCT) scanners; radiation exposure associated with imaging. All data were extracted by one reviewer, using a piloted, standard data extraction form and checked by a second; any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Full data extraction tables are provided in Appendix 4 in the DAR (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>All studies included in the systematic review were test accuracy studies. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy studies (QUADAS) tool is recommended for assessing the methodological quality of test accuracy studies. However, a revised version of QUADAS (QUADAS-2) was published in 2011 (<a href=&quot;http://www.bris.ac.uk/quadas/&quot; title=&quot;QUADAS Web site&quot;>www.quadas.org</a>). QUADAS-2 more closely resembles the approach and structure of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. QUADAS-2 separates bias from external validity (applicability) and does not include any items which only assess reporting quality. Guidance for the use of QUADAS-2 will emphasise the need to tailor the tool to specific projects and the need to avoid the use of summary quality scores.</p>
<p>Review-specific guidance was produced for the use of QUADAS-2 in this assessment and is reported in Appendix 2 in the DAR (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The results of the quality assessment are summarised and presented in tables and graphs in Section 5.6 in the DAR and are presented in full, by study, in Appendix 3 in the DAR (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). No diagnostic accuracy data set included in this assessment was of sufficient size to allow statistical exploration of between study heterogeneity based on aspects of risk of bias. The findings of the quality assessment were also used to inform recommendations for future research.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Analysis/Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>All studies included in the systematic review were test accuracy studies in difficult to image coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Results were summarised by patient group (e.g., obese, high heart rate, high coronary calcium score, etc.) and further stratified by unit of analysis (patient, artery, or arterial segment). For all included studies, the absolute numbers of true positive, false negative, false positive and true negative test results, as well as sensitivity and specificity values, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented in results tables, for each patient group reported. Data on the numbers of non-diagnostic tests and radiation exposure were also included in the results tables and described in text summaries.</p>
<p>Where groups of similar studies (same patient group and unit of analysis) included four or more data sets, summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves and summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, with 95% CIs were calculated using the bivariate modelling approach; four data sets are the minimum requirement to fit models of this type. Analyses were conducted in STATA 10, using the 'metandi' function. In two cases, a bivariate model could not be fitted because the number of studies was small (four), 2 x 2 data contained one or more zero values, and between study heterogeneity was low. In these cases pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity, with 95% CIs, were calculated using a random effects model; these analyses were conducted using MetaDiSc 1.4, and forest plots were constructed, showing the sensitivity and specificity estimates from each study together with pooled estimates. No distinction was made between patients with known or suspected CAD as per patient data sets were generally small, with low to moderate between study heterogeneity. In addition, 'known' and 'suspected' CAD were often poorly defined by the included studies.</p>
<p>Between study heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-squared test and inconsistency was quantified using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. There were no data sets of sufficient size (minimum ten) to allow statistical exploration of sources of heterogeneity by including additional co-variables in the SROC model.</p>
<p>Where meta-analysis was considered unsuitable for the data identified (e.g., due to the heterogeneity and/or small numbers of studies), studies were summarised using a narrative synthesis. Text and tables were stratified by patient group.</p>
<p>No data were identified on the effects of NGCCT on treatment planning and/or clinical outcome, adverse events associated with testing, or acceptability of tests to patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Model Structure and Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of NGCCT for difficult to image patient groups is estimated for two CAD populations: the suspected CAD population and the known CAD population. Patients suspected of CAD are patients who have chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of CAD. Patients with known CAD are patients who have previously been diagnosed with CAD and whose symptoms are no longer controlled by drug treatment and/or being considered for revascularisation. The use of NGCCT has different purposes in the two CAD populations: for the suspected CAD population the purpose is to diagnose patients with CAD and for the known CAD population the purpose is to decide if a revascularisation is necessary.</p>
<p>Five models were combined to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the NGCCT:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A decision tree that models the diagnostic pathway (Diagnostic model) </li>
    <li>A life&amp;ndash;death Markov model for &quot;healthy&quot; patients without CAD (Healthy population Markov model) </li>
    <li>A simple stroke model to estimate the impact of test and treatment related stroke (stroke model) </li>
    <li>A model for the prognosis of patients with CAD </li>
    <li>A model constructed by the Centre for Health Economics, University of York to model the impact of imaging due to radiation on cancer morbidity and mortality, hereafter referred to as the York Radiation Model (YRM) </li>
</ul>
<p>The comparator used for the evaluation of suspected or known CAD in difficult or impossible to image patients was invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Three strategies were evaluated in this assessment. The first strategy (ICA-only) is a strategy where patients with suspected or known CAD only undergo an ICA. While ICA is the reference standard test and is assumed to be 100% sensitive and specific, it is associated with a risk of serious complications, including death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. NGCCT does not have a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and thus is less accurate than the ICA. The second strategy (NGCCT-ICA) evaluates the combination of cardiac CT using the new generation technologies and ICA. Cardiac CT is first performed in all patients and patients with a positive CT scan then undergo an ICA. This additional test will reveal any patients with a false positive CT test result, but it also provides other information that a CT currently does not. The third strategy (NGCCT only) uses only NGCCT to diagnose patients.</p>
<p>The five models used in the analyses are described, in detail, in Section 6 of the DAR. The stochastic analyses are based on cohort simulations. To investigate decision uncertainty, second-order uncertainty micro-simulations were run.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Developing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>After reviewing the evidence the Diagnostic Advisory Committee (DAC) agrees draft recommendations on the use of the technology in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. When formulating these recommendations, the Committee has discretion to consider those factors it believes are most appropriate to the evaluation. In doing so, the Committee has regard to any relevant provisions of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Directions, set out by the Secretary of State for Health, and legislation on human rights, discrimination and equality. In undertaking evaluations of healthcare technologies, NICE takes into account the broad balance of clinical benefits and costs, the degree of clinical need of patients under consideration, any guidance issued to the NHS by the Secretary of State that is specifically drawn to the attention of NICE by the Secretary of State, and any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, and the potential for long-term benefits to the NHS of innovation.</p>
<p>The Committee takes into account advice from NICE on the approach it should take to making scientific and social value judgements. Advice on social value judgements is informed in part by the work of NICE's Citizens Council.</p>
<p>The Committee takes into account how its judgements have a bearing on distributive justice or legal requirements in relation to human rights, discrimination and equality. Such characteristics include, but are not confined to: race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender reassignment and pregnancy or maternity.</p>
<p>The Committee considers the application of other Board-approved NICE methods policies, such as the supplementary guidance on discounting and the end-of-life criteria, if they are relevant to the evaluation.</p>
<p>Because the Programme often evaluates new technologies that have a thin evidence base, in formulating its recommendations the Committee balances the quality and quantity of evidence with the expected value of the technology to the NHS and the public.</p>
<p>The credibility of the guidance produced by NICE depends on the transparency of the DAC's decision-making process. It is crucial that the DAC's decisions are explained clearly, and that the contributions of registered stakeholders and the views of members of the public are considered. The reasoning behind the Committee's recommendations is explained, with reference to the factors that have been taken into account.</p>
<p>The language and style used in the documents produced by the Committee are governed by the following principles:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clarity is essential in explaining how the DAC has come to its conclusions. </li>
    <li>The text of the documents does not need to reiterate all the factual information that can be found in the information published alongside the guidance. This needs careful judgement so that enough information and justification is given in the recommendations to enable the reader to understand what evidence the DAC considered and, if appropriate, who provided that evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Committee may take into account factors that may provide benefits to the NHS or the population, such as patient convenience. It may also consider costs and other positive or negative impacts on the NHS that may not be captured in the reference-case cost analysis, such as improved processes.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Models were used to estimate the costs of the diagnostic tests and treatments people received for their initial conditions and any subsequent related conditions that developed. Although there is some variation in the costs of the new generation cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanners, the models assumed that each scanner cost &amp;pound;1 million.</p>
<p>The comparator, invasive coronary angiography, was presumed to be perfectly accurate (a gold standard) and, despite a known increase in complication rate compared with CT, generated more quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains than CT. It was also more expensive than imaging with a new generation cardiac CT scanner. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of invasive angiography when compared with new generation cardiac CT is significantly greater than the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold.</p>
<p>In people with suspected coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult, the health economic analysis showed that, given a threshold of &amp;pound;20,000 per QALY gained, using new generation cardiac CT scanners instead of invasive coronary angiography is cost-effective. The 'new generation CT scanner only' strategy was the most cost-effective strategy. The 'new generation CT scan plus invasive coronary angiography for those with positive CT scans' strategy delivered very small additional QALYS per patient (0.002) at a cost of &amp;pound;142. The incremental ICER was &amp;pound;71,000 per QALY gained compared to the 'new generation CT scanner only' strategy. Similarly, relative to the 'new generation CT scanner only' strategy, 'invasive coronary angiography alone' also delivered a very small number of additional QALYS per patient (0.009) at a cost of &amp;pound;726 (ICER of &amp;pound;80,667 per QALY gained).</p>
<p>In people with known coronary artery disease who are difficult to image, the most cost-effective strategy was 'new generation cardiac CT scan plus invasive coronary angiography' for those with positive CT scans. This strategy dominated (more effective and less costly) the 'invasive coronary angiography only' strategy, generating more QALYs per patient (0.022) at reduced cost. The 'new generation cardiac CT scan plus invasive coronary angiography' strategy was the most preferred strategy for this cohort. Although it generated a very small reduction in QALYs per patient (0.001), it yielded a relatively large reduction in cost (&amp;pound;443) (ICER &amp;pound;726,230 per QALY) relative to the 'new generation cardiac CT scan only.</p>
