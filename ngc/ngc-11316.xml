	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based, Formal consensus, Informal consensus, No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the best intervals between dosing of zoledronic acid? </strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation</em>. As recommended in the 2011 version of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) bone-modifying agents (BMAs) guideline, patients with breast cancer who have evidence of bone metastases should be treated with BMAs. One BMA is not recommended over another. If patients are treated with zoledronic acid, 4 mg intravenously administered over no less than 15 minutes, dosing options are every 12 weeks or every 3 to 4 weeks (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases? </strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation</em>. The analgesic effects of BMAs (denosumab, pamidronate, or zoledronic acid) are modest, and BMAs should not be used alone for bone pain. The Update Committee recommends that the current standard of care for supportive care and pain management be applied. This can include analgesia, adjunct therapies, radiotherapy, surgery, systemic anticancer therapy, and referral to supportive care and pain management. Evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit is insufficient to support the use of one BMA over another. Further research is needed on this clinical question (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>

<p>The Update Committee conducted a search of the PubMed database to identify systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that addressed the role of bone-modifying agents (BMAs) in the management of metastatic breast cancer. The review of the yield from this search focused on publications that reported on 4-week and 12-week intervals between the dosing of zoledronic acid and the role of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases.</p>
<p>The PubMed search (from January 2011 to March 2017) conducted to identify publications that reported on studies of the optimal intervals between BMA dosing and studies addressing the role of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases yielded 273 records.</p>
<p>To inform the special commentary on cost considerations, the Update Committee conducted an additional targeted PubMed literature search to identify articles reporting on the results of cost-effectiveness analyses of BMAs. This search was limited to non&amp;ndash;industry-supported studies.</p>
<p>The PubMed literature search (2003 to July 2016) performed to identify articles reporting on the results of cost-effectiveness analyses of BMAs yielded 32 records; however, none of the publications provided new evidence to inform the special commentary on cost considerations. A bibliography of the results of the cost-effectiveness literature search is provided in Data Supplement 3 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, and community oncology. The panel included a member of Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel. </p>
<p>For this joint ASCO-Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) focused guideline update, CCO appointed formal representatives.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Update Process</span></strong> </p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updating. This approach identifies new, potentially practice-changing data&amp;mdash;signals&amp;mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on targeted literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. </p>
<p>For this focused update, a set of three phase III randomized noninferiority trials addressing dosing interval of zoledronic acid provided the signal. Primarily on the basis of this signal, the ASCO Breast Cancer Advisory Group ranked updating the guideline on bone-modifying agents (BMAs) in metastatic breast cancer among its highest priorities. To that end, ASCO and CCO convened a joint Update Committee to review the evidence and to formulate updated recommendations for practice. With the approval of the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group, the Update Committee expanded the guideline scope to include a commentary on cost considerations in the use of BMAs in patients with metastatic breast cancer. </p>
<p>The entire Update Committee contributed to the development of the guideline, provided critical review, and finalized the guideline recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong> </p>
<p>The full Update Committee met once and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were rated, in part, using the principles of the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology.</p></div>"/>

    <li>In three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the comparisons between dosing the bone-modifying agents (BMAs) every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks showed a similar rate of skeletal complications as measured by proportion of skeletal-related events (SREs) or skeletal morbidity rates (SMRs) between the 4-week and 12-week dosing study arms. SREs are defined as fracture, radiation, or surgery to bone or spinal cord compression. One of the studies also included hypercalcemia as an SRE. SMR is defined as the number of SREs over time. </li>
