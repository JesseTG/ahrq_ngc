	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Question 1</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Indications for Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: Thin melanomas: Routine SLN biopsy is not recommended for patients with melanomas that are T1a (nonulcerated lesions &amp;lt;0.8 mm in Breslow thickness). SLN biopsy may be considered for T1b patients (0.8 to 1.0 mm Breslow thickness or &amp;lt;0.8 mm Breslow thickness with ulceration) after a thorough discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risk of harms associated with the procedure (Type of recommendation: evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risk of harms; Quality of evidence: low to intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: Intermediate-thickness melanomas: SLN biopsy is recommended for patients with melanomas that are T2 or T3 (Breslow thickness of &amp;gt;1.0 to 4.0 mm; Type of recommendation: evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risks of harm; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: Thick melanomas: SLN biopsy may be recommended for patients with melanomas that are T4 (&amp;gt;4.0 mm in Breslow thickness), after a thorough discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risks of harm associated with the procedure (Type of recommendation: Evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risks of harm; Quality of evidence: low to intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Question 2</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Role of Completion Lymph Node Dissection (CLND)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: CLND or careful observation are options for patients with low-risk micrometastatic disease, with due consideration of clinicopathological factors. For higher risk patients, careful observation may be considered only after a thorough discussion with patients about the potential risks and benefits of forgoing CLND (Type of recommendation: evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risks of harm; Quality of evidence: intermediate to high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review based on the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 1</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients with primary cutaneous melanoma without clinical evidence of lymph node involvement </li>
    <li>Subgroups of interest: Patients with melanoma of varying Breslow thickness, including thin (&amp;le;1.0 mm), intermediate (&amp;gt;1.0 to 4.0 mm), and thick (&amp;gt;4.0 mm) </li>
    <li>Intervention: Wide excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy </li>
    <li>Comparison: Wide excision and nodal observation </li>
    <li>Outcomes: Melanoma-specific survival, disease-free survival, recurrence, variation in rate of SLN positivity according to established risk factors (e.g., ulceration, mitotic rate), morbidity </li>
    <li>Eligible study designs: Systematic reviews, randomized and nonrandomized studies </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients with newly diagnosed primary cutaneous melanoma </li>
    <li>Intervention: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) after a positive SLN biopsy </li>
    <li>Comparison: Observation (no CLND) after a positive SLN biopsy </li>
    <li>Outcomes: Survival (melanoma-specific, disease-free), regional disease control, operative morbidity </li>
    <li>Eligible study designs: For the previous version of this guideline, the Expert Panel stated that the results of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were awaited and would inform the recommendation related to CLND after positive SLN biopsy; therefore, the standard for clinical question 2 was limited to phase III RCTs. </li>
</ul>
<p>PubMed was searched from September 2011 to June 16, 2017. Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews; (3) published in a non-English language. In addition, because sentinel node status has already been established as a prognostic indicator and has been incorporated into the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, studies reporting outcomes related to the prognostic significance of a positive sentinel node were excluded. Test performance characteristics of SLN biopsy, e.g., false negative rates, were considered to have already been established; therefore, studies reporting only these outcomes were also excluded from this guideline update. To avoid duplication, data were not extracted from studies that were included in eligible systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p></div>"/>

Based upon the consideration of the evidence from a systematic review of the literature conducted by a trained methodologist, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations.

In addition, a guideline implementability review is conducted. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the methods used to develop this update is available in the Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), including an overview (e.g., panel composition, development process and revision dates; the recommendation development process [GLIDES and BRIDGE-Wiz]; and quality assessment).</p></div>"/>

    <li>Knowledge of regional lymph node status helps to determine prognosis, facilitates strategies for regional disease control, and aids in the selection of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that accurately detects nodal metastases in patients with clinically occult disease. </li>
    <li>SLN biopsy has been found to be useful for intermediate-thickness melanoma, based on results from a meta-analysis that showed low false-negative rates and high rates of sentinel node detection.</li>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy I (MSLT-I), the most common complications after sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy resolved over time and included seroma (5.5%), infection (4.6%) and wound separation (1.2%). A more recent meta-analysis reported an overall complication rate of 4.6%.</li>
    <li>Data from MSLT-I demonstrated a higher risk of lymphedema with completion lymph node dissection (CLND) when disease is detected clinically during follow-up; however, patients were not closely followed with nodal ultrasound in that study.</li>
    <li>Adverse events such as lymphedema were more common in the CLND group than in the observation group in MSLT-II (24.1% v 6.3%).</li>
    <li>In the German Dermatologic Oncology Cooperative Group (DeCOG-SLT) trial, adverse events occurred in 24% of 240 patients, including &amp;ge;grade 3 adverse events in 14% of patients. Grade 3 and 4 events included lymphedema (n = 20), lymph fistula (n = 3), seroma (n = 3), infection (n = 3), and delayed wound healing (n = 5). </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
