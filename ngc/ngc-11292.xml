	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI)</strong>: The recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis are presented in the form of a table with a list of evidence-based recommendations and an algorithm, accompanied by detailed annotations. The algorithms are provided in the original guideline document at the ICSI Web site for Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteoporosis (see the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field). In addition, ungraded Work Group Consensus Recommendations on bone mineral density (BMD) screening, shared decision making, and further risk assessment can be found in the Recommendation Table in the original guideline document. </p>
<p>Class of evidence (<strong>Low Quality</strong>, <strong>Moderate Quality</strong>, and <strong>High Quality</strong>) and strength of recommendation (<strong>Weak </strong>or <strong>Strong</strong>) definitions are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Counseling on Lifestyle Modification</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Primary prevention and treatment for low bone density should include counseling on lifestyle modification regarding nutrition, physical activity, smoking and alcohol. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Lifestyle modifications can improve bone mineral density. They also have positive implications for many other health conditions. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: There is no harm in counseling patients on self-management of lifestyle factors. One consideration from a resource perspective is time needed for clinicians to have these conversations. However, because nutrition, physical activity, smoking and alcohol affect health in many ways, this time is well spent as a prevention tool. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefit of discussing lifestyle factors with patients far exceed any negligible harms related to time and resources. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Hannan et al., 2000; Huopio et al., 2000; H&amp;oslash;idrup et al., 1999; Ulrich et al., 1999 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: When available, central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the preferred method for assessing bone mineral density. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: DXA is widely available, non-invasive, and has low radiation exposure. Most of the trials on pharmacologic therapy utilized DXA as the diagnostic tool for osteoporosis. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: There is radiation exposure for DXA, which, although small, is still present. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harm Assessment</strong>: The benefits of DXA as a diagnostic tool outweigh the small risk of radiation that is involved. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resource</strong>: Hailey et al., 1998 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacologic Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Bisphosphonates should be considered (unless contraindicated) for reduction of fracture risk (both vertebral and non-vertebral) in:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis </li>
    <li>Men with osteoporosis </li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>Quality of Evidence: Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [High]; Men with osteoporosis [Moderate]; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Bisphosphonates have been shown to improve bone mineral density and reduce the incidence of fracture. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: As with any medication, bisphosphonates may be associated with side effects. While rare, osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious adverse effect of bisphosphonates, as are atypical femur fractures. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harm Assessment</strong>: For most patients with osteoporosis, the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks. However, the benefit-harm assessment should be done for each individual patient to evaluate whether this medication is appropriate. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: Eriksen, Diez-Perez, &amp;amp; Boonen, 2014; Miller et al., 2012; Eisman et al., 2008; Black et al., 2007; Chestnut et al., 2005; Chestnut et al., 2004; McClung et al., 2001; Black et al., 2000; Fogelman et al., 2000; Harris et al., 1999 </li>

<p>The development process is based on a number of long-proven approaches and is continually being revised based on changing community standards. The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) staff, in consultation with the work group and a medical librarian, conduct a literature search to identify systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, other guidelines, regulatory statements and other pertinent literature. This literature is evaluated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology by work group members. When needed, an outside methodologist is consulted. </p>
<p>The work group uses this information to develop or revise clinical flows and algorithms, write recommendations, and identify gaps in the literature. The work group gives consideration to the importance of many issues as they develop the guideline. These considerations include the systems of care in our community and how resources vary, the balance between benefits and harms of interventions, patient and community values, the autonomy of clinicians and patients and more. All decisions made by the work group are done using a consensus process. </p>
<p>ICSI's medical group members and sponsors review each guideline as part of the revision process. They provide comment on the scientific content, recommendations and implementation strategies. This feedback is used by and responded to by the work group as part of their revision work. Final review and approval of the guideline is done by ICSI's Committee on Evidence-Based Practice. This committee is made up of practicing clinicians and nurses, drawn from ICSI member medical groups. </p>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Shared decision-making (SDM) offers an opportunity to help the patient select a treatment to which they can adhere. When conversations discussing options occurs, patients and clinicians are actively engaged while considering the attributes and issues of the available options. This empathic approach results in the clinician and patient co-creating a decision and a plan of care. </li>
    <li>Physical activity, particularly weight-bearing exercise, is thought to provide the mechanical stimuli, or &quot;loading,&quot; important for the maintenance and improvement of bone health. Resistance training may have more profound site-specific effect than aerobic exercise. High-intensity resistance training may have added benefits for decreasing fracture risks by improving strength and balance, and increasing muscle mass. High-impact exercise and weight training stimulate accrual of bone mineral content in the skeleton. </li>
    <li>Randomized clinical trials have shown exercise to decrease the risk of falls by approximately 25%. Stronger back extensor muscles have been shown to decrease the risk of vertebral fractures independent of pharmacotherapy. Those who exercise may fall differently and decrease their fracture risk as a result. </li>
    <li>Comprehensive reviews of the relationship of calcium intake and bone health reported that sufficient amounts of calcium slows age-related bone loss and may reduce osteoporotic fracture risk. </li>
    <li>Studies concerning vitamin D and bone health demonstrate daily vitamin D supplementation in the range of 700-800 international units can decrease hip fracture risk in the elderly by 26% and any non-vertebral fracture by 23%. </li>
    <li>Limiting alcohol use to no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men will help to protect bone health and reduce the risk of falls. </li>
    <li>Anti-resorptive agents (bisphosphonates)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Alendronate (in both daily and weekly preparations) has been shown to increase BMD and reduce the incidence of vertebral, hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women having existing vertebral fractures, and those with low BMD compared to placebo (calcium and vitamin D). </li>
        <li>Risedronate, also available in daily and weekly preparations, has shown a 41% risk reduction in the number of new vertebral fractures after three years compared to placebo in the VERT trial. </li>
        <li>Daily and intermittent dosing of ibandronate has been shown to improve BMD and reduce vertebral fractures in 2,946 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures, compared with calcium and vitamin D alone. </li>
        <li>Zoledronic acid improved BMD and decreased bone turnover markers for three years in the pivotal fracture trial. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Adherence to therapy was associated with significantly fewer fractures at 24 months. Follow-up phone calls or visits have shown improvement in adherence. </li>

    <li>Spinal flexion exercises have demonstrated an increased risk of vertebral fractures. </li>
    <li>Taking calcium carbonate supplements on an empty stomach may increase the risk of kidney stones and may not be well absorbed. Over supplementation may be associated with an increased risk of kidney stones and vascular calcification. </li>
    <li>Bisphosphonates have the potential to cause abdominal pain, flatulence, indigestion, diarrhea, headache, fever, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), gastric ulcer, esophageal erosion, esophagitis, dysphagia, atypical fractures, rash, constipation, nausea, arthralgia, peripheral edema, myalgia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, backache, pain in limb, bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, fatigue, asthenia, dizziness, atrial fibrillation, cardiac dysrhythmia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypocalcemia, aseptic necrosis of bone of jaw. </li>
    <li>Adverse reaction to RANK ligand (RANKL) inhibitor include hypercholesterolemia, vomiting, anemia, arthralgia, backache, pain in limb, asthenia, cystitis, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, fatigue, endocarditis, cellulitis, dermatitis, hypocalcemia, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, aseptic necrosis of bone of jaw, atypical fracture of femur and vertebral column, cancer. </li>
    <li>Recombinant parathyroid hormone (teriparatide) is shown to cause an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma in male and female rats, dependent on dose and duration of treatment, hypotension, syncope, rash, sweating symptoms, hyperuricemia, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, spasm, asthenia, dizziness, rhinitis, increasing frequency of cough, pharyngitis, angina pectoris. </li>
    <li>Raloxifene (Evista) carries the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, hot sweats, leg cramp, and cerebrovascular accident. </li>
    <li>Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene acetate (Duavee) carries a risk of endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders and probable dementia. Other side effects include diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, upper abdominal pain, neck pain, spasm, dizziness, pain in throat, venous thromboembolism (VTE), cerebrovascular accident, retinal vascular disorder, primary malignant neoplasm of endometrium. </li>
