	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Comprehensive Pediatric Eye and Vision Examination </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Examination Procedures*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: A comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination should include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Review of the nature and history of the presenting problem, patient and family eye and medical histories, including visual, ocular, general health, leisure and sports activities, and developmental and school performance history of the child </li>
    <li>Measurement of visual acuity </li>
    <li>Determination of refractive status </li>
    <li>Assessment of binocular vision, ocular motility, and accommodation </li>
    <li>Evaluation of color vision (baseline or periodic, if needed, for qualification purposes or if disease related) </li>
    <li>Assessment of ocular and systemic health, including evaluation of pupillary responses, anterior and posterior segment, peripheral retina, evaluation/measurement of intraocular pressure, and visual field testing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to section III. Care Process, A. 9 in the original guideline document for a listing of potential benefits and harms of testing.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of all of the tests and/or assessments included in this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in the enhanced ability to diagnose any eye or vision problems in infants and children. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Testing of Preschool Children (3 through 5 years of age)</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Refraction</span></p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: Cycloplegic retinoscopy is the preferred procedure for the first evaluation of preschoolers. It is necessary to quantify significant refractive error in the presence of visual conditions such as strabismus, amblyopia, and anisometropia.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to enhance the ability to evaluate and diagnose eye and vision problems in school-age children. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Testing of School-Age Children (6 through 18 years of age)</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Refraction</span></p>
<p><strong>Consensus-based Action Statement</strong>: Cycloplegic retinoscopy is the preferred procedure for the first evaluation of school-age children.

<p>During six articulation meetings (three face-to-face and three using a Webex platform) of the Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Reading Group (GDRG), all evidence was reviewed and clinical recommendations were developed. The strength level of clinical recommendations was based on the quality grade of the research and the potential benefits and harms of the procedure or therapy recommended. Where high-quality evidence to support a recommendation was weak or lacking, a group consensus was required to approve any consensus recommendations.</p>
<p>Clinical recommendations in this guideline are evidence-based statements regarding patient care that are supported by the scientific literature or consensus of professional opinion when no quality evidence was discovered.</p>
