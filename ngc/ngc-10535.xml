	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

The modules with accompanying recommendations are presented below. See the <a href=&quot;http://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/Rehab/UEAR/VADoDCPGManagementOfUEAR090214FINAL2508.pdf&quot; title=&quot;VA/DoD Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>original guideline document</a> for the algorithm and evidence tables associated with selected recommendations, including level and quality of evidence, strength of recommendation, and supporting evidence citations.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation rating (A, B, C, D, I, EO) is defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Core Module 1: The Care Team Approach</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Care Team Approach</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>An interdisciplinary amputation care team (care team) approach, including the patient, family and/or caregiver(s), is recommended in the management of all patients with upper extremity amputation. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Care Team Communication</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>Care teams should communicate on a regular basis to facilitate integration of a comprehensive treatment plan. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Core Module 2: Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Assessments</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>Comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments and reassessments should be conducted during each of the first three phases of care (perioperative, pre-prosthetic and prosthetic training). <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>The recommended components of the comprehensive assessment are summarized in Table 3 in the original guideline document. Additionally, a summary of assessments and interventions throughout all rehabilitation phases is found in Appendix B in the original guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Assessments</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>An annual comprehensive interdisciplinary assessment should be conducted for all patients with an upper extremity amputation throughout lifelong care. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>Appendix D in the original guideline document includes the essential elements of the annual assessment and this topic is addressed further in the lifelong care section of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Functional status measures should be utilized during assessments and reassessments throughout all phases of care to document outcomes and monitor the efficacy of rehabilitation. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>Various types of pain experienced after upper extremity loss should be managed appropriately and individually throughout all phases using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>Table 8 in the original guideline document lists the pharmacologic therapies to consider for post-amputation pain management. If pharmacologic therapy is offered, providers and patients should understand the uncertainties of the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of treatment, and require the patient to have regular follow-ups to reassess risks and benefits and modify treatment as indicated. These follow-ups could be done in-person or through the use of virtual and connected care.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>
    <li>The care team should provide appropriate education and educational resources to the patient, family and caregiver(s) throughout the phases of care. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Peer Support</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;11&quot;>

</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pre-prosthetic Phase</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pre-prosthetic Training</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;16&quot;>
    <li>The care team should ensure that patients undergo pre-prosthetic training to help determine the most appropriate type of device to achieve functional goals. <strong>[EO]</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>Education on the various types of available prostheses should be provided to the patient and his or her family and/or caregiver(s) by the care team prior to the initiation of a prosthetic prescription. See Appendix F: Advantages and Disadvantages of Prostheses in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Potential users of body-powered prostheses must be instructed in the various body motions that will be utilized to control opening and closing the terminal device and/or operating the elbow, including its locking mechanism, if applicable. See Appendix I: Control Strategies for Body-Powered and Externally Powered Prostheses in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Prosthesis Prescription</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;17&quot;>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Key Question Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Champions were tasked with identifying key evidence questions to guide the systematic review of the literature on rehabilitation management of upper extremity amputation. These questions, which were developed in consultation with Lewin and ECRI Institute, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations regarding upper extremity amputation rehabilitation (UEAR). The key questions follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 in the original guideline document provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology.</p>
<p>The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Table A-2 in the original guideline document&amp;nbsp;contains the final set of key questions used to guide the systematic review for the CPG.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>The methods guiding this systematic review are described below. In part, these methods follow the guidelines for conducting a systematic review set forth by the AHRQ in the <em>Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews</em>. The methods also follow the guidance set forth by the VA/DoD <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em> document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The systematic review of the literature consisted of several distinct steps, including:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Defining the inclusion and exclusion search criteria </li>
    <li>Developing a search strategy (i.e., search logic using MeSH [Medical Subject Headings] terminology and key words) </li>
    <li>Screening the results based on abstracts and titles (i.e., identifying relevant studies and excluding duplicate records) </li>
    <li>Reviewing the full text of remaining studies and abstracting relevant data points (i.e., population, comparator, results, etc.) </li>
    <li>Assessing the internal and external validity of abstracted studies </li>
    <li>Summarizing the evidence </li>
    <li>Interpreting the results </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Criteria for Study Inclusion/Exclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinical studies published on or after January 1, 2002, and systematic reviews published on or after January 1, 2007 </li>
    <li>All studies must be published in English </li>
    <li>Abstracts were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that were not full-length, clinical studies were not accepted as evidence </li>
    <li>All studies must have enrolled at least 1 upper extremity amputee </li>
    <li>All studies must have enrolled adults 18 years or older. In studies that mixed adults and children, at least 85 percent of the enrolled patients must have been 18 years or older </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Studies that enrolled only able-bodied participants </li>
    <li>Technical studies that did not include patients with an amputation or report on patient outcomes&amp;nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The search strategies listed in Tables A-3 and A-4 in the original guideline document were used to capture studies pertaining to all of the Key Questions for this report. Search sets were arranged into broad subject groups pertaining to amputation site, prosthesis design, treatment stage, activities of daily living, demographic variables, rehabilitation, and pain control, among other concepts. These search results were further refined to capture specific patient outcomes, study designs, publication types, and to exclude out-of-scope citations. The strategies are presented in OVID syntax and were used to search EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO. Similar strategies were used to search PubMed, CINAHL and ancillary databases.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Results of Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature search identified 3,140 citations potentially addressing the Key Questions of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 1,190 were excluded upon title review for not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, published prior to 2002). Overall, 1,227 abstracts were reviewed and 937 studies were excluded for the following reasons:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Non-systematic reviews or non-clinical trials </li>
    <li>Studies not addressing a Key Question of interest </li>
    <li>Technical studies that did not enroll patients with an amputation </li>
    <li>Studies published:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Prior to 2002 for clinical studies </li>
        <li>Prior to 2007 for systematic reviews </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A total of 290 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 183 were excluded during review for the following reasons:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Not a full-length systematic review or clinical study </li>
    <li>Not addressing a Key Question </li>
    <li>Not enrolling at least one patient with an upper extremity amputation </li>
    <li>Being a technical study with no relevant outcomes </li>
    <li>Duplicate studies </li>
</ul>
<p>A total of 107 full-length articles were thought to address one or more Key Questions and were further reviewed. Of these, 64 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A-1 in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>

<p>The evidence from each included study was abstracted into evidence tables and narratively synthesized. This guideline focuses primarily on the following patient-centered outcomes: independence in activities of daily living (ADL), prosthetic use, prosthetic satisfaction, satisfaction with body image and/or cosmesis, residual or phantom pain, quality of life, satisfaction with life, depression and other mood disorders, incidence of complications, reintegration, and return to work. The strength of the evidence was assessed along the following criteria: methodological quality, consistency of findings across studies, directness of the evidence (e.g., head-to-head comparisons provide the most direct evidence), and precision (i.e., the degree of certainty around an outcome's effect size).</p>
<p>Overall, the evidence base for this guideline consisted of 43 studies. The majority of the evidence addressed strategies to treat postoperative phantom and residual limb pain. A fair amount of evidence considered factors associated with successful, long-term prosthetic use at one or more years following rehabilitation. Very few studies considered rehabilitation at the pre-prosthetic or prosthetic training phase. Inconsistencies of the evidence are discussed in the text describing the basis of a recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Assessment</strong></p>
<p>In order for the clinician to be aware of the evidence base behind the recommendations and the weight that should be given to each recommendation, the recommendations are keyed according to the level of confidence with which each recommendation is made. The graded recommendations are based on two main dimensions: 1) net benefit of an intervention and 2) certainty of evidence associated with that net benefit. When evidence is limited, the level of confidence also incorporates clinical consensus with regard to a particular clinical decision.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The methodology used in developing this 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) follows the <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal document of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development of a upper extremity amputation rehabilitation (UEAR) CPG.</p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Specifically, the Champions for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management of patients with upper extremity amputations. In addition, the Champions assisted in:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review </li>
    <li>Assessing the level and quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes </li>
</ol>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, US Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified five clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 CPG.</p>
<p>The Lewin Team (team), including Duty First Consulting and ECRI Institute, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The team held the first conference call in October 2012, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review about the management of UEAR. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of UEAR, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: Internal Medicine, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physiatry, Physical Medicine &amp;amp; Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy, Prosthetics, Psychology, Recreational Therapy, Social Work and Surgery.</p>
<p>The guideline development process for the 2014 CPG update consisted of the following steps:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Formulating evidence questions (Key Questions) </li>
    <li>Conducting the systematic review </li>
    <li>Convening a face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting and submitting a final CPG about the management of UEAR to the VA/DoD EBPWG </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations presented in this CPG are based on a systematic appraisal of the published evidence on the rehabilitation and management of Veterans and Service Members with acquired upper extremity amputation. In areas where the evidence is particularly lacking, expert opinion served as the basis for the recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>In order for the clinician to be aware of the evidence base behind the recommendations and the weight that should be given to each recommendation, the recommendations are keyed according to the level of confidence with which each recommendation is made. The graded recommendations are based on two main dimensions: 1) net benefit of an intervention and 2) certainty of evidence associated with that net benefit. When evidence is limited, the level of confidence also incorporates clinical consensus with regard to a particular clinical decision.</p>

<p>To grade the recommendations for the guideline, the CPG Working Group used a variation of the USPSTF grading framework to provide for a grade of EO for &quot;Expert Opinion.&quot; Given that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have to be used in real practice for Veterans and Service Members, a grade of I for insufficient evidence may not provide useful guidance for supporting clinical decisions in practice. In particular, the guideline developers considered certain instances in which evidence suggests a Substantial or Moderate net benefit, but the certainty/strength of that evidence is Low. In those instances, rather than concluding that the evidence is insufficient to support a clinical decision, the guideline developers relied on expert opinion to set forth a recommendation. A grade of EO does not imply that the evidence is strong (it is still Low). However, it does suggest that the magnitude of net benefit (Substantial or Moderate) is of sufficient clinical importance to make a recommendation, even if it is based on low certainty (weak evidence).</p>
<p>This CPG represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and clinical practice on the management of upper limb amputation rehabilitation. It attempts to be as free as possible of bias toward any theoretical or empirical approach to treatment.</p>
<p>This CPG is the product of many months of diligent effort and consensus building among knowledgeable individuals from the VHA and the DoD. An experienced moderator facilitated the multidisciplinary Working Group. An experienced moderator facilitated the multidisciplinary Working Group. The draft document was discussed in a face-to-face group meeting. The content and validity of each section was thoroughly reviewed in a series of conference calls.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Engagement</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations included in this guideline are patient-centric. In an effort to ensure that the patient is at the core of any clinical decision, the Work Group identified a group of individuals from within the VA and DoD with upper limb amputations. Approximately 10 patients, currently receiving care from the VA and/or DoD health systems, were invited to join the Work Group for a discussion on their experiences. These individuals represented different age groups, sexes, race/ethnicities, and had various causes of upper limb loss. The group consisted of non-combat veterans who underwent elective and non-elective upper limb amputations as well as combat veterans from Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.</p>
<p>The Work Group developed a set of concise, thought-provoking questions in an effort to gather insights on each person's care and rehabilitation experience. These questions included:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>How critical do you feel your care team was to your rehabilitation? </li>
    <li>How were options for treatment presented to you throughout your care? </li>
    <li>To what extent did you feel empowered to make treatment decisions? </li>
    <li>Throughout each phase of your care, how often did you have contact with any member of your care team? </li>
    <li>How could your care and rehabilitation process have been improved? </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Work Group reviewed each practice recommendation with the participants in order to identify and address any potential gaps within the CPG. The discussion that ensued was fairly informal and designed to gather information about the patient's experience with their primary care providers and care team throughout their rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Several key insights were gleaned from this discussion and subsequently used to refine and clarify the guideline recommendations. In particular, participants noted that an interdisciplinary care team approach, shared decision making, and education on emerging prosthetic technologies are critical to improving the patient experience during and following rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Several participants indicated that while they have been generally satisfied with their primary care providers, rehabilitation providers, or prosthetists, a truly comprehensive care team approach was essential but occasionally missing, in which all or most members of the team are fully abreast of the patient's progress and engaged in all aspects of his or her care. The Work Group used this information to further emphasize the importance of the care team and outlined the various individuals that should be involved, including the patient's family and/or caregivers.</p>
<p>Participants also described the importance of utilizing a shared decision making model, which allows providers and patients to identify rehabilitations goals, assess prosthetic needs, and make treatment decisions together. Some of the older participants explained that historically, very little was discussed in terms of goal setting between themselves and their providers. Often, rehabilitation and training, both with and without prosthesis, was primarily achieved through trial and error over time, rather than during the rehabilitation process. Today, shared decision making is more frequently used in a clinical setting, particularly due to VA and DoD commitment to providing patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Finally, participants expressed concern over a lack of communication between patients and providers regarding education and information on emerging prosthetic technologies. Several individuals noted that most of the information they receive comes from indirect sources (i.e., other people with amputations), rather than from their providers. The Work Group incorporated this feedback into the lifelong care phase.</p>
<p>Participants for this discussion were identified and recruited by the CPG Work Group. Participants received modest compensation for their travel. The Work Group noted the value in incorporating patients during the development of this guideline and suggested that other CPG Work Groups follow this model.</p></div>"/>
