	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>A. Diagnostic Approach</strong></span></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>For patients with low back pain, the Work Group recommends that clinicians conduct a history and physical examination, that should include identifying and evaluating neurologic deficits (e.g., radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication), red flag symptoms associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection), and psychosocial factors. (<strong>Strong For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with low back pain, the Work Group suggests performing a mental health screening as part of the low back pain evaluation and taking results into consideration during selection of treatment. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>

    <li>For patients with low back pain, the Work Group recommends diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are serious or progressive or when red flag symptoms are present. (<strong>Strong For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with low back pain greater than one month who have not improved or responded to initial treatments, there is inconclusive evidence to recommend for or against any diagnostic imaging. (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, New-added</strong>) </li>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>B. Education and Self-care</strong></span></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>For patients with chronic low back pain, the Work Group recommends providing evidence-based information with regard to their expected course, advising patients to remain active, and providing information about self-care options. (<strong>Strong For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with chronic low back pain, the Work Group suggests adding a structured education component, including pain neurophysiology, as part of a multicomponent self-management intervention. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-added</strong>) </li>

    <li>For patients with chronic low back pain, the Work Group suggests mindfulness-based stress reduction. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with acute low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of specific clinician-directed exercise. (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with chronic low back pain, the Work Group suggests offering clinician-directed exercises. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>

    <li>For patients with acute low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture. (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with chronic low back pain, the Work Group suggests offering acupuncture. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>For acute or chronic low back pain, there is insufficient evidence for or against the use of lumbar supports. (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with chronic low back pain, the Work Group suggests offering an exercise program, which may include Pilates, yoga, and tai chi. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound. (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, New-added</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with low back pain, there is inconclusive evidence to support the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, New-added</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of lumbar traction. (<strong>Not Applicable; Reviewed, New-added</strong>) </li>

</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, &quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;Weak.&quot; A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. </p>
<p>Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>No recommendation for or against</strong> (or &quot;There is insufficient evidence &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests not offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends against offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed &quot;Conditional,&quot; &quot;Discretionary,&quot; or &quot;Qualified.&quot; Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Categories and Definitions</strong></p>
<p>For use in the 2017 lower back pain (LBD) clinical practice guideline (CPG), a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2007 LBD CPG.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Developing the Scope and Key Questions</strong></span></p>
<p>The clinical practice guideline (CPG) Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying key questions (KQs) to guide the systematic evidence review of the literature on low back pain (LBP). These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin Team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations. The KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 in the original guideline document provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. </p>
<p>The Champions, Work Group, and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs were not able to be included in the systematic review (SR). Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, and those were included in the review. Table A-4 in the original guideline document contains the final set of KQs used to guide the SR for this CPG.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Conducting the Systematic Review</strong></span></p>
<p>Extensive literature searches using the search terms and strategy included in Appendix H identified 5,691 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 2,118 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, not a full-length article). Overall, 3,573 abstracts were reviewed with 2,846 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not an SR or clinical study, did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not enroll a population of interest, or published prior to December 1, 2006. A total of 727 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 609 were excluded after a full article review for the following: wrong study design or not addressing a KQ of interest, wrong study population or not reporting chronic pain patients separately, SR superseded by more comprehensive review or relevant studies included in report, no outcomes of interest, or other (e.g., being a duplicate). Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A-1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Study Inclusion/Exclusion </strong></p>
<p><em>General Criteria </em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinical studies or SRs published on or after December 1, 2006 to October 21, 2016. If multiple SRs addressed a key question, the most recent and/or comprehensive review was selected. SRs were supplemented with clinical studies published subsequent to the search dates of the SR. </li>
    <li>Studies must have been published in English. </li>
    <li>Publication must have been a full clinical study or SR; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that were not full-length clinical studies were not accepted as evidence. </li>
    <li>Studies of diagnostic tests must have provided data on at least 50 patients. Studies of treatments must have reported outcome data on at least 50 patients (and at least 25 per study group) unless otherwise noted (see Key Question Specific Criteria below). </li>
    <li>Study must have reported an outcome of interest. </li>
    <li>Study must have enrolled a patient population in which at least 80% of patients had LBP and were age 18 years or older. If the percentage was less than 80%, then data must have been reported separately for this patient subgroup. Study must have reported in its abstract that patients had LBP. For studies of treatments, patients must not have had spondylolisthesis, postoperative LBP, or pregnancy-related LBP. </li>
</ul>
<p>For each treatment or diagnostic test of each KQ, it was first determined whether any SRs addressed the question. If so, only the most comprehensive SR was included. Studies published after the SR's last search date were also considered. If there was not an SR that addressed the KQ, studies from December 2006 onward that met all the inclusion criteria for that KQ were included. </p>
<p><em>Key Question Specific Criteria </em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For studies of accuracy (KQ1a), studies/reviews must have reported both sensitivity and specificity (or sufficient information to calculate both values), and must have used a reference standard that was independent of the index test. </li>
    <li>For studies of clinical utility (KQ1b), studies/reviews must have compared two groups of patients: one that received the diagnostic test of interest, and one that did not, in order to measure the influence of the test on treatment choice and/or patient outcomes. </li>
    <li>For KQs 2 through 8, reviews must have been SRs directly addressing a KQ, and studies must have randomly assigned patients to different treatments (the comparator could have been a placebo treatment). The minimum follow-up was 12 weeks for effectiveness outcomes, and there was no minimum follow-up for harms outcomes. Harms data were extracted from any studies reporting effectiveness data beyond 12 weeks follow-up. </li>
    <li>For KQ 9, studies/reviews did not have to be randomized, but did have to compare the post-treatment outcomes of patients who had a psychosocial risk factor to the post-treatment outcomes of patients who did not have that psychosocial risk factor but were otherwise similar. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Abstracting and Managing Data</strong></span></p>
<p>For each study included in the review, the following study level details were abstracted: country, purpose, and quality rating. For previous systematic reviews, the search strategy used, study selection criteria, and overall information about the evidence base, including number of included studies and overall patients enrolled were reported. For all studies, the reviewers abstracted data about characteristics of the included patients and interventions being assessed. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessing Individual Studies' Methodological Quality (i.e., Internal Validity or Risk of Bias)</strong></span></p>
<p>As per the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) <em>Guidelines for Guidelines</em> document, risk-of-bias (or study quality) of individual studies and previous systematic reviews was assessed using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) method. Each study was assigned a rating of Good, Fair, or Poor based on sets of criteria that vary depending on study design. Detailed lists of criteria and definitions of Good, Fair, or Poor ratings for different study designs appear in Appendix VII of the <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/methods-and-processes&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>USPSTF procedure manual</a>. </p>
<p>Because the USPSTF does not have criteria specific for evaluation of prognostic studies, the reviewers rated the quality of prognostic studies using the recently-developed Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. This instrument assesses potential bias related to six domains: study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Data Synthesis</strong></span></p>
<p>The evidence review team used a narrative approach to synthesizing the evidence for all the Key Questions. As indicated in the VA/DoD <em>Guidelines for Guidelines</em> document, the first line of evidence was previous systematic reviews. For questions in which a previous review was available, individual studies that met this review's inclusion criteria were used to supplement or update the previous review. The reviewers considered whether subsequent evidence supports the conclusions reported in the previous review. For questions for which no previous review was available, they summarized the overall findings for the outcomes of interest of the studies that addressed a key question. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessing the Overall Quality of the Body of Evidence for an Outcome</strong></span></p>
<p>The overall quality of the body of evidence supporting the findings for the outcomes of interest in this report was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The GRADE system primarily involves consideration of the following factors: overall study quality (or overall risk of bias or study limitations), consistency of evidence, directness of evidence, and precision of evidence. Given time and resources, other factors such as publication bias may also be considered. For more information on the GRADE system go to the GRADE Working Group Web site at the following link: <a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Working Group Web site&quot;>http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The GRADE system rates the overall quality of the evidence as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). For instance, a body of evidence that consists of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) automatically starts with a rating of high quality. This rating can be downgraded if some of the RCTs have serious flaws such as lack of blinding of outcome assessors, not reporting concealment of allocation, or high dropout rate. Similarly, the quality can be downgraded or further downgraded if inconsistencies of findings are present or if there is a lack of precision surrounding an outcome's effect size.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessing Applicability</strong></span> </p>
<p>When describing the evidence base addressing a Key Question, the reviewers discussed aspects of the included studies, such as characteristics of included patients and treatments being assessed that may make the overall findings of the studies more or less applicable to the population, treatments, or outcomes of interest to this review. </p></div>"/>

<p>The current document is an update to the 2007 <em>Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Low Back Pain (LBP) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG)</em>. The methodology used in developing the 2017 LBP CPG follows the VA/DoD <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal document of the VA and DoD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG). The VA/DoD <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em> can be downloaded from <a href=&quot;http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp&quot; title=&quot;Department of Veterans Affairs Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp</a> (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development and submission of an updated LBP CPG. The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified four clinical leaders from the VA and the DoD as Champions for the 2017 LBP CPG. </p>
<p>The Champions and the Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA and DoD healthcare systems. Specifically, the Champions and the Work Group were responsible for identifying the Key Questions (KQs) &amp;ndash; those considered most clinically relevant, important, and interesting with respect to the diagnosis and management of patients with LBP. The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The amount of new scientific evidence that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes </li>
</ul>
<p>The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in June 2016, with participation from the contracting officer's representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, participants discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base an SR about the diagnosis and treatment of LBP. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that were important and relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of LBP, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: chiropractic care, integrative medicine, neurology, nursing, pain medicine, pharmacy, physical medicine and rehabilitation, physical therapy, primary care, radiology, and surgery.</p>
<p>The guideline development process for the 2017 LBP CPG update consisted of the following steps: </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Formulating and prioritizing evidence questions (KQs) </li>
    <li>Conducting the systematic review of the literature </li>
    <li>Convening a face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting, revising, and submitting a final CPG about the diagnosis and treatment of LBP to the VA/DoD EBPWG </li>
</ol>
<p>Appendix A in the original guideline document provides a detailed description of each of these tasks. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Convening the Face-to-face Meeting</strong></span></p>
<p>In consultation with the COR, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and a half day face-to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on December 6-9, 2016. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2007 LBP CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review of KQs 1-9 in order to facilitate and inform the process. </p>
<p>Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the 2007 LBP CPG, modifying the recommendations as necessary. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not presented in the 2007 LBP CPG, based on the 2016 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into three smaller subgroups at this meeting. </p>
<p>As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation. </p>
<p>In addition to developing recommendations during the face-to-face meeting, the Work Group members also revised the 2007 LBP CPG algorithm to reflect the new and amended recommendations. They discussed the available evidence as well as changes in clinical practice since 2007, as necessary, to update the algorithm. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Grading Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes </li>
    <li>Confidence in the quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Patient or provider values and preferences </li>
    <li>Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.: 
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Resource use </li>
        <li>Equity </li>
        <li>Acceptability </li>
        <li>Feasibility </li>
        <li>Subgroup considerations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The framework in Table A-6 in the original guideline document (&quot;Evidence to Recommendations Framework&quot;) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain. </p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework, which combines the four domains. GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low. In these types of instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation. </p>
<p>The GRADE of a recommendation is based on the following elements: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above) </li>
    <li>Relative strength (Strong or Weak) </li>
    <li>Direction (For or Against) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Reconciling 2007 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence-based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on new evidence or as scheduled, subject to time-based expirations. For example, the USPSTF has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations pertaining to preventive services. Further, the inclusion criteria for the National Guideline Clearinghouse specify that a guideline must have been developed, reviewed, or revised within the past five years. </p>
<p>The 2017 LBP CPG is an update of the 2007 LBP CPG. Thus, the content of the 2017 LBP CPG is reflective of the previous version of the CPG, but modified where necessary to reflect new evidence and new clinical priorities. </p>
<p>The Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Work Group considered the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the previous 2007 LBP CPG without complete review of the relevant evidence, subject to evolving practice in today's environment. </p>
<p>To indicate which recommendations were developed based on the updated review of the evidence versus recommendations that were carried forward from the 2007 version of the CPG, a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which older recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the categories took into account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation was systematically reviewed, the degree to which the recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current patient care environment and within the scope of the CPG. Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in the &quot;Recommendation Categorization&quot; section in the original guideline document. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2017 version of the guideline can be found in the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field. The categorizations for each 2007 LBP CPG recommendation can be found in Appendix E in the original guideline document. </p>
<p>In cases where a 2007 LBP CPG recommendation was covered by a 2017 KQ, peer-reviewed literature published since the 2007 LBP CPG was considered along with the evidence base used for the 2007 LBPCPG. Where new literature was considered when assessing the strength of the recommendation, it is referenced in the discussion following the corresponding recommendation, as well as in Appendix C in the original guideline document. </p>
<p>The CPG Work Group recognizes that, while there are practical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous SR, previous recommendations, or recent peer-reviewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive SR and, therefore, may introduce bias.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>Following the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discussion sections from the 2007 LBP CPG to support the amended &quot;carried forward&quot; recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2007 LBP CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made additional revisions to the algorithm, as necessary.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="146" ordby="550" id="415" name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, &quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;Weak.&quot; A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. </p>
<p>Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>No recommendation for or against</strong> (or &quot;There is insufficient evidence &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests not offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends against offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed &quot;Conditional,&quot; &quot;Discretionary,&quot; or &quot;Qualified.&quot; Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Categories and Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>For use in the 2017 Lower Back Pain (LBD) clinical practice guideline (CPG), a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2007 LBD CPG.</p>

Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. </li>
    <li>These guidelines are not intended to represent Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits may be found at <a href=&quot;http://www.tricare.mil&quot; title=&quot;TRICARE Web site&quot;>www.tricare.mil</a> or by contacting your regional TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor. </li>
    <li>As with other CPGs, there are limitations, including significant evidence gaps, and a need to develop effective strategies for guideline implementation and evaluation of the effect of guideline adherence on clinical outcomes. Thus, as stated above, this CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns evolve. This CPG is based on evidence available through October 2016 and is intended to provide a general guide to best practices. The guideline can assist healthcare providers, but the use of a CPG must always be considered as a recommendation, within the context of a provider's clinical judgment and patient values and preferences, for the care of an individual patient. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This clinical practice guideline (CPG) and algorithm are designed to be adapted by healthcare providers for the treatment of individual patients, bearing in mind patient-level considerations as well as local needs and resources. The algorithm serves as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of care.
</p>
<p>Although this CPG represents the recommended practice on the date of its publication, medical practice is evolving and this evolution requires continuous updating based on published information. New technology and more research will improve patient care in the future. Identifying areas where evidence was lacking for the 2017 CPG can help identify priority areas for future research. Future studies examining the results of low back pain (LBP) CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly relevant to clinical practice.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></span></p>
<p>At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (COI) in the past 24 months. Verbal affirmations of no COI were also used as necessary during meetings throughout the guideline development process. The project team was also subject to random web-based surveillance (e.g., ProPublica, Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services [CMS] Open Payments). </p>
<p>If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), then it was reported to the Office of Evidence Based Practice. It was also discussed with the low Back Pain (LBP) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) Work Group in tandem with their review of the evidence and development of recommendations. The Office of Evidence Based Practice and the LBP CPG Work Group determined whether or not action, such as restricting participation and/or voting on sections related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If it was deemed necessary, action to mitigate the COI was taken by the Champions and Office of Evidence Based Practice, based on the level and extent of involvement. No conflicts of interest were identified for the LBP CPG Work Group members or Champions. Disclosure forms are on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Based Practice Program office and available upon request.</p></div>"/>
