	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Apolipoprotein (Apo) B</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Medicine Best Practice (LMBP) Working Group (WG) Recommendation (Apo B)</strong></p>
<p>Based on the moderate evidence of effectiveness, lipoprotein apo B measure is recommended to improve the risk prediction for cardiovascular events when added to other traditional risk factors for the populations at risk (e.g., men &amp;gt;35 years, women &amp;gt;45 years, and younger adults &amp;ge;20 years old with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease [CVD], in ambulatory and inpatient settings). This recommendation is based on consistently favorable results from 3 good quality and 1 fair quality studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Apo A-I </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>LMBP WG Recommendation (Apo A-I)</strong></p>
<p>Because of the insufficient available evidence, no recommendations could be made for or against the effectiveness of apo A-I practices to predict the CVD events.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Apo B/Apo A-I</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>LMBP WG Recommendation (Apo B/Apo A-I Ratio)</strong></p>
<p>According to the LMBP methods, based on the moderate evidence of effectiveness the lipoprotein apo B/apo A-I ratio is recommended to improve the risk prediction for cardiovascular events when added to other traditional risk factors for the populations at risk (e.g., men &amp;gt;35 years, women &amp;gt;45 years, younger adults &amp;ge;20 years old with multiple risk factors for CVD, in ambulatory and inpatient settings). This recommendation is developed based on evidence from 4 good and 3 fair quality studies (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (Non-HDL-C)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>LMBP WG Recommendation (Non-HDL-C)</strong></p>
<p>Because of the insufficient available evidence, no recommendations could be made for or against the effectiveness of non-HDL-C practices to predict the CVD events (see Table 3 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall Strength of Evidence Ratings*</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: Adequate volume of consistent evidence of substantial healthcare quality impact from studies without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Some evidence of consistent substantial healthcare quality impact from studies without major limitations; OR an adequate volume of consistent evidence of moderate healthcare quality impact from studies without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: Limited evidence of moderate healthcare quality impact from a small number of studies without major limitations; OR the quality of some studies' design and/or conduct is limited.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient</strong>: Any estimate of an effect on healthcare quality impact is too uncertain.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*These rating categories have their basis in the work of Guyatt et al.; they were modified to reflect both the quality of the evidence and effect size observed, rather than attempting to anticipate the impact of future potential evidence. The modified definitions for these categories are modeled after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Categories</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommend</strong>: High or moderate for improving healthcare quality. The practice should be identified as a &quot;best practice&quot; for implementation in appropriate care settings, taking into account variations and applicability in implementation and/or care settings.</p>
<p><strong>No recommendation for or against</strong>: Suggestive or insufficient. A potentially favorable impact on healthcare quality is not of sufficient size, or not sufficiently supported by evidence to indicate that it should be identified as a &quot;best practice&quot; for implementation in appropriate care settings.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend against</strong>: High or moderate for adversely affecting healthcare quality. The practice should not be identified as a &quot;best practice&quot; for implementation because it is not likely to result in more good than harm.</p></div>"/>

<p>What practices are effective at improving the risk prediction (or risk estimation) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among the populations at risk, specifically ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, and CVD death, when supplemented to the traditional lipid (e.g., total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides [TG], and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and nonlipid (e.g., age, sex, smoking status, and blood pressure) risk factors? This review question is addressed in the context of an analytic framework as depicted in Figure 1 in the original guideline document. The following were the relevant Population, Intervention/Practice, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) elements considered for this review.</p>
<p><strong>Population</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Men (&amp;gt;35 years) </li>
    <li>Women (&amp;gt;45 years) </li>
    <li>Younger adults (&amp;ge;20 years) with multiple cardiovascular risk factors for CVD </li>
    <li>No previously diagnosed CVD or diabetes at baseline </li>
    <li>In ambulatory (including primary, specialty care) and inpatient settings </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Practices using nonstandard lipoprotein measurements in addition to the existing traditional risk factors (e.g., TC, TG, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], age, sex, smoking status, and blood pressure) for calculating cardiovascular risk assessment. The following lipid biomarkers were considered for this review:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Apolipoprotein (apo B) </li>
    <li>Apo A-I </li>
    <li>Apo B/apo </li>
    <li>A-I ratio </li>
    <li>Non-HDL-C </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparison</strong></p>
<p>Practices using traditional risk factors (e.g., TC and HDL-C, age, sex, smoking status, and blood pressure) alone to calculate CVD risk prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Improvement in the 10-year risk prediction of CVD events (e.g., myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and CVD death) upon adding the nonstandard biomarker. Studies with follow-up period &amp;lt;10 years were still included in the review but were penalized in the study quality rating because of type 1 censoring of the findings.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Studies to Be Included in This Review </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>To meet the eligibility criteria for this review, a study had to (a) address one or more of the proposed practices of interest in the context of CVD outcomes; (b) target populations in the studies who met the population criteria&amp;mdash;that is, at-risk populations described above, with no previously diagnosed CVD or diabetes; (c) report the outcome(s) of interest&amp;mdash;that is, improvement in the 10-year risk prediction of CVD events (e.g., myocardial infarction, CVD death) due to the addition of 1 of the 4 practices; and (d) provide comparison data to calculate the effectiveness of practices of interest (e.g., pre- and post-intervention data, concurrent comparison data).</p>
<p>In addition, interventions were considered to be included in this review if the biomarker of interest was added to a model or algorithm of the traditional lipid profile (e.g., TC, TG, HDL-C) and other risk factor (e.g., high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, family history of premature heart disease, age, sex, diet, obesity, and physical inactivity) for predicting CVD risk. The practices were considered individually (e.g., the combination of apo B and non-HDL-C simultaneously added into a model was not considered a practice of interest), unless the results for the effectiveness of each practice was reported separately. A practice was considered effective if the fit of a model containing all traditional risk factors was significantly improved through the addition of a practice.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) previously diagnosed CVD or symptomatic coronary artery disease at baseline and (b) previously diagnosed diabetes at baseline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Acquire (A-2): Search for Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted to retrieve the relevant evidence published before and including July 2015. Three databases were used for a formal literature search: PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE (focusing on international biomedical literature). Details of the formal literature search strategy can be found in Supplemental Appendix C (see the online Data Supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). In addition, the systematic review team used other sources to locate relevant studies including hand searches (e.g., the citations from retrieved studies, Google scholar) and referrals from the experts in the field (e.g., expert panel team). To collect relevant unpublished data, researchers in the field, laboratories, and institutions were invited through personal requests and the Laboratory Medicine Best Practices (LMBP) website, but the review team did not receive any relevant unpublished data to be included in this review.</p></div>"/>

<p>During the initial screening process, studies were excluded if they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria for this review as described. Each eligible study was abstracted and assessed for quality of execution by 2 independent reviewers. Data abstraction was conducted by using the standardized Laboratory Medicine Best Practices (LMBP) abstraction methods and abstraction form. All differences were resolved through consensus. After the full abstraction, each study was evaluated for quality scoring to minimize any issue related to internal and external validity using LMBP quality assessment methods (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Details on the rating process of individual studies can be found elsewhere (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Each study was classified into 1 of 3 quality ratings: good (8&amp;ndash;10 score), fair (5&amp;ndash;7 score), and poor (&amp;le;4 score). Studies with poor quality ratings were excluded from the effect size metaanalyses and the overall practice evidence base. See Supplemental Appendix D (in the online Data Supplement; see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for the Evidence Summary Tables containing quality ratings for each study.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Analyze (A-4): Summarization of Results and Strength of the Effect Magnitude</span></strong></p>
<p>Results from all included studies were variously reported risk ratios: odds ratios, relative risks, or hazard ratios. For the analyses purposes, these ratios were assumed to approximate the same measure of relative risk. Metaanalysis was performed to calculate the overall grand mean effect. A random-effects model was used for these statistics to perform metaanalysis because (a) not all the studies compared the same mixture of nontraditional lipid biomarkers to the traditional risk factors to improve the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction and (b) the long-term CVD risk prediction was based on different clinical CVD events in individual studies. To evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions, pooled point estimates across studies were expressed as an overall grand mean with confident intervals (CIs). When possible, all metaanalysis results were presented as forest plots, where the vertical line labeled &quot;1&quot; equals &quot;no/minimal&quot; difference between practices, and estimates to the right of the line favor the tested practice, i.e., improved risk prediction of CVD events due to the assessed practice. However, as apolipoprotein (apo) A-I levels inversely correlate with risk for CVD (i.e., high apo A-I levels are protective against future cardiovascular events), the effect estimates less than 1 were considered favorable for development of CVD risk prediction.</p>
<p>For the effectiveness strength rating, the point estimate from each study between &amp;le;1 and &amp;le;2.0 was considered as a &quot;moderate&quot; magnitude of effectiveness; and any point estimate &amp;gt;2.0 was considered a &quot;substantial&quot; magnitude of effect. Final conclusions and recommendations for the overall effectiveness were based on the criteria including number of studies, quality of available evidence, consistency of results, and magnitude of effect estimates. Criteria for these ratings are described in greater detail elsewhere (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p>The scope and clinical relevance of this review is confined to cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and excludes stroke, which has been included in the outcome for CVD risk assessment in the recent national guidelines for assessment of cardiovascular risk. Most of the evidence for this review is from prospective studies with populations having a single race/ethnicity, thus limiting generalizability. However, across the studies, there was a variety of findings supporting the need to develop population-specific risk prediction systems. In some cases, the follow-up period was &amp;lt;10 years, which may introduce bias into the case ascertainment process. However, this concern was compensated during the quality scoring of these studies. Differences in inherent or baseline risk status may arise from the type of population used in the studies (community based vs clinic based), which may affect study results. In addition, the restriction to English language studies may also introduce bias.</p>
<p>Several studies summarized in this review did not control for variations in measurement method and interindividual variation&amp;mdash;for example, this review assumed that all biomarker tests used in individual studies performed at the same level of analytical quality. The impact of these differences on the outcome of this review is not known.</p>

<p>Apolipoprotein (apo) B is measured mainly by immunonephelometric or immunoturbidimetric assays. Efforts to improve variability among these assays have been made by harmonizing measurements using a thoroughly characterized immunoassay. Because apo B is a well-characterized analyte, it has the potential of being standardized and linked to the International System of Units (SI system), which is not possible with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which is often only indirectly measured and harmonized to a thoroughly characterized ultracentrifugation method. Like apo B, apo A-I is mainly measured with immunonephelometric or immunoturbidimetric assays. These assays are being harmonized to a thoroughly characterized immunoassay, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) assays are standardized to a thoroughly characterized ultracentrifugation method. Non-HDL-C is simply calculated as the difference between total plasma cholesterol and HDL-C. Since it can be calculated directly from routine lipid tests, it does not incur additional cost, making it more readily available. Since non-HDL-C does not depend on triglycerides, it can be calculated from nonfasting samples.</p></div>"/>
