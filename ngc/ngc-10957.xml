<p>The Expert Panel developed its recommendations based on evidence identified through online searches of Medline and the Cochrane Library (from January 2006 through August 2015, to overlap with the search end date for the 2007 guideline update on tumor markers in breast cancer [Harris et al., 2007]), and their own clinical experience. See Data Supplement 4 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for full details on the search string. A combined PubMed search was conducted for this guideline and for a similar guideline on use of biomarkers to guide decisions on systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with articles selected for each guideline's systematic review based on the patient population studied. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Population: Women with early stage invasive breast cancer being considered for adjuvant systemic therapy, with separate sub-questions and analyses on patient groups with:

        <li>Hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease </li>
        <li>HER2-positive disease </li>
        <li>Triple receptor negative disease (estrogen receptor-negative [ER-negative], progesterone receptor-negative [PR-negative], and HER2-negative) </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Publications in English were included if they reported rigorously conducted systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective biomarker analyses of samples from completed prospective RCTs, or prospective observational studies that directly compared outcomes of treatment decisions made on the basis of assay results with outcomes of treatment decisions made regardless of assay results. </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews; (3) published in a non-English language; (4) retrospective observational studies.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, community oncology, statistician, and health outcome researchers, the Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting and three webinars. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel. The Expert Panel members are listed in Appendix Table A1 of the original guideline document. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (JCO) for peer review and publication. All ASCO guidelines are reviewed and approved by the ASCO CPGC prior to publication.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz&amp;trade; software. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality, to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

Benefits may include improvement in survival end points such as event-free survival, disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival, or overall survival (OS). A new biomarker test must be shown to contribute clinically useful information beyond that already provided by clinical or pathologic indicators in standard use, unless the new test can provide equivalent information at lower cost, less invasively, or with less inconvenience or risk. The magnitude of the benefit must be clinically meaningful and outweigh risks, costs, and/or inconvenience associated with use of the test.

<p>When the panel considered each of the tumor biomarker assay tests, the use context, analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility were considered. For the use context of estimating prognosis to consider whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be administered, the panel recommended use of a tumor biomarker assay if high levels of evidence suggest that it identifies a group of patients for whom the absolute benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could not exceed 2% to 3%, which is roughly equal to the risk of fatal, life-threatening, or permanently changing toxicities. For other use contexts, the panel's considerations are noted in the appropriate section of the original guideline document. </p></div>"/>
