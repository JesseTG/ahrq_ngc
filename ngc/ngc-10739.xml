	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Structured Web site Search</strong></p>
<p>A member of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines. </p>
<p>Guidelines were selected based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Self-identified as a &quot;guideline&quot; &amp;ndash; in title or body of article </li>
    <li>Published in English; national and international in scope </li>
    <li>Developed between the years of 2005 - 2014 </li>
    <li>Strictly on the topic areas listed in search terms </li>
    <li>Available and accessible for retrieval </li>
</ul>
<p>See the search strategy document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for a list of Web sites searched.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong></p>
<p>RNAO Expert Panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify and submit potentially relevant guidelines. Guidelines submitted for consideration by panel members were integrated into the retrieved list of guidelines if they had not been identified by the on-line guideline search and met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a systematic review for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted by a health sciences librarian. </p>
<p><strong>Guideline Review</strong></p>
<p>The RNAO guideline development team searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between 2005 and 2014. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites, recommendations from the literature, and key Web sites related to substance use disorder. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria, is available online at <a href=&quot;http://www.RNAO.ca&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>www.RNAO.ca</a>. Guidelines were also identified by members of the RNAO expert panel. </p>
<p>Members of the expert panel critically appraised 14 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em>. From this review, five guidelines were selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by the RNAO guideline development team in collaboration with the RNAO research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles published in English, between 2005 and 2014, was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA). In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies. </p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available online at <a href=&quot;http://rnao.ca/substanceuse&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>http://rnao.ca/substanceuse</a>. </p></div>"/>

<p>Members of the expert panel critically appraised 14 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em>. From this review, five guidelines were selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, the records were divided equally between two teams of research associates (RA), comprised of two RAs each (three RAs are nurses holding masters degrees; one RA is an epidemiologist holding a masters degree). Each member of the team independently assessed the eligibility of their studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) Best Practice Guideline program manager, who was involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel, resolved disagreements between RAs within each team. </p>
<p>Quality appraisal scores for 24 articles (a random sample of 10% of articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by each RA. Acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, &amp;kappa;=0.71) justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction by dividing the remaining studies equally between the RAs. A final summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all RNAO expert panel members for review and discussion. </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>For this new guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence, which captured relevant literature published between 2005 and 2014, was based on the purpose and scope of this guideline and supported by the following three questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>What are the most effective methods of assessment for substance use disorders for individuals aged 11 years and older? </li>
    <li>What are the most effective interventions for individuals aged 11 years and older with a substance use disorder? </li>
    <li>What education and policy considerations may best facilitate nurses' care of individuals with a substance use disorder? </li>
</ol>
<p>The RNAO expert panel's mandate was to develop an evidence-based Best Practice Guideline that will provide nurses and other health-care providers with current best practices for engaging clients who use substances. The recommendations in this Guideline aim to bridge the identified gap between current practice and evidence-based practice. </p>

    <li>Administering standardized screening instruments in a variety of practice settings (e.g., emergency departments, primary health-care settings, acute care settings, long-term care) has been shown to reduce substance use among clients; improve access to early interventions, thereby decreasing harms to clients' health and leading to positive client outcomes; and reduce health-care costs to the system. </li>
    <li>The evidence suggests that even one short episode of brief intervention (BI) is efficacious in improving outcomes. BI is effective in motivating clients to change and encouraging those with more severe problems to consider referrals to specialized intervention services. It has been shown to decrease alcohol intake, risky drinking practices, and injury frequency. </li>
    <li>Benefits of improved collaboration and coordination across the system will include a reduction in avoidable visits to emergency rooms and hospitalizations, reduced wait times for community- and hospital-based services, and improved access to community supports, helping to address the needs of clients in a more timely manner. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implementation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2nd ed.) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see Appendix N in the original guideline document). </p>
<p><em>The Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health-care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Toolkit</em> uses the &quot;Knowledge-to-Action&quot; framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings. </p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of their Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies including: 1) the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&amp;reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; 2) nursing order sets which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments; and 3) the Best Practice Spotlight Organization&amp;reg; (BPSO&amp;reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. In addition, RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific guidelines and their implementation annually. </p>
