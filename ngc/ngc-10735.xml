	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Peninsula Technology Assessment group (PenTAG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of Manufacturers Search Strategy and Comment on Whether the Search Strategy Was Appropriate</strong></p>
<p>The ERG is content to accept the searches as submitted and including the additional information provided through clarification. The ERG draws the committee's attention to the fact that the literature search for clinical effectiveness was limited to adult only populations. The manufacturer has provided a rationale for this decision. The manufacturer did not provide a search strategy for indirect comparisons. The ERG raised the absence of searches as a question for clarification, and the manufacturer provided a response (see the ERG report).</p>
<p><em>Randomised Clinical Trials</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided information on the search strategy for clinical effectiveness. The database search strategies (as included in the manufacturer submission) are reproduced in Appendix A of the ERG report. In summary, searches were carried out in the following bibliographic databases:</p>
<ul disc=&quot;type&quot;>
    <li>MEDLINE (PubMed) </li>
    <li>MEDLINE In-Process (this content was accessed by using the PubMed interface, which contains the In-Process material) </li>
    <li>EMBASE (Dialog for the initial submission. Embase.com was used to update the literature searches) </li>
    <li>The Cochrane Library (Wiley interface), including: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) </li>
    <li>BIOSIS (via ProQuest, formally Dialog) </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the clinical trials registry, clinicaltrials.gov, was searched.</p>
<p>The following conference proceedings and Web sites were searched:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>American Society of Clinical Oncology </li>
    <li>European Society for Medical Oncology </li>
    <li>American Society of Hematology and its annual meeting </li>
</ul>
<p>The ERG notes that the British Society for Haematology Annual Meeting conference database was not searched.</p>
<p>The manufacturer limited these conference proceedings searches to the last 2 years. The ERG feels that this is highly restrictive, especially given that the study which forms the basis of this submission, is a conference abstract from 2009.</p>
<p>The searches were initially carried out on 21st August 2012, and an update search was performed on 20th December 2013. Population search terms (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/leukemia) were combined with intervention search terms (ofatumumab or chlorambucil, as well as other specified comparators, including bendamustine, rituximab or lenalidomide), and an appropriate balance of&amp;nbsp;Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), free-text and supplementary concept terms were used. A variety of synonyms were used to ensure an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity. The ERG notes, however, that some alterative names for the intervention were not included in the search (Humax, Humax-CD20, gsk 1841157, gsk1841157 and Humac). The ERG has run brief, supplementary searches, and find that the omission of these terms does not appear to have impacted on the retrieval. A suitable clinical trials filter was applied to the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches, and the manufacturer applied a randomized controlled trial (RCT) filter to the Cochrane and BIOSIS searches. The initial searches were not limited by publication date and so were run from database inception; the update searches were limited from 1st August 2012 to 20th December 2013.</p>
<p>The ERG is content to accept these searches. However, they note that in the manufacturer's report, all clinical effectiveness searches are limited to adult-only populations. This restriction is not in keeping with the scope and the ERG asked the manufacturer to repeat the searches, removing this restriction. They received the following response: &quot;The searches could be repeated to include the paediatric population, as requested, but this would require additional time. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, however, is a disease of the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years and it is unusual and very rare in children.&quot; See the ERG report for more information.</p>
<p>Whilst the ERG understands that the paediatric populations are not, in theory, relevant to the decision problem, this is not explicitly stated in the scope. The ERG cannot, therefore, exclude the possibility that relevant studies have been missed.</p>
<p><strong>Appropriateness of the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The submission included RCTs, non-RCTs, single-arm trials and prospective cohort studies, where the intervention was ofatumumab + chlorambucil, or ofatumumab + bendamustine.

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong><sup>a</sup></strong>Studies were not excluded based on the outcomes at the level 1 screen because outcomes can be difficult to determine from the abstract. Therefore, studies were excluded on the basis of outcomes only after the full text was reviewed at level 2.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the manufacturer's inclusion criteria, as provided in the table above, are broader than would be necessary to identify studies evaluating ofatumumab + chlorambucil or ofatumumab + bendamustine. This was done in order to identify studies that could be useful in an evidence network and in indirect treatment comparisons if possible. As such, the ERG considers that the inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate.</p>
<p>The submission also explains the process used in study selection (i.e., that two researchers independently reviewed titles and abstracts and the full-texts of studies, that differences in opinion were resolved through discussion to reach agreement, with a third senior researcher consulted where necessary). The ERG considers these methods to be appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Studies Not Included in the Submission</strong></p>
<p>The ERG has not identified any further relevant studies that are not included in the submission. The submission, therefore, appears to contain all relevant studies in this area.</p>

<p><em>Search Strategy</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided information on the search strategy. In summary, searches were carried out in the following bibliographic databases:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>MEDLINE (PubMed) </li>
    <li>MEDLINE In-Process (this content was accessed by using the PubMed interface, which contains the In-Process material) </li>
    <li>EMBASE (Dialog for the initial submission. Embase.com was used to update the literature searches) </li>
    <li>The Cochrane Library (Wiley interface) including: The National Health Service's Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) </li>
    <li>EconLIT (Dialog) </li>
    <li>BIOSIS (Dialog) </li>
</ul>
<p>The following conference proceedings and Web sites were searched for relevant abstracts:&amp;nbsp;</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research </li>
    <li>Key international health technology assessment Web sites, including National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) </li>
</ul>
<p>The ERG notes that the British Society for Haematology Annual Meeting conference proceedings were not searched.</p>
<p>In addition, reference lists of included economic analysis, reviews and health technology assessments were searched for relevant articles. Reference lists of any relevant studies, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses also were searched for sources.</p>
<p>The searches were run on 24th August 2012 and the update searches on 22nd October 2013. Population search terms (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/leukemia) were combined with intervention search terms (ofatumumab or chlorambucil, as well as other specified comparators, including bendamustine, rituximab and lenalidomide). An appropriate balance of MeSH, free-text and supplementary concept terms were used in the search strategy. A variety of synonyms were used to ensure an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity. The ERG notes, however, that some alterative names for the intervention were not included in the search (Humax, Humax-CD20, gsk 1841157, gsk1841157 and Humac). The ERG has run brief, supplementary searches, and find that the omission of these terms does not appear to have impacted on the retrieval. </p>
<p>The search results were date limited from 1st January 1997 to 22nd October 2013.</p>
<p>See Section 5.1.2.1 of the ERG report for the ERG comment on the search strategy.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Description and Critique of Manufacturer's Approach to Validity Assessment</strong></p>
<p><em>COMPLEMENT 1</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer reports the quality assessment of COMPLEMENT 1 according to the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) assessment criteria for risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Other details pertaining to the design and methods of COMPLEMENT 1 are also provided in the submission. A summary of these details are given in Table 13 of the ERG report, alongside the ERG critique.</p>
<p><em>Single-Arm Study OMB115991</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer reports the quality assessment of OMB115991 according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (2006). Other details pertaining to the design and methods of OMB115991 are also provided in the submission. A summary of these details are given in Table 14 of the ERG report, alongside the ERG critique.</p>
<p>The ERG thinks it important to highlight that OMB115991 is a single-arm study. The design of single-arm studies makes it difficult to assess and generalise results. Results from non-randomised studies may differ from RCT evidence, and case series design is considered to be the weakest source of clinical effectiveness evidence in the hierarchy of study designs.</p>
<p><strong>Description and Critique of Statistical Approaches Used</strong></p>
<p><em>COMPLEMENT 1</em></p>
<p>The primary analysis in this RCT was performed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) population using a data cut-off of 20th March 2013 (median follow-up at data cut-off was 878 days). No interim analyses were planned or performed, and the manufacturer has confirmed that no cut-offs later than 20th March 2013 regarding efficacy outcomes have since been performed. As stated in Table 13 of the ERG report, a longer follow-up would be preferable.</p>
<p>Pre-planned sensitivity, sub-group and post-hoc analyses were also undertaken. Sensitivity analyses were performed as follows: per protocol (PP) analysis, progression-free survival (PFS) with computed tomography (CT) scan, PFS adjusted for progression proclaimed by the investigator, PFS with worst case comparison and differential censoring, PFS based on common visits, investigator assessed PFS, and event-free survival (EFS). Sub-groups were categorised based upon: gender, age, race, geographical distribution, Rai and Binet staging, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, presence of constitutional symptoms, presence of comorbidities, presence of prognostic factors, reasons why a patient was considered inappropriate for fludarabine-containing regimen, and response. Post-hoc analyses were conducted for: demographics by region, baseline characteristics by region, prognostic markers by region, exposure by region, time in study by region, exclusion of subjects not considered fludarabine-inappropriate, creatinine clearance at screening. The ERG considers these to be appropriate post-hoc analyses.</p>
<p>The submission stated that secondary efficacy analyses of overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) would only be conducted if the primary endpoint was significant (to control the type I error rate). This is considered appropriate, as is the general statistical approach for secondary efficacy analyses.</p>
<p><em>Single-arm Study OMB115991</em></p>
<p>The primary analysis in this single-arm trial was performed on all enrolled participants, apart from one participant with missing data, using a data cut-off of 28th February 2013. Median duration on the study was approximately 8.5 months. A follow-up period of 36 months post-treatment is currently underway but follow-up data are not available. The manufacturer provides ORRs with 95% exact binomial confidence intervals, and also provides the proportion of participants suspected of achieving a primary endpoint of complete response (CR) who were minimal residual disease (MRD) positive. The ERG considers this to be suitable.</p>
<p>See Section 4 of the ERG report for additional information on clinical effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Summary of the Manufacturer's Submitted Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The submission includes a cohort model and uses the area under the curve (AUC) method for estimating transition probabilities. A diagrammatic representation of the model is given in Figure 23 of the ERG report.</p>
<p>Patients begin in a starting state of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia for whom fludarabine is not appropriate. These patients receive first-line therapy of either chlorambucil (Clb) or ofatumumab + chlorambucil (OfatClb). From this state, patients move to a state depending upon their response. Patients can have complete response, partial response or stable disease, where there is no response to treatment but they remain progression free; or their disease may progress. Patients who are progression free remain so until they experience disease progression or die.</p>
<p>After progression, patients may receive three further lines of treatment. From any line of treatment patients may progress to the state of progressed disease with best supportive care. For patients who respond to first-line treatment (complete or partial response), there is the option of retreatment in progressed disease, before moving to second line treatment. Retreatment and subsequent lines of treatment only affect costs and not quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).</p>
<p>Patients can die in any state.</p>
<p>The manufacturer also models the possibility of patients who suffer progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) as a result of their first-line treatment as a separate health state, due the long term impact of PML. PML was not detected in the COMPLEMENT 1 trial, and the incidence of PML is estimated from other sources.</p>
<p>The proportion of the cohort in each health state is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The total proportion alive is set to equal the overall survival curve. </li>
    <li>The proportion in one of the progression free health states (CR, partial response [PR], stable disease [SD]) is set to equal the relevant progression free survival curve. The total proportion in progression free is the sum of the proportions in each of the progression free health states, weighted by the proportions of patients in each response state. </li>
    <li>The proportion in the progression health state at each cycle is the difference between the proportion alive and the proportion progression free. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cycles in the model last three months and a half-cycle correction was applied.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Technology Appraisal Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that, after modifying the post-progression structure according to the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) exploratory analyses, the company's economic model was structurally acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was concerned that the log-normal distribution used by the company to extrapolate progression-free survival for ofatumumab plus chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil could overestimate the proportion of patients whose disease did not progress after trial follow-up ended. It concluded that using the Weibull distribution, as in the ERG's exploratory analyses, was more appropriate than the log-normal distribution used by the company for estimating long-term progression-free survival in this patient population.</p>
<p>The Committee accepted the clinical inputs in the ERG's exploratory base case for the comparison between ofatumumab plus chlorambucil and rituximab plus chlorambucil, based on the results of the indirect treatment comparison using COMPLEMENT 1 patient characteristics. It did, however, recall that the ERG's adjusted indirect treatment comparison using the CLL11 patient characteristics tended to favour rituximab plus chlorambucil.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that it accepted the pre-progression utility values derived from COMPLEMENT 1 data because the EuroQol Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised and validated generic instrument that is widely used and has been validated in many patient populations, as well as being NICE's preferred instrument.</p>
<p>The Committee noted that although there was uncertainty around the most appropriate post-progression utility value, it concluded that was not a key driver of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and that value used by the company in its base case was acceptable.</p>
<p>The Committee noted that the company's evidence submission stated that all relevant health-related benefits were likely to be included in the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the ERG's base-case exploratory analyses for ofatumumab plus chlorambucil compared with rituximab plus chlorambucil used an adjusted indirect comparison derived from COMPLEMENT 1 patient characteristics. This gave very similar total costs and total QALYs when the ofatumumab patient access scheme (PAS) was incorporated. It recalled that the ERG's exploratory sensitivity analyses that used CLL11 patient characteristics to inform the adjusted indirect treatment comparison showed that ofatumumab plus chlorambucil was dominated by rituximab plus chlorambucil when the ofatumumab PAS price was used (that is, it was more expensive and less effective).</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the ERG's exploratory base-case ICER of &amp;pound;26,000 per QALY gained, which incorporated the ofatumumab PAS, was the most plausible for ofatumumab plus chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil alone.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that, when using the ofatumumab PAS price, the cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab plus chlorambucil is likely to be similar to rituximab plus chlorambucil because of small differences in costs and QALYs.</p></div>"/>

    <li>This guidance represents the views of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>

    <li>Section 7(6) of the <a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made&quot; title=&quot;UK Legislation Web site&quot;>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013</a> requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Services (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>The Welsh Assembly Minister for Health and Social Services has issued directions to the NHS in Wales on implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 3 months of the guidance being published. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that ofatumumab is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>The Department of Health and the company have agreed that ofatumumab will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme which makes ofatumumab available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. At the time of the appraisal, the marketing authorisation holder was GlaxoSmithKline; however, it is now marketed by Novartis. It is the responsibility of the company to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. Any enquiries from NHS organisations about the patient access scheme should be directed to the company's commercial operations team on 01276 698717 or commercial.team@novartis.com. </li>
    <li>NICE has developed <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA344/resources&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>tools</a> to help organisations put this guidance into practice (listed below) (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).
