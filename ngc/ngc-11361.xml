	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li>Conduct a focused physical examination of the patient (e.g., vital signs, auscultation of the heart and lungs, evaluation of the airway,* and when appropriate to sedation, other organ systems where major abnormalities have been identified) </li>
    <li>Review available laboratory test results
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Order additional laboratory tests guided by a patient's medical condition, physical examination, and the likelihood that the results will affect the management of moderate sedation/analgesia </li>
        <li>Evaluate results of these tests before sedation is initiated </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If possible, perform the preprocedure evaluation well enough in advance (e.g., several days to weeks) to allow for optimal patient preparation&amp;dagger; </li>
    <li>Reevaluate the patient immediately before the procedure. </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*See Table 2 in the original guideline document for additional information related to airway assessment. </p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;This may not be feasible for urgent or emergency procedures, interventional radiology or other radiology settings.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Preprocedure Patient Preparation</span></strong> </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Consult with a medical specialist (e.g., physician anesthesiologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, nephrologist, pediatrician, obstetrician, or otolaryngologist), when appropriate before administration of moderate procedural sedation to patients with significant underlying conditions
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>If a specialist is needed, select a specialist based on the nature of the underlying condition and the urgency of the situation </li>
        <li>For severely compromised or medically unstable patients (e.g., American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] status IV, anticipated difficult airway, severe obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure) or if it is likely that sedation to the point of unresponsiveness will be necessary to obtain adequate conditions, consult with a physician anesthesiologist </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Before the procedure, inform patients or legal guardians of the benefits, risks, and limitations of moderate sedation/analgesia and possible alternatives, and elicit their preferences&amp;Dagger; </li>
    <li>Inform patients or legal guardians before the day of the procedure that they should not drink fluids or eat solid foods for a sufficient period of time to allow for gastric emptying before the procedure&amp;sect; </li>
    <li>On the day of the procedure, assess the time and nature of last oral intake
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Evaluate the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents when determining (1) the target level of sedation and (2) whether the procedure should be delayed </li>

    </li>
    <li>In urgent or emergent situations where complete gastric emptying is not possible, do not delay moderate procedural sedation based on fasting time alone </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;Dagger;This may not be feasible for urgent or emergency procedures. </p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;sect;See Table 3 in the original guideline document and/or refer to the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summary of the ASA guideline <a href=&quot;/summaries/summary/51133&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #11287&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Practice guidelines for preoperative fasting and the use of pharmacologic agents to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monitoring Patient Level of Consciousness</strong> </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Periodically (e.g., at 5-min intervals) monitor a patient's response to verbal commands during moderate sedation, except in patients who are unable to respond appropriately (e.g., patients where age or development may impair bidirectional communication) or during procedures where movement could be detrimental </li>
    <li>During procedures where a verbal response is not possible (e.g., oral surgery, restorative dentistry, upper endoscopy), check the patient's ability to give a &quot;thumbs up&quot; or other indication of consciousness in response to verbal or tactile (light tap) stimulation; this suggests that the patient will be able to control his airway and take deep breaths if necessary║ </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>║A response limited to reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is not considered a purposeful response and thus represents a state of general anesthesia. </p>
<p><strong>Monitoring Patient Ventilation and Oxygenation </strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Continually# monitor ventilatory function by observation of qualitative clinical signs </li>
    <li>Continually monitor ventilatory function with capnography unless precluded or invalidated by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment

<p>Findings from the aggregated literature are reported in the text of the original guideline document by evidence category, level, and direction. Evidence categories refer specifically to the strength and quality of the <em>research design</em> of the studies. Category A evidence represents results obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and category B evidence represents observational results obtained from nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups. When available, category A evidence is given precedence over category B evidence for any particular outcome. These evidence categories are further divided into evidence levels. Evidence levels refer specifically to the strength and quality of the summarized study <em>findings</em> (i.e., statistical findings, type of data, and the number of studies reporting/replicating the findings). In this document, only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention&amp;ndash;outcome pair, including a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocality.</p>
<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>
<p>RCTs report comparative findings between clinical interventions for specified outcomes. Statistically significant (<em>P</em>&amp;lt;0.01) outcomes are designated as either beneficial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E). </p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis,║ and meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as evidence. </p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains multiple RCTs, but the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these guidelines. Findings from these RCTs are reported separately as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains a single RCT and findings from this study are reported as evidence.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>║All meta-analyses are conducted by the ASA methodology group. Meta-analyses from other sources are reviewed but not included as evidence in this document. A minimum of five independent RCTs are required for meta-analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Category B</strong></p>
<p>Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups may permit inference of beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and clinical outcomes. Inferred findings are given a directional designation of beneficial (B), harmful (H), or equivocal (E). For studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is <em>P</em>&amp;lt;0.01. </p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains nonrandomized comparisons (e.g., quasiexperimental, cohort [prospective or retrospective], or case-control research designs) with comparative statistics between clinical interventions for a specified clinical outcome.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with associative statistics (e.g., relative risk, correlation, sensitivity, and specificity). </p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, percentages). </p>
<p><em>Level 4</em>: The literature contains case reports. </p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Literature</strong></p>
<p>The <em>lack</em> of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable (i.e., no pertinent studies found) or inadequate. Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes because a clear interpretation of findings is not obtained due to methodological concerns (e.g., confounding of study design or implementation) or the study does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the &quot;Focus&quot; of the guidelines. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Opinion-based Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>All opinion-based evidence (e.g., survey data, open forum testimony, internet-based comments, letters, and editorials) relevant to each topic was considered in the development of these guidelines. However, only the findings obtained from formal surveys are reported in the document. </p>
<p>Opinion surveys were developed by the task force to address each clinical intervention identified in the document. Identical surveys were distributed to expert consultants and a random sample of members of the participating organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Expert and Participating Membership Opinion Surveys</strong> </p>
<p>Survey findings from task force&amp;ndash;appointed expert consultants, a random sample of the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) membership, and membership samples from the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) and the American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists (ASDA) are fully reported in this document. Survey responses were recorded using a 5-point scale and summarized based on median values. </p>
<p><em>Strongly Agree</em>: Median score of 5 (at least 50% of the responses are 5) </p>
<p><em>Agree</em>: Median score of 4 (at least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5) </p>
<p><em>Equivocal</em>: Median score of 3 (at least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other response category or combination of similar categories contain at least 50% of the responses) </p>
<p><em>Disagree</em>: Median score of 2 (at least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2) </p>
<p><em>Strongly Disagree</em>: Median score of 1 (at least 50% of responses are 1) </p>
<p><strong>Informal Opinion </strong></p>
<p>Open forum testimony obtained during development of these guidelines, internet-based comments, letters, and editorials are all informally evaluated and discussed during the formulation of guideline recommendations. When warranted, the task force may add educational information or cautionary notes based on this information.</p></div>"/>

<p>Interobserver agreement among task force members and two methodologists was obtained by interrater reliability testing of 36 randomly selected studies. Agreement levels using a &amp;kappa; statistic for two-rater agreement pairs were as follows: (1) research design, &amp;kappa; = 0.57 to 0.92; (2) type of analysis, &amp;kappa; = 0.60 to 0.75; (3) evidence linkage assignment, &amp;kappa; = 0.76 to 0.85; and (4) literature inclusion for database, &amp;kappa; = 0.28 to 1.00.

<p>Consensus was obtained from multiple sources, including: (1) survey opinion from consultants&amp;dagger; who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in moderate procedural sedation and analgesia; (2) survey opinions from a randomly selected sample of active members of the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA), American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), and American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists (ASDA)&amp;Dagger;; (3) testimony from attendees of publicly held open forums at national anesthesia meetings&amp;sect;; (4) internet commentary; and (5) task force opinion and interpretation. The survey rate of return was 81% (n=129 of 159) for consultants. For membership respondents, survey data were collected from 69 ASA members, 104 AAOMS members, and 104 ASDA members. The results of the surveys are reported in Tables 7&amp;ndash;10 in the original guideline document and are summarized in the text of the guidelines. </p>
<p>Consultants were asked to indicate which, if any, of the evidence linkages would change their clinical practices if the guidelines were instituted. The rate of return was 34.6% (n=55 of 159). The percent of responding consultants expecting no change associated with each linkage were as follows (preprocedure patient evaluation &amp;ndash; %): preprocedure patient preparation &amp;ndash; 93.75%; patient preparation &amp;ndash; 87.5%; patient monitoring &amp;ndash; 68.75%; supplemental oxygen &amp;ndash; 93.75%; emergency support &amp;ndash; 87.5%; sedative or analgesic medications not intended for general anesthesia &amp;ndash; 87.5%; sedative or analgesic medications intended for general anesthesia &amp;ndash; 75.0%%; availability/use of reversal agents &amp;ndash; 87.5%; recovery care &amp;ndash; 75%; and creation and implementation of patient safety processes &amp;ndash; 56.25%. Forty-four respondents (84.62%) indicated that the guidelines would have <em>no effect</em> on the amount of time spent on a typical case with the implementation of these guidelines. Seven respondents (13.46%) indicated that there would be an increase in the amount of time, with four of these respondents estimating an increase ranging from 5 to 15 min. One respondent (1.92%) estimated a decrease in the amount of time they would spend on a typical case. </p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;Consultants were drawn from the following specialties where moderate procedural sedation/analgesia are commonly administered: anesthesiology, cardiology, dentistry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, pediatrics, radiology, and surgery.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;Dagger;All participating organizations were invited to participate in this survey. </p>

<p>These guidelines were developed by an American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA)&amp;ndash;appointed task force of 13 members, consisting of physician anesthesiologists in both private and academic practices from various geographic areas of the United States, a cardiologist, a dentist anesthesiologist, an oral/maxillofacial surgeon, a radiologist, an ASA staff methodologist, and two consulting methodologists for the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters. </p>
<p>The task force developed these guidelines by means of a seven-step process. First, criteria for evidence associated with moderate sedation and analgesia techniques were established. Second, original published research studies relevant to the guidelines were reviewed and analyzed; only articles relevant to the administration of moderate sedation were evaluated. Third, a panel of expert consultants was asked to (1) participate in opinion surveys on the effectiveness and safety of various methods and interventions that might be used during sedation/analgesia and (2) review and comment on a draft of the guidelines developed by the task force. Fourth, survey opinions about the guideline recommendations were solicited from a random sample of active members of the ASA and participating medical specialty societies. Fifth, the task force held open forums at major national meetings to solicit input on its draft recommendations.&amp;sect; National organizations representing specialties whose members typically provide moderate sedation were invited to participate in the open forums. Sixth, the consultants were surveyed to assess their opinions on the feasibility of implementing the guidelines. Seventh, all available information was used to build consensus within the task force to finalize the guidelines.</p>

    <li>Practitioners are cautioned that acute reversal of opioid-induced analgesia may result in pain, hypertension, tachycardia, or pulmonary edema. </li>
    <li>If the patient response results in deeper sedation than intended, these sedation practices can be associated with cardiac or respiratory depression that must be rapidly recognized and appropriately managed to avoid the risk of hypoxic brain damage, cardiac arrest, or death.

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>These guidelines specifically apply to the level of sedation corresponding to moderate sedation/analgesia (previously called conscious sedation), which is defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully&amp;dagger; to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. (Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is NOT considered a purposeful response.) No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway when spontaneous ventilation is adequate.&amp;Dagger; Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. For these guidelines, analgesia refers to the management of patient pain or discomfort during and after procedures requiring moderate sedation. </li>
    <li>The appropriate choice of agents and techniques for moderate sedation/analgesia is dependent upon the experience, training, and preference of the individual practitioner, requirements or constraints imposed by associated medical issues of the patient or type of procedure, and the risk of producing a deeper level of sedation than anticipated. In some cases, the choice of agents or techniques are limited by federal, state, or municipal regulations or statutes. Because it is not always possible to predict how a specific patient will respond to sedative and analgesic medications, practitioners intending to produce a given level of sedation should be able to rescue patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than initially intended. For moderate sedation, this implies the ability to manage a compromised airway or hypoventilation, and support cardiovascular function in patients who become hypotensive, hypertensive, bradycardic, or tachycardic. </li>
    <li>Because minimal sedation (anxiolysis) may entail minimal risk, the guidelines specifically exclude it. Additional interventions excluded from these guidelines include but are not limited to patient-controlled sedation/analgesia, sedatives administered before or during regional and central neuraxis anesthesia, premedication for general anesthesia, interventions without sedatives (e.g., hypnosis, acupuncture), new or rarely administered sedative/analgesics, new or rarely used monitoring or delivery devices, and automated sedative delivery systems. These guidelines do not address education, training, or certification requirements for practitioners who provide moderate procedural sedation. </li>
    <li>Practice guidelines are systematically developed recommendations that assist the practitioner and patient in making decisions about health care. These recommendations may be adopted, modified, or rejected according to clinical needs and constraints and are not intended to replace local institutional policies. In addition, these practice guidelines are not intended as standards or absolute requirements, and their use cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Practice guidelines are subject to revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. They provide basic recommendations that are supported by a synthesis and analysis of the current literature, expert and practitioner opinion, open forum commentary, and clinical feasibility data. </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is NOT considered a purposeful response. </p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;Dagger;However, as stated in the American Academy of Pediatrics&amp;ndash;American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry guidelines on the monitoring and management of pediatric patients during sedation (2016), &quot;in the case of procedures that may themselves cause airway obstruction (e.g., dental or endoscopic), the practitioner must recognize an obstruction and assist the patient in opening the airway.&quot;</p>"/>
