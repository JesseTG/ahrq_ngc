	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent type of valvular heart disease in Europe and North America. It primarily presents as calcific AS in adults of advanced age (2%&amp;ndash;7% of the population &amp;gt;65 years of age). Although aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a definitive therapy for patients who meet the criteria for severe AS, 32% to 48% of those patients do not undergo conventional AVR due to their advanced age, comorbidities, or prohibitive surgical risk. </p>
<p>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has dramatically impacted the management of high surgical risk patients by enabling a less invasive approach using a transfemoral, transapical, or other vascular access route to position a prosthesis at the aortic annulus that displaces the native aortic valve leaflets toward the aortic wall. Procedure-related complications are linked to inaccurate estimates of annular geometry; unlike surgical AVR, the aortic annulus is not directly inspected by the proceduralist at the time of the procedure, and multiple parameters related to the annulus should be measured. As the annulus has a complex geometry, volumetric data (computed tomography [CT] in particular) have emerged with standardized reformatting along patient-specific anatomic planes for annular assessment and device sizing. </p>
<p>TAVR planning at or near the aortic annulus is essential because accurate measurements guide optimal choices for device sizing and deployment, with a secondary reduction in TAVR&amp;ndash;related complications. Because the transfemoral approach is favored and most commonly used, and because the catheter-based system ranges in size between 14 Fr and 24 Fr, the entire aorta and branches to potential access points (e.g., the femoral arteries) must be evaluated for the presence, burden, and distribution of peripheral vascular atherosclerosis. </p>
<p>This document has two limitations in scope. First, the panel did not consider the diagnosis of AS or the assessment of coronary artery disease. It is presumed that patients considered in this document are otherwise suitable candidates for TAVR. Second, the panel did not consider planning done at the time of intervention with either catheter angiography, echocardiography done at the time of catheterization, or a combination of both. </p>
<p>Instead, for this document the panel only considered the two clinical tasks required for preprocedure screening: (Variant 1) annular sizing and root evaluation to see if a device is suitable for deployment for patients with no past history of aortic valve surgery or prior TAVR, and then to help guide the choice of the valve prosthesis, considering and minimizing potential complications via multiple measurements; and (Variant 2) imaging the remainder of the aorta and iliofemoral arteries to determine the feasibility of the preferred transfemoral approach, and when this route is high risk, to assess potential alternate access routes.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Procedures by Variant</strong></p>
<p><em>Variant 1: Preintervention Planning for TAVR at the Aortic Valve Plane</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>CT and CTA</span></p>
<p>Retrospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated CT angiography (CTA) is the first-line modality for preprocedural annular sizing, as it enables direct planimetry and reference standard measurements for all required annular parameters for TAVR deployment. Multiple single- and multicenter trials have consistently shown that integration of CTA in preprocedural planning helps reduce the rate of significant paravalvular regurgitation and also allows for the discrimination of risk of annular rupture, coronary occlusion, and vascular injury. Guiding optimum fluoroscopic projections with co-planar angles of the aortic root facilitates appropriate valve deployment. In addition, CTA provides data regarding the distribution of valve calcification. Whereas vascular access is typically extracardiac (and evaluated in the second variant), when introduction of the TAVR system via the cardiac apex is being considered, CTA is essential for planning. </p>
<p>Noncontrast CT can be used to evaluate valve calcification; however, the incremental role in procedural planning remains uncertain, its primary role is in assisting the diagnosis of AS and not for guiding TAVR. When iodinated contrast is absolutely contraindicated, an alternate method for TAVR planning is generally required. For the large majority of patients who undergo CT for TAVR planning, contrast is administered for first-pass CTA (CTA chest with intravenous [IV] contrast) so that the annular size and related measurements can be performed after image postprocessing. There is essentially no role for imaging the chest after the first pass of contrast or for performing this acquisition after a noncontrast study (CT chest without and with IV contrast). </p>
<p>For the purposes of distinguishing between CT and CTA, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria topics use the definition in the <a href=&quot;https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Practice-Parameters/body-cta.pdf?la=en&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>Practice Parameter for the Performance and Interpretation of Body Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)</a>: &quot;CTA uses a thin-section CT acquisition that is timed to coincide with peak arterial or venous enhancement. The resultant volumetric dataset is interpreted using primary transverse reconstructions as well as multiplanar reformations and 3-D renderings.&quot; </p>
<p>All procedure elements are essential: (1) timing, (2) recons/reformats, and (3) 3-D renderings. Standard CTs with contrast also include timing issues and recons/reformats. Only in CTA, however, is 3-D rendering a <strong>required</strong> element. This corresponds to the definitions that CMS has applied to the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Echocardiography</span></p>
<p>Although 2-D transesophageal echocardiography was the initial method of choice for annular sizing, this method has been replaced with 3-D acquisitions to help with annular sizing. Annular measurements are reproducible and correlate with reference standard CTA. Compared to CT, there is significantly less data for evaluating root features such as coronary ostial height and the presence or absence of sub-annular calcification. It is more commonly used at the time of the procedure, utilization that is not being assessed in this guideline, rather than for planning. In the setting of contraindications for CT such as anaphylaxis and severe renal dysfunction, 3-D transesophageal echocardiography is commonly used to assess annular geometry and size. Of note, when echocardiography is used for TAVR planning, transthoracic acquisition (though used in the diagnosis of AS) is not used and was not considered in ratings. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>MRA</span></p>
<p>Although magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) provides highly accurate, low variability annular measurements for patients undergoing surgical AVR, there is only modest clinical adoption, and there is a paucity of supporting data for TAVR planning compared to CTA. MRA-based measurements do correlate with CT; therefore, MRA could be an alternative to CTA when there is a severe iodine-based contraindication. MRA approaches are limited when there is high-susceptibility artifact, magnetic field-incompatible devices, claustrophobia, and severe arrhythmia. Finally, the MRA examination is substantially longer than the CT acquisition, which can be problematic for patients with a poor clinical condition. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Aortography</span></p>
<p>Whereas catheterization images acquired at the time of the procedure are necessary and complementary to planning, increasing data questions the need to perform preprocedural catheterization, based on the fact that all necessary parameters can typically be extracted from the CT images. Specifically, the 2-D projections may not adequately reflect the complex geometry of the aortic annulus. Instead, catheterization images focus on the assessment of root geometry and coronary height. </p>
<p><em>Variant 2: Preintervention Planning for TAVR in the Supravalvular Aorta and Iliofemoral System</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>CT and CTA</span></p>
<p>CTA acquisition with isotropic voxels enables image postprocessing to accurately depict geometry, lumen size, and the presence of dissections, atherosclerotic disease, and subsequent stenosis from the entire arterial system between the supravalvular aorta and the femoral arteries, the preferred TAVR access point. CTA also best identifies concentric or horseshoe calcification that is a relative contraindication for TAVR, especially in those with borderline vessel diameter. CTA is also essential for atypical TAVR apparatus access points such as transaortic or transcaval approaches. </p>
<p>Whereas CTA is preferred for patients with a strong contraindication to contrast injection, noncontrast imaging can be used to evaluate calcification within the aorta and including the iliofemoral arteries under evaluation for access. If a patient receives IV contrast, CTA images should be acquired, as opposed to later phase imaging (CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast). Moreover, there would be no role for performing this acquisition after a noncontrast study (CT abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast). </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Aortography</span></p>
<p>Though catheter angiography allows assessment of luminal size, it provides limited evaluation of the arterial wall for plaque burden and calcification. Standard catheter angiography is also limited in that it is typically planar and therefore is limited in its capacity to evaluate tortuosity and for the detection of eccentric stenosis. Angiography also plays a limited role in the evaluation of patients for whom alternate access is being considered. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>IVUS</span></p>
<p>Whereas ultrasound (US) is often used to facilitate arterial puncture, surface-based sonography is insufficient to comprehensively assess arterial size, calcification, and tortuosity of the iliofemoral system and the aorta. There is little or no data regarding the usefulness of intravascular US (IVUS) for TAVR planning. Studies in abdominal aortic aneurysm subjects suggest that IVUS provides reliable information of aortoiliofemoral anatomy, especially luminal dimension, presence of and morphology of atherosclerotic plaque, and calcification. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>MRA</span></p>
<p>MRA provides an alternative to CT for evaluation of the aorta and iliofemoral arteries. However, it is limited in the assessment of vascular calcification. </p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Preintervention planning for TAVR at the aortic valve plane: 3-D cross sectional imaging of the aortic annular plane is essential with CTA of the chest with IV contrast being the first-line modality. </li>
    <li>Preintervention planning for TAVR in the supravalvular aorta and iliofemoral system: CTA abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the preferred and first-line modality for vascular access assessment to identify those patients with potential risk for compromised intra-procedural vascular access. </li>

<p>A literature search was conducted in March 2015 and June 2017 to identify additional evidence published since the <em>ACR Appropriateness Criteria&amp;reg; Imaging for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement</em> topic was finalized. Using the search strategies described in the literature search companion (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), 578 articles were found. Four articles were added to the bibliography. The remaining articles were not used due to either poor study design, the articles were not relevant or generalizable to the topic, or the results were unclear or biased. </p>
<p>The author added 16 citations from bibliographies, Web sites, or books that were not found in the literature searches. </p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the rating rounds is to systematically and transparently determine the panels' recommendations while mitigating any undue influence of one or more panel members on another individual panel members' interpretation of the evidence. The panel member's rating is determined by reviewing the evidence presented in the Summary of Literature Review and assessing the risks or harms of performing the procedure or treatment balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure or treatment. The individual panel member ratings are used to calculate the median rating, which determines the panel's rating. The assessment of the amount of deviation of individual ratings from the panel rating determines whether there is disagreement among the panel about the rating. </p>
<p>The process used in the rating rounds is a modified Delphi method based on the methodology described in the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual. </p>
<p>The appropriateness is rated on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Determining the Panel's Recommendation</span></strong> </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Ratings represent an individual's assessment of the risks and benefits of performing a specific procedure for a specific clinical scenario on an ordinal scale. The recommendation is the appropriateness category (i.e., &quot;Usually appropriate,&quot; &quot;May be appropriate,&quot; or &quot;Usually not appropriate&quot;). </li>
    <li>The appropriateness category for a procedure and clinical scenario is determined by the panel's median rating without disagreement (see below for definition of disagreement). The panel's median rating is calculated after each rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the rating category is &quot;May be appropriate (Disagreement)&quot; with a rating of &quot;5&quot; so users understand the group disagreed on the final recommendation. The actual panel median rating is documented to provide additional context. </li>
    <li>Disagreement is defined as excessive dispersion of the individual ratings from the group (in this case, an Appropriateness Criteria [AC] panel) median as determined by comparison of the interpercentile range (IPR) and the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry (IPRAS). In those instances when the IPR is greater than the IPRAS, there is disagreement. For a complete discussion, please refer to chapter 8 of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual. </li>
    <li>Once the final recommendations have been determined, the panel reviews the document. If two thirds of the panel feel a final recommendation is wrong (e.g., does not accurately reflect the evidence, may negatively impact patient health, has unintended consequences that may harm health care, etc.) and the process must be started again from the beginning. </li>
</ul>

<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria&amp;reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

    <li>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. </li>
    <li>ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply society endorsement of the final document. </li>

<p>An important aspect of committee operations is the disclosure and management of potential conflicts of interest. In 2016, the American College of Radiology (ACR) began an organization-wide review of its conflict of interest (COI) policies. The current ACR COI policy is available on its <a href=&quot;https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Member-Resources/Volunteer/Conflict-of-Interest-Policy.pdf/la/en&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>Web site</a>. The Appropriateness Criteria (AC) program's COI process varies from the organization's current policy to accommodate the requirements for qualified provider-led entities as designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) program. </p>
<p>When physicians become participants in the AC program, welcome letters are sent to inform them of their panel roles and responsibilities, including a link to complete the <a href=&quot;https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Appropriateness-Criteria/ACCOI-form.pdf/la/en&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>COI form</a>. The COI form requires disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest. ACR staff oversees the COI evaluation process, coordinating with review panels consisting of ACR staff and members, who determine when there is a conflict of interest and what action, if any, is appropriate. In addition to making the information publicly available, management may include exclusion from some topic processes, exclusion from a topic, or exclusion from the panel. </p>
<p>Besides potential COI disclosure, AC staff begins every committee call with the conflict of interest disclosure statement listed below reminding members to update their COI forms. If any updates to their COI information have not been submitted, they are instructed not to participate in discussion where an undisclosed conflict may exist. </p>
<p>Finally, all ACR AC are published as part of the Journal of the American College of Radiology (JACR) electronic supplement. Those who participated on the document and are listed as authors must complete the JACR process that includes completing the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) COI form which is reviewed by the journal's staff/publisher.</p>
