	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC and NICE</strong>: In July 2016, NICE reworded the recommendation on screening for eye disease to clarify the role of general practitioners (GPs) in referring people for eye screening and also to add information on when this should happen. This change is reflected in the recommendations below.</p>
<p>Recommendations are marked as <strong>[new 2015]</strong>, <strong>[2015]</strong>, <strong>[2009]</strong>, <strong>[2009, amended 2015]</strong> or <strong>[2009, amended 2016]</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>[new 2015]</strong> indicates that the evidence has been reviewed and the recommendation has been added or updated. </li>
    <li><strong>[2015]</strong> indicates that the evidence has been reviewed but no change has been made to the recommended action. </li>
    <li><strong>[2009]</strong> indicates that the evidence has not been reviewed since 2009. </li>
    <li><strong>[2009, amended 2015]</strong> or <strong>[2009, amended 2016]</strong> indicates that the evidence has not been reviewed since 2009, but either changes have been made to the recommendation wording that change the meaning or NICE has made editorial changes to the original wording to clarify the action to be taken. </li>
</ul>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Individualised Care</span></strong></p>
<p>Adopt an individualised approach to diabetes care that is tailored to the needs and circumstances of adults with type 2 diabetes, taking into account their personal preferences, comorbidities, risks from polypharmacy, and their ability to benefit from long‑term interventions because of reduced life expectancy. Such an approach is especially important in the context of multimorbidity. Reassess the person's needs and circumstances at each review and think about whether to stop any medicines that are not effective. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>Take into account any disabilities, including visual impairment, when planning and delivering care for adults with type 2 diabetes. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Education</span></strong></p>
<p>Offer structured education to adults with type 2 diabetes and/or their family members or carers (as appropriate) at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review. Explain to people and their carers that structured education is an integral part of diabetes care. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that any structured education programme for adults with type 2 diabetes includes the following components:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>It is evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person. </li>
    <li>It has specific aims and learning objectives, and supports the person and their family members and carers in developing attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills to self‑manage diabetes. </li>
    <li>It has a structured curriculum that is theory-driven, evidence-based and resource-effective, has supporting materials, and is written down. </li>
    <li>It is delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the person, and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme. </li>
    <li>It is quality assured, and reviewed by trained, competent, independent assessors who measure it against criteria that ensure consistency. </li>
    <li>The outcomes are audited regularly. <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure the patient-education programme provides the necessary resources to support the educators, and that educators are properly trained and given time to develop and maintain their skills. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Offer group education programmes as the preferred option. Provide an alternative of equal standard for a person unable or unwilling to participate in group education. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that the patient-education programmes available meet the cultural, linguistic, cognitive and literacy needs within the local area. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that all members of the diabetes healthcare team are familiar with the patient‑education programmes available locally, that these programmes are integrated with the rest of the care pathway, and that adults with type 2 diabetes and their family members or carers (as appropriate) have the opportunity to contribute to the design and provision of local programmes. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Dietary Advice</span></strong></p>
<p>Provide individualised and ongoing nutritional advice from a healthcare professional with specific expertise and competencies in nutrition. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Provide dietary advice in a form sensitive to the person's needs, culture and beliefs, being sensitive to their willingness to change and the effects on their quality of life. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Emphasise advice on healthy balanced eating that is applicable to the general population when providing advice to adults with type 2 diabetes. Encourage high-fibre, low-glycaemic-index sources of carbohydrate in the diet, such as fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and pulses; include low‑fat dairy products and oily fish; and control the intake of foods containing saturated and trans fatty acids. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>For adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight, set an initial body weight loss target of 5% to 10%. Remember that lesser degrees of weight loss may still be of benefit, and that larger degrees of weight loss in the longer term will have advantageous metabolic impact. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Individualise recommendations for carbohydrate and alcohol intake, and meal patterns. Reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia should be a particular aim for a person using insulin or an insulin secretagogue. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Advise adults with type 2 diabetes that limited substitution of sucrose-containing foods for other carbohydrate in the meal plan is allowable, but that they should take care to avoid excess energy intake. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Discourage the use of foods marketed specifically for people with diabetes. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>When adults with type 2 diabetes are admitted to hospital as inpatients or to any other care setting, implement a meal planning system that provides consistency in the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>For recommendations on lifestyle advice, see the NICE guidelines on <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng7&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>preventing excess weight gain</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph53&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>weight management</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph44&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>physical activity</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph1&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>smoking: brief interventions and referrals</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph10&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>stop smoking services</a>, <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>smoking: harm reduction</a>, and <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph48&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>smoking: acute, maternity and mental health services</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Blood Pressure Management</span></strong></p>
<p>Measure blood pressure at least annually in an adult with type 2 diabetes without previously diagnosed hypertension or renal disease. Offer and reinforce preventive lifestyle advice. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>For an adult with type 2 diabetes on antihypertensive drug treatment when diabetes is diagnosed, review blood pressure control and medications used. Make changes only if there is poor control or if current drug treatment is not appropriate because of microvascular complications or metabolic problems. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Repeat blood pressure measurements within:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>1 month if blood pressure is higher than 150/90 mmHg </li>
    <li>2 months if blood pressure is higher than 140/80 mmHg </li>
    <li>2 months if blood pressure is higher than 130/80 mmHg and there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage </li>
</ul>
<p>Provide lifestyle advice (diet and exercise) at the same time. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Provide lifestyle advice (see &quot;Dietary Advice&quot; above in this guideline and the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg127&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>Hypertension. Clinical management of primary hypertension in adults</a>) if blood pressure is confirmed as being consistently above 140/80 mmHg (or above 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg (below 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Monitor blood pressure every 1 to 2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140/80 mmHg (below 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>First-line antihypertensive drug treatment should be a once-daily, generic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Exceptions to this are people of African or Caribbean family origin, or women for whom there is a possibility of becoming pregnant. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>The first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a person of African or Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or a generic calcium-channel blocker. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>A calcium-channel blocker should be the first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a woman for whom, after an informed discussion, it is agreed there is a possibility of her becoming pregnant. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist to treat hypertension. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic). Add the other drug (that is, the calcium-channel blocker or diuretic) if the target is not reached with dual therapy. <strong>[2009, amended 2015]</strong></p>
<p>If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Monitor the blood pressure of a person who has attained and consistently remained at his or her blood pressure target every 4 to 6 months. Check for possible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment &amp;ndash; including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Antiplatelet Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>Do not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) for adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>For guidance on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NGC summaries of the NICE guidelines <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=48406&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10501&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Lipid modification: cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease</a> and <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=47700&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10185&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>MI - secondary prevention.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Blood Glucose Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>HbA1c Measurement and Targets</strong></p>
<p><em>Measurement</em></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, measure glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels at:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>3- to 6-monthly intervals (tailored to individual needs), until the HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy </li>
    <li>6-monthly intervals once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Use methods to measure HbA1c that have been calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>If HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using one of the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality-controlled plasma glucose profiles </li>
    <li>Total HbA1c estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins) </li>
    <li>Fructosamine estimation <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Investigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or clinical biochemistry. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p><em>Targets</em></p>
<p>Involve adults with type 2 diabetes in decisions about their individual HbA1c target. Encourage them to achieve the target and maintain it unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or their efforts to achieve their target, impair their quality of life. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve and maintain their HbA1c target (see &quot;Dietary Advice&quot; above). For more information about supporting adherence, see the NICE guideline on <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg76&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>medicines adherence</a>.<strong> [new 2015]</strong> </p>
<p>For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Intensify drug treatment <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations above) on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration for people who are older or frail, for adults with type 2 diabetes:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Who are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy </li>
    <li>For whom tight blood glucose control poses a high risk of the consequences of hypoglycaemia, for example, people who are at risk of falling, people who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, and people who drive or operate machinery as part of their job </li>
    <li>For whom intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, people with significant comorbidities <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>For guidance on HbA1c targets for women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49120&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10691&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Diabetes in pregnancy: management of diabetes and its complications from preconception to the postnatal period</a>. <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </p>

<p>Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The person is on insulin <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>There is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes <strong>or</strong> </li>

    <li>To confirm suspected hypoglycaemia <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment should include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The person's self-monitoring skills </li>
    <li>The quality and frequency of testing </li>
    <li>Checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take </li>

    <li>The continued benefit to the person </li>
    <li>The equipment used <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drug Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations in this section that cover dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics and sulfonylureas refer to each of these groups of drugs at a class level.</p>
<p>For adults with type 2 diabetes, discuss the benefits and risks of drug treatment, and the options available. Base the choice of drug treatment(s) on:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The effectiveness of the drug treatment(s) in terms of metabolic response </li>
    <li>Safety (see <a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update&quot; title=&quot;UK Government Web site&quot;>Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [MHRA] guidance</a>) and tolerability of the drug treatment(s) </li>
    <li>The person's individual clinical circumstances, for example, comorbidities, risks from polypharmacy </li>
    <li>The person's individual preferences and needs </li>
    <li>The licensed indications or combinations available </li>
    <li>Cost (if 2 drugs in the same class are appropriate, choose the option with the lowest acquisition cost) <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rescue Therapy at Any Phase of Treatment</em></p>
<p>If an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider insulin (see recommendations below) or a sulfonylurea, and review treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p><em>Initial Drug Treatment</em></p>
<p>Offer standard-release metformin as the initial drug treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>Gradually increase the dose of standard-release metformin over several weeks to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in adults with type 2 diabetes. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>If an adult with type 2 diabetes experiences gastrointestinal side effects with standard-release metformin, consider a trial of modified-release metformin. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, review the dose of metformin if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is below 45 ml/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Stop metformin if the eGFR is below 30 ml/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. </li>

</ul>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment<sup>1</sup> with:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or </li>
    <li>Pioglitazone<sup>2</sup> or </li>
    <li>A sulfonylurea <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, do not offer or continue pioglitazone<sup>2</sup> if they have any of the following: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Heart failure or history of heart failure </li>
    <li>Hepatic impairment </li>

    <li>Uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>First Intensification of Drug Treatment</em></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>Metformin and pioglitazone<sup>2</sup> <strong>or</strong> </li>

</ul>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy<sup>3</sup> with:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A DPP‑4 inhibitor and pioglitazone<sup>2</sup> <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>A DPP‑4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea <strong>or</strong> </li>

<p>Treatment with combinations of medicines including sodium&amp;ndash;glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT‑2) inhibitors may be appropriate for some people with type 2 diabetes; see the NICE guidance on <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta315&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>canagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta288&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>Dapagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes</a>, and the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49124&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10695&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Empagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes</a>.</p>
<p><em>Second Intensification of Drug Treatment</em></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation above) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either:</p>

    <li>Starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations below) <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation above) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) <strong>and</strong> specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity <strong>or</strong> </li>

</ul>
<p>Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol/mol [1.0%] in HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months). <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation above) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations below). <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, only offer a GLP-1 mimetic in combination with insulin with specialist care advice and ongoing support from a consultant‑led multidisciplinary team<sup>4</sup>. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>Treatment with combinations of medicines including SGLT‑2 inhibitors may be appropriate for some people with type 2 diabetes; see the NICE guidance on <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta315&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>canagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta288&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>Dapagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes</a>, and the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49124&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10695&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Empagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes</a>.</p>

    <li>Who cannot use the device needed to inject NPH insulin but who could administer their own insulin safely and accurately if a switch to one of the long-acting insulin analogues was made <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>Who need help from a carer or healthcare professional to administer insulin injections and for whom switching to one of the long-acting insulin analogues would reduce the number of daily injections <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine<sup>6</sup>) for the need for short-acting insulin before meals (or a pre-mixed [biphasic] insulin preparation). <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p>Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on pre‑mixed (biphasic) insulin for the need for a further injection of short‑acting insulin before meals or for a change to a basal bolus regimen with NPH insulin or insulin detemir or insulin glargine<sup>6</sup>, if blood glucose control remains inadequate. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>

<p>Think about the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the gut in adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained diarrhoea that happens particularly at night. <strong>[2009, amended 2015]</strong></p>
<p>When using tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes who have autonomic neuropathy, be aware of the increased likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Investigate the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the bladder in adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained bladder-emptying problems. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>In managing autonomic neuropathy symptoms, include specific interventions indicated by the manifestations (for example, for abnormal sweating or nocturnal diarrhoea). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diabetic Foot Problems</strong></p>
<p>For guidance on preventing and managing foot problems in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49566&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10691&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Diabetic foot problems: prevention and management</a>. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diabetic Kidney Disease</strong></p>
<p>For guidance on managing kidney disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=48405&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10500&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Chronic kidney disease. Early identification and management of chronic kidney disease in adults in primary and secondary care</a>. <strong>[new 2015] </strong></p>
<p><strong>Erectile Dysfunction</strong></p>
<p>Offer men with type 2 diabetes the opportunity to discuss erectile dysfunction as part of their annual review. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p>Assess, educate and support men with type 2 diabetes who have problematic erectile dysfunction, addressing contributory factors such as cardiovascular disease as well as possible treatment options. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p>Consider a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor to treat problematic erectile dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes, initially choosing the drug with the lowest acquisition cost and taking into account any contraindications. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>Following discussion, refer men with type 2 diabetes to a service offering other medical, surgical or psychological management of erectile dysfunction if treatment (including a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, as appropriate) has been unsuccessful. <strong>[2015] </strong></p>
<p><strong>Eye Disease</strong></p>
<p>On diagnosis, GPs should immediately refer adults with type 2 diabetes to the local eye screening service. Perform screening as soon as possible and no later than 3 months from referral. Arrange repeat structured eye screening annually. <strong>[2009, amended 2016]</strong></p>
<p>Explain the reasons for, and success of, eye screening systems to adults with type 2 diabetes, so that attendance is not reduced by lack of knowledge or fear of outcome. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Use mydriasis with tropicamide when photographing the retina, after prior informed agreement following discussion of the advantages and disadvantages. Discussions should include precautions for driving. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Use a quality-assured digital retinal photography programme using appropriately trained staff. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Perform visual acuity testing as a routine part of eye screening programmes. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the findings, follow structured eye screening by:</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>2</sup>When prescribing pioglitazone, exercise particular caution if the person is at high risk of the adverse effects of the drug. Pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, bladder cancer and bone fracture. Known risk factors for these conditions, including increased age, should be carefully evaluated before treatment: see the manufacturers' summaries of product characteristics for details. <a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/pioglitazone-risk-of-bladder-cancer&quot; title=&quot;UK Government Web site&quot;>Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance</a> (2011) advises that 'prescribers should review the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in individuals after 3 to 6 months of treatment to ensure that only patients who are deriving benefit continue to be treated'.</p>

It advises that if the combination is used, people should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.</p>

Domperidone is now contraindicated in certain groups in whom the risk of cardiac effects is higher; its marketing authorisations have also been restricted to its use in the relief of nausea and vomiting only, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible time (usually not more than 1 week): see the MHRA guidance and summaries of product characteristics. The MHRA advises that prescribers should take into account the overall safety profile of domperidone, and in particular its cardiac risk and potential interactions with other medicines (such as erythromycin), if there is a clinical need to use it at doses or durations greater than those authorised. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. Informed consent should be obtained and documented.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most people would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of people, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') when they are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most people.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Could Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most people, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the person's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the person.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</em></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2009]</strong>. In particular, for recommendations labelled <strong>[2009]</strong>, the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence reviews used to develop the guideline recommendations were underpinned by systematic literature searches, following the methods described in 'The guidelines manual (2012)' (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The aim of the systematic searches was to comprehensively identify the published evidence to answer the review questions developed by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) and Internal Clinical Guidelines Technical Team.</p>
<p>The search strategies for the review questions were developed by the Information Services Team with advice from the Internal Clinical Guidelines Technical Team. Structured questions were developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) model and translated into search strategies using subject heading and free text terms. The strategies were run across a number of databases, date restrictions were included when requested by the Technical Team.</p>
<p>The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) were searched for economic evaluations. Search filters for economic evaluations and quality of life studies were used on bibliographic databases. Date restrictions were included when requested by the Technical Team.</p>
<p>GDG members were also asked to alert the Internal Clinical Guidelines Technical Team to any additional evidence, published, unpublished or in press, that met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>The searches were undertaken between July 2012 and June 2013. The re-run searches took place in June 2014.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Scoping Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>Scoping searches were undertaken in March 2012 using the Web sites and data bases listed in Section C.2 of Appendix C browsing or simple search strategies were employed. The search results were used to provide information for scope development and project planning.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Main Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The following sources were searched:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

<p><strong>Time-points</strong></p>
<p>The included evidence reported a variety of follow-up periods. Given the number and heterogeneity of the time-points reported in the literature, it was important to prioritise which time-points were extracted. In order to enable the comparison of studies with different follow-up periods, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) considered it important to extract outcomes at common time-points. Based on clinical practice of 3-monthly medication review and the use of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as the main indicator of glycaemic control, the GDG agreed that the following time-points would provide clinically relevant evidence and enable comparisons across all studies for the review question focusing on drug treatments to lower blood glucose levels:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>3 months (12 to 16 weeks) </li>
    <li>6 months (22 to 30 weeks) </li>
    <li>12 months (44 to 60 weeks) </li>
    <li>24 months (96 to 112 weeks) </li>
</ul>
<p>Data were extracted for each relevant time-point that was reported in the included trials. If a study reported more than 1 data-point in the time ranges outlined above, the one closest to the central figure was extracted. For example, if data were reported at 25 and 28 weeks, the data-point closest to 6 months was extracted, that is 25 weeks. If data-points were equidistant from the time-point, for example 24 and 28 weeks, the later time period, 28 weeks, was extracted. A minimum of 12 weeks' follow-up from start of treatment was agreed to be clinically relevant as it coincides with medicine reviews and HbA1c measurements.</p>
<p>For the supplementary review question on the long-term serious adverse effects of blood glucose lowering drug treatments, the GDG agreed that a minimum follow-up period of 2 years was sufficient to allow for adverse events and complications to occur.</p>
<p>For the review question on self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, the GDG agreed that a minimum follow-up period of 4 weeks would allow for important information on short-term outcomes such as hypoglycaemia to be captured.</p>
<p>No time restrictions were placed on the remaining review questions on optimal blood glucose targets, use of antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and management of erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>For dichotomous outcomes such as adverse events, data were generally extracted at study end-point.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion of Continuous Outcome Data</strong></p>
<p>Continuous outcomes which reported different units (for example, HbA1c in % or mmol/mol) were converted to a common unit prior to synthesis. Estimates of body weight in kilograms were calculated from studies which only reported body mass index (BMI). Where the mean height of the cohort was available, this was used to estimate weight; where no height data were available the mean height of people in the THIN dataset derived for the health economic model (168 cm) was used.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and a second reviewer checked the studies included in the analyses. Where numerical data were not reported in tables or text, information was extracted from graphs by digitising the images and using a bespoke electronic ruler in Microsoft Excel. Data were typically extracted from graphs where relevant time-points were not reported (for example, the study reported outcomes at 1 year but provided a graph of changes over time with data-points at 3 and 6 months) and only if measures of dispersion were provided (for example, error bars from graphs were used to estimate standard deviations).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Imputation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimating Mean Change from Baseline</strong></p>
<p>Where possible, mean difference from baseline to follow-up was the point of synthesis for continuous measures. If the study did not provide the mean difference, where possible, it was calculated from reported baseline and follow-up scores that is, follow-up score minus baseline value. However, the standard deviation (SD) of mean differences is also required for syntheses. To estimate this, it is necessary to specify the correlation between measurements at the 2 time-points. These were estimated from studies in the effectiveness evidence base. Where a study reports SD at baseline (&amp;sigma;<sub>b</sub>), SD at follow-up (&amp;sigma;<sub>f</sub>) and the SD of changes between baseline and follow-up (&amp;sigma;<sub>c</sub>), the correlation (C) between baseline and follow-up for that study may be estimated. Refer to Section 3.4.1 in the full version of the guideline for additional details and formulas for estimating correlation coefficients.</p>
<p><strong>Estimating Person Time at Risk</strong></p>
<p>When events are likely to occur to a person more than once (for example, hypoglycaemic events), it is preferable to use count or rate data. To calculate the rate of an event occurring, the total number of events and total person-time at risk are needed. However, papers did not commonly report person-time at risk.</p>
<p>Where papers reported the rate of events occurring and the total number of events, the corresponding person-time at risk was estimated. If studies provided data on specific timings of dropouts for people who withdrew from the trial, these durations were used to estimate the person-time at risk. Where these data were not reported, a crude estimate of person-time at risk for each arm in a trial was obtained from the number of participants (<em>N</em>), the duration of the trial (<em>D</em>) and the number of dropouts in the trial arm (<em>y</em>) using the formula <em>ND</em>&amp;minus;0.5<em>Dy</em>.</p>
<p>The accuracy of this crude estimation of person time at risk was tested by comparing values obtained using the equation above with values obtained using reported rates and total number of events. Although there were some differences in the values of person-time at risk, there was minimal impact on the overall rate of events.</p>
<p><strong>Approach to Missing Data</strong></p>
<p>Many of the included trials that used intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation, which is considered to overestimate treatment effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to adequately deal with this data for continuous outcomes without individual patient data reported for each study.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Crossover Trials</span></strong></p>
<p>The incorporation of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel and crossover design in single quantitative syntheses is a subject of methodological debate. The following approaches were considered:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The optimal method is to include data from crossover studies in a way that exploits the increased precision the crossover design provides. This is straightforward where within-patient differences from a paired analysis are reported by authors; alternatively, methods are available that can impute these data if the correlation between treatment periods is known (or can be calculated). </li>
    <li>Another method sometimes used is to restrict attention to the first period of randomised treatment in each crossover trial only. In this way, a parallel trial of half the size is derived. This approach is suboptimal, as it discards data from the remainder of the trial, and relies on data being reported in a way that facilitates the extraction of data from the initial period only. </li>
    <li>Another option is to exclude all crossover studies from consideration. </li>
    <li>Finally, it is possible to ignore the crossover design of the trials, and analyse them as if they had a parallel design. This method is not generally recommended, as it ignores within-patient correlations and therefore discards the design advantages of crossover trials. However, this means that the approach is conservative, as it results in the trials having less weight in syntheses than they would have if paired data were used (or imputed). </li>
</ol>
<p>The issue of washout period was discussed with the GDG and it was agreed that a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks would be adequate to minimise the influence of existing therapies. Therefore, the following decisions were taken relating to which data from crossover trials were extracted:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>If the trial reported analysis that is considered appropriate for crossover designs and a washout period of 4 to 6 weeks, then the end of treatment data were extracted. </li>
    <li>If the trial reported analysis that is considered appropriate for crossover designs but a washout period of less than 4 weeks, then data from the first treatment period only were extracted. </li>
    <li>If the trial did not report analysis that is considered appropriate for crossover designs, then data from the first treatment period only were extracted. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted to combine the results of studies for each outcome. For continuous outcomes, where change from baseline data were reported in the trials and were accompanied by a measure of spread (for example standard deviation), these were extracted and used in the meta-analysis. Where measures of spread for change from baseline values were not reported, the corresponding values at study end were used and were combined with change from baseline values to produce summary estimates of effect. These studies were assessed to ensure that baseline values were balanced across the treatment groups; if there were differences at baseline these studies were not included in any meta-analysis and were reported separately.</p>
<p><strong>Network Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>Network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted to simultaneously compare multiple treatments in a single meta-analysis, preserving the randomisation of the included trials in the reviews. This allows all evidence to be combined in a single internally consistent model.</p>
<p>An extensive series of NMAs was undertaken to synthesise evidence on pharmacological treatments to control blood glucose. The GDG's preferred approach to identifying and synthesising relevant evidence for these analyses relied on several critical assumptions that are discussed in Section 8.4.1 of the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p>Hierarchical Bayesian NMA was performed using the software WinBUGS version 1.4.3. The models were based on the approach and code provided in the NICE Decision Support Unit's Technical Support Documents on evidence synthesis, particularly Technical Support Document 2 ('A generalised linear modelling framework for pairwise and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials'; see <a href=&quot;http://www.nicedsu.org.uk/&quot; title=&quot;NICE Decision Support Unit Web site&quot;>http://www.nicedsu.org.uk/</a>). Model code is provided in Appendix K.</p>
<p>See additional details concerning the NMA in Sections 3.6.2 of the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality of evidence for the selected outcomes as specified in 'The guidelines manual (2012)'.</p>
<p><strong>GRADE for Pairwise Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the evidence base was downgraded for the reasons outlined in Table 1 of Section 3.7 of the full version of the guideline, including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Modified GRADE for Network Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>The use of GRADE to assess the quality of studies addressing a particular review question for pairwise comparisons of interventions is relatively established. However, the use of GRADE to assess the quality of evidence across a NMA is still a developing methodology. While most criteria for pairwise meta-analyses still apply, it is important to adapt some of the criteria to take into consideration additional factors, such as how each 'link' or pairwise comparison within the network applies to the others. The rationale for downgrading quality of evidence in NMA is outline in Table 2 of Section 3.7 in the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Modified GRADE for Prognostic Evidence</strong></p>
<p>GRADE has not been developed for use with prognostic studies; therefore a modified approach was applied using the framework provided for GRADE in diagnostic studies. This assessment was used for evidence in the review question on optimal target values (see Section 8.1 in the full version of the guideline).</p>
<p>Cohort studies within the non-modified GRADE approach start at the low-quality level because of accepted inherent study design limitations. Within a modified approach it is acceptable to initially indicate a high-quality level to this study type and to assess the quality of evidence from this point. The same criteria (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness) were used to downgrade the quality of evidence. Quality ratings were downgraded further for risk of bias if there was evidence of selection bias. Indirectness was assessed by examining any important differences in population, prognostic factor or outcome of the included evidence compared with those for whom the recommendation is intended. Imprecision was assessed by examining the sample size or the 95% confidence intervals around the estimate of effect. GRADE provides a guide when assessing imprecision in intervention questions (that is, where the total sample size is less than 400, the event rate is less than 300, or the 95% confidence intervals cross the thresholds for appreciable benefit or harm or the minimal important difference). The evidence was downgraded for imprecision where the 95% confidence intervals were wide or the sample size was less than 400.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="146" ordby="550" id="415" name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most people would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of people, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') when they are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most people.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most people, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the person's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the person.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2009]</strong>. In particular, for recommendations labelled<strong> [2009]</strong>, the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div>"/>

Decisions on how NICE guidance and other products apply in those countries are made by ministers in the Welsh government, Scottish government, and Northern Ireland Executive. NICE guidance or other products may include references to organisations or people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to England. </li>
    <li>This guidance represents the view of NICE, which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summaries of product characteristics of any drugs. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Key Priorities for Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>The following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p>Offer structured education to adults with type 2 diabetes and/or their family members or carers (as appropriate) at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review. Explain to people and their carers that structured education is an integral part of diabetes care. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that any structured education programme for adults with type 2 diabetes includes the following components:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>It is evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person. </li>
    <li>It has specific aims and learning objectives, and supports the person and their family members and carers in developing attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills to self-manage diabetes. </li>
    <li>It has a structured curriculum that is theory-driven, evidence-based and resource-effective, has supporting materials, and is written down. </li>
    <li>It is delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the person, and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme. </li>
    <li>It is quality assured, and reviewed by trained, competent, independent assessors who measure it against criteria that ensure consistency. </li>
    <li>The outcomes are audited regularly. <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dietary Advice</strong></p>
<p>Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight. <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blood Pressure Management</strong></p>
<p>Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg (below 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p>Monitor blood pressure every 1 to 2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140/80 mmHg (below 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). <strong>[2009]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blood Glucose Management</strong></p>
<p>Involve adults with type 2 diabetes in decisions about their individual glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target. Encourage them to achieve the target and maintain it unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or their efforts to achieve their target, impair their quality of life. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Intensify drug treatment <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The person is on insulin <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>There is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>The person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>The person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant. For more information, see the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=49120&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10691&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Diabetes in pregnancy: management of diabetes and its complications from preconception to the postnatal period</a>. <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drug Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Offer standard-release metformin as the initial drug treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. <strong>[new 2015]</strong></p>
<p>In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment<sup>1</sup> with:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>Pioglitazone<sup>2</sup> <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>A sulfonylurea <strong>[new 2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>1</sup>Be aware that, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, repaglinide is both clinically effective and cost effective in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, discuss with any person for whom repaglinide is being considered, that there is no licensed non-metformin-based combination containing repaglinide that can be offered at first intensification.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>2</sup>When prescribing pioglitazone, exercise particular caution if the person is at high risk of the adverse effects of the drug. Pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, bladder cancer and bone fracture. Known risk factors for these conditions, including increased age, should be carefully evaluated before treatment: see the manufacturers' summaries of product characteristics for details. <a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/pioglitazone-risk-of-bladder-cancer&quot; title=&quot;UK Government Web site&quot;>Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance (2011)</a> advises that 'prescribers should review the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in individuals after 3 to 6 months of treatment to ensure that only patients who are deriving benefit continue to be treated'.</p></div>"/>
