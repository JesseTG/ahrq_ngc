	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosing Gallstone Disease</strong></p>
<p>Offer liver function tests and ultrasound to people with suspected gallstone disease, and to people with abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms that have been unresponsive to previous management.</p>
<p>Consider magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) if ultrasound has not detected common bile duct stones but the:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Bile duct is dilated <strong>and/or</strong> </li>
    <li>Liver function test results are abnormal </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if MRCP does not allow a diagnosis to be made.</p>
<p>Refer people for further investigations if conditions other than gallstone disease are suspected.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Gallbladder Stones</strong></p>
<p>Reassure people with asymptomatic gallbladder stones found in a normal gallbladder and normal biliary tree that they do not need treatment unless they develop symptoms.</p>
<p>Offer laparoscopic cholecystectomy to people diagnosed with symptomatic gallbladder stones.</p>
<p>Offer day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people having it as an elective planned procedure, unless their circumstances or clinical condition make an inpatient stay necessary.</p>
<p>Offer early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (to be carried out within 1 week of diagnosis) to people with acute cholecystitis.</p>
<p>Offer percutaneous cholecystostomy to manage gallbladder empyema when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Surgery is contraindicated at presentation <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Conservative management is unsuccessful </li>
</ul>
<p>Reconsider laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people who have had percutaneous cholecystostomy once they are well enough for surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Common Bile Duct Stones</strong></p>
<p>Offer bile duct clearance and laparoscopic cholecystectomy to people with symptomatic or asymptomatic common bile duct stones.</p>
<p>Clear the bile duct:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Surgically at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>With endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before or at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy </li>
</ul>
<p>If the bile duct cannot be cleared with ERCP, use biliary stenting to achieve biliary drainage only as a temporary measure until definitive endoscopic or surgical clearance.</p>
<p>Use the lowest-cost option suitable for the clinical situation when choosing between day-case and inpatient procedures for elective ERCP.</p>
<p><strong>Patient, Family Member and Carer Information</strong></p>
<p>Advise people to avoid food and drink that triggers their symptoms until they have their gallbladder or gallstones removed.</p>
<p>Advise people that they should not need to avoid food and drink that triggered their symptoms after they have their gallbladder or gallstones removed.</p>
<p>Advise people to seek further advice from their general practitioner (GP) if eating or drinking triggers existing symptoms or causes new symptoms to develop after they have recovered from having their gallbladder or gallstones removed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</strong></p>
<p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009).</p></div>"/>

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methods for Combining Diagnostic Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy data was conducted in accordance with the process set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy.</p>
<p>A hierarchical, bivariate model was performed in R using MADA code (R Code Team 2012) to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methods for Combining Direct and Indirect Evidence (Network Meta-Analysis)</span></strong></p>
<p>Conventional 'pairwise' meta-analysis involves the statistical combination of direct evidence about pairs of interventions that originate from two or more separate studies (for example, where there are two or more studies comparing A vs B).</p>
<p>In situations where there are more than two interventions, pairwise meta-analysis of the direct evidence alone is of limited use. This is because multiple pairwise comparisons need to be performed to analyse each pair of interventions in the evidence, and these results can be difficult to interpret. Furthermore, direct evidence about interventions of interest may not be available. For example studies may compare A vs B and B vs C, but there may be no direct evidence comparing A vs C. Network meta-analysis overcomes these problems by combining all evidence into a single, internally consistent model, synthesising data from direct and indirect comparisons, and providing estimates of relative effectiveness for all comparators and the ranking of different interventions.</p>
<p>The evidence in Section 4.6 in the full version of the guideline was analysed using network meta-analysis, to inform decisions about managing common bile duct stones.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Hierarchical Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) was performed using WinBUGS version 1.4.3. The models used reflected the recommendations of the NICE Decision Support Unit's Technical Support Documents (TSDs) on evidence synthesis, particularly TSD 2 ('A generalised linear modelling framework for pairwise and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials'; see <a href=&quot;http://www.nicedsu.org.uk&quot; title=&quot;NICE Decision Support Unit Web site&quot;>http://www.nicedsu.org.uk</a>). The WinBUGS code provided in the appendices of TSD 2 was used without substantive alteration to specify synthesis models.</p>
<p>Results were reported summarising 10,000 samples from the posterior distribution of each model, having first run and discarded 50,000 'burn-in' iterations. Three separate chains with different initial values were used.</p>
<p><strong>Prior Distributions</strong></p>
<p>Non-informative prior distributions were used in all models. Trial-specific baselines and treatment effects were assigned N(0, 1000) priors, and the between-trial standard deviations used in random-effects models were given U(0, 5) priors. These are consistent with the recommendations in TSD 2 for dichotomous outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Reference Option</strong></p>
<p>To undertake an NMA, one option in the network must be specified as a common 'reference' option. The model will estimate the effects of all other options in comparison this. The choice of reference option is mathematically arbitrary; however, it may have implications for the computational efficiency of the network and/or the interpretability of outputs. For these reasons, the option that had been compared with the highest number of the other options was chosen as the reference.</p>
<p><strong>Reported Outputs</strong></p>
<p>The NMA outputs shown in this guideline (see Appendix H.7.5 in the full guideline appendices [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) are as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Network diagram, showing the availability of evidence. In these diagrams:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Node size is proportional to the total number of participants across the evidence base that were randomised to receive the treatment in question </li>
        <li>The width of connecting lines is proportional to the number of trial-level comparisons available. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Table of input data, showing the evidence used in the model. </li>
    <li>Relative effect matrix, showing an estimate of effect for each intervention compared with each of its comparators. An estimate of effect based on direct evidence only (using pairwise frequentist meta-analysis with the same fixed or random-effects models as the NMA) is also presented for comparisons where data are available. </li>
    <li>Plot of the relative effectiveness, including the results of the NMA of each intervention compared with the reference treatment (see Appendix E.2.4 in the full guideline appendices) and any direct estimate available for the same comparison. </li>
    <li>Tabulated rank probabilities, giving the probability of each treatment being best (that is, ranked #1) and its median rank with 95% credible interval (CrI). In these outputs, higher ranking always reflects what is best for the patient (for example, higher rates of disease eradication, lower rates of adverse events, higher IQ, lower blood pressure, and so on). </li>
    <li>Histograms demonstrating the probability of each treatment being at each possible rank ('rankograms') </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applying Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to Network Meta-Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The use of GRADE to assess the quality of studies addressing a particular review question for pairwise comparisons of interventions is relatively established. However, the use of GRADE to assess the quality of evidence across a network meta-analysis is still a developing methodology. While most criteria for pairwise meta-analyses still apply, it is important to adapt some of the criteria to take into consideration additional factors, such as how each 'link' or pairwise comparison within the network applies to the others. As a result, the following was used when modifying the GRADE framework to a network meta-analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the usual criteria to assess the risk of bias or 'limitations' of studies for each pairwise analysis within a network, the risk of bias was assessed for each direct comparison and assessed to see how it would affect the indirect comparisons. In addition, there was an assessment of treatment effect modifiers to see if they differed between links in the network.</p>
<p>For network meta-analyses with a large proportion of studies that were judged to be susceptible to bias, some downgrading decision rules were applied.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>If 50% or more studies in the network were inadequate or unclear for a particular parameter of quality, the outcome was downgraded by 1 level. </li>
    <li>As with pairwise meta-analyses, studies with differences in concomitant treatment between groups, or which did not report concomitant treatment between groups (where permitted), were treated with caution. Additionally, if there were differences in concomitant treatment among the studies included in different links across the network, the overall outcome was downgraded. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inconsistency</strong></p>
<p>Inconsistency was assessed for the heterogeneity of individual pairwise comparisons in the network, and also between direct and indirect comparisons where both were available (that is, where there were &quot;loops&quot; in the network).</p>
<p>Heterogeneity across studies for each direct pairwise meta-analysis was assessed using I<sup>2</sup>. This allowed for the assessment of heterogeneity within the included studies using the following decision rules:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>If there was considerable heterogeneity for 1 link or more in a network, the outcome was downgraded 1 level. </li>
    <li>If there was more than 1 link in the network with considerable, substantial or moderate heterogeneity, consideration was given to downgrading 2 levels. </li>
</ul>
<p>To assess for consistency in each pairwise comparison where both direct and indirect evidence are available, the values of the direct and indirect estimates were compared to see if they were similar.</p>
<p>The overall value of tau was also assessed to compare heterogeneity across the network.</p>
<p><strong>Indirectness</strong></p>
<p>As with pairwise meta-analyses, studies included in a network were assessed for how well they fit the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) specified in the review protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Imprecision</strong></p>
<p>Imprecision was assessed for a number of variables:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Sufficient head-to-head trials in the network. </li>
    <li>Sufficient number of studies to form the network (if there was a high proportion of 'links' formed with only 1 trial, the outcome was downgraded). </li>
    <li>Overall certainty/uncertainty of the effect estimates (size of credible intervals, including for each drug compared with the reference option, and size of credible intervals for the overall rankings within the network). </li>
    <li>For networks, imprecision was considered around both the direct and indirect effect estimates. </li>
</ul>
<p>When assessing imprecision for pairwise comparisons, or for networks with only 1 trial for all 'links' in the network, the confidence interval around the direct estimate was used (since the results were largely led by a non-informative prior).</p>

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p>NICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a scope that defines what the guideline will and will not cover.</p>
<p>This guideline was developed by the NICE Internal Clinical Guidelines Programme. The Internal Clinical Guidelines Programme worked with a Guideline Development Group, comprising healthcare professionals (including consultants, general practitioners [GPs] and nurses), patients and carers, and technical staff, which reviewed the evidence and drafted the recommendations. The recommendations were finalised after public consultation.</p>

    <field fieldid="146" ordby="550" id="415" name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</strong></p>
<p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009).</p></div>"/>
