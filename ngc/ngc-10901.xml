	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>Offer surgical management of the neck to all people with early oral cavity cancer (T1&amp;ndash;T2, N0).</p>
<p>Offer sentinel lymph node biopsy instead of elective neck dissection to people with early oral cavity cancer (T1&amp;ndash;T2, N0), unless they need cervical access at the same time (for example, free-flap reconstruction).</p>
<p><strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx (T1&amp;ndash;2, N0)</strong></p>
<p>Offer people the choice of transoral surgical resection or primary radiotherapy for T1&amp;ndash;2 N0 tumours of the oropharynx.</p>

<p><strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx</strong></p>
<p>Offer people with T3 squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx a choice of:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy, or </li>
    <li>Surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy, with or without concomitant chemotherapy </li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss the following with people with T3 squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and their carers, to inform their choice of treatment:</p>

<p>The stages of upper aerodigestive tract cancer referred to in this guideline are listed below.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>T0: this means there is no primary tumour, but there may be abnormal cells that are precancerous. </li>
    <li>T1 to T4: this refers to the increasing size and/or extent of the primary tumour, with 1 being smallest and 4 largest. </li>
    <li>N0: no lymph nodes contain cancer cells. </li>
    <li>N1 and upwards: increasing involvement of lymph nodes by cancer cells. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Committee (GC) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GC is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GC usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GC uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The GC uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GC uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') when confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Could Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GC uses 'consider' when the GC is confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer (NCC-C) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Developing Clinical Evidence-Based Questions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Clinical guidelines should be aimed at changing clinical practice and should avoid ending up as 'evidence-based textbooks' or making recommendations on topics where there is already agreed clinical practice. Therefore the list of key clinical issues listed in the scope were developed for areas that were known to be controversial or uncertain, where there was identifiable practice variation, or where NICE guidelines were likely to have most impact.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>From each of the key clinical issues identified in the scope, the Guideline Committee (GC) formulated a clinical question. For clinical questions about interventions, the PICO framework was used. This structured approach divides each question into four components: P &amp;ndash; the population (the population under study); I &amp;ndash; the interventions (what is being done); C &amp;ndash; the comparison (other main treatment options); O &amp;ndash; the outcomes (the measures of how effective the interventions have been).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Review of Clinical Literature </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Scoping Search</strong></p>
<p>An initial scoping search for published guidelines, systematic reviews, economic evaluations and ongoing research was carried out on the following databases or Web sites: National Health Service (NHS) Evidence, NICE, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), TRIP (Turning Research into Practice), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHSEED), Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED), Medline and EMBASE.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the development phase, initial scoping searches were carried out to identify any relevant guidelines (local, national or international) produced by other groups or institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Developing the Review Protocol</strong></p>
<p>For each clinical question, the information specialist and researcher (with input from other technical team and GC members) prepared a review protocol. This protocol explains how the review was to be carried out (see Table 1 in the full version of the guideline) in order to develop a plan of how to review the evidence, limit the introduction of bias and for the purposes of reproducibility. All review protocols can be found in the evidence review (see Appendix H).</p>
<p><strong>Searching for the Evidence </strong></p>
<p>In order to answer each question the NCC-C information specialist developed a search strategy to identify relevant published evidence for both clinical and cost effectiveness. Key words and terms for the search were agreed in collaboration with the GC.</p>
<p>Search filters, such as those to identify systematic reviews (SRs) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were applied to the search strategies when necessary. No language restrictions were applied to the search; however, foreign language papers were not requested or reviewed (unless of particular importance to that question).</p>
<p>The following databases were included in the literature search:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Cochrane Library </li>
    <li>Medline and Premedline 1946 onwards </li>
    <li>Excerpta Medica (EMBASE) 1974 onwards </li>
    <li>Web of Science (specifically Science Citation Index Expanded [SCI-Expanded] 1900 onwards, Social Sciences Citation Index [SSCI] 1900 onwards and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science [CPCI-S] 1990-present </li>
</ul>
<p>Subject specific databases used for certain topics:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) 1937 onwards </li>
    <li>PsycINFO 1806 onwards </li>
</ul>
<p>From this list the information specialist sifted and removed any irrelevant material based on the title or abstract before passing to the researcher. All the remaining articles were then stored in a Reference Manager electronic library.</p>
<p>Searches were updated and re-run 6 to 8 weeks before the guideline was submitted to NICE for stakeholder consultation, thereby ensuring that the latest relevant published evidence was included in the database. Any evidence published after this date was not included. For the purposes of updating this guideline, June 2015 should be considered the starting point for searching for new evidence.</p>
<p>Further details of the search strategies, including the methodological filters used, are provided in the evidence review.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>Following the literature search one researcher independently scanned the titles and abstracts of every article for each question, and full publications were obtained for any studies considered relevant or where there was insufficient information from the title and abstract to make a decision. When papers were obtained the researcher applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select appropriate studies, which were then critically appraised. If results from a study were published as more than one paper, the most recent or complete publication was used.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Incorporating Health Economics Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The aim of providing economic input into the development of the guideline was to inform the GC of potential economic issues relating to upper aerodigestive tract cancer. Health economics is about improving the health of the population through the efficient use of resources. In addition to assessing clinical effectiveness, it is important to investigate whether health services are being used in a cost effective manner in order to maximise health gain from available resources.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritising Topics for Economic Analysis</strong></p>
<p>After the clinical questions had been defined, and with the help of the health economist, the GC discussed and agreed which of the clinical questions were potential priorities for economic analysis. These economic priorities were chosen on the basis of the following criteria, in broad accordance with the NICE guidelines manual (NICE 2012) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field):</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The overall importance of the recommendation, which may be a function of the number of patients affected and the potential impact on costs and health outcomes per patient </li>
    <li>The current extent of uncertainty over cost effectiveness, and the likelihood that economic analysis will reduce this uncertainty </li>
    <li>The feasibility of building an economic model </li>
</ul>
<p>A review of the economic literature was conducted at scoping. Where published economic evaluation studies were identified that addressed the economic issues for a clinical question, these are presented alongside the clinical evidence.</p>
<p>For systematic searches of published economic evidence, the following databases were included:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Medline </li>
    <li>EMBASE </li>
    <li>NHS EED </li>
    <li>HTA </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Review of the Clinical Literature</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Critical Appraisal and Evidence Grading</strong></p>
<p>For each question, data were extracted on the outcomes identified as critical or important by the Guideline Committee (GC) and recorded in evidence tables and an accompanying evidence summary prepared for the GC. All evidence was considered carefully by the GC for accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)</strong></p>
<p>For interventional questions, studies which matched the inclusion criteria were evaluated and presented using GRADE (NICE 2012; <a href=&quot;http://gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Working Group Web site&quot;>http://gradeworkinggroup.org/</a>). Where possible this included meta-analysis and synthesis of data into a GRADE 'evidence profile'. The evidence profile shows, for each outcome, an overall assessment of both the quality of the evidence as a whole (very low, low, moderate or high) as well as an estimate of the size of effect. A narrative summary (evidence statement) was also prepared.</p>
<p>Each outcome was examined for the quality elements defined in Table 2 in the full version of the guideline and subsequently graded using the quality levels listed in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field. The reasons for downgrading or upgrading specific outcomes were explained in footnotes.</p>
<p>All procedures were fully compliant with NICE methodology as detailed in the 'NICE guidelines manual' (NICE 2012) (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). In general, evidence was based on published data only. Study authors were contacted only to resolve any ambiguities, such as unclear presentation of data, or where clarification was needed in order to include or exclude a paper in the evidence review.</p>
<p>For non-interventional questions, for example questions regarding diagnostic test accuracy, a narrative summary of the quality of the evidence was provided. The quality of individual diagnostic accuracy studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.</p>

<p>The aim of reviewing and appraising the existing economic literature is to identify relevant economic evaluations that compare both costs and health consequences of alternative interventions and that are applicable to National Health Service (NHS) practice. Thus studies that only report costs, non-comparative studies of 'cost of illness' studies are generally excluded from the reviews.</p>
<p>Economic studies identified through a systematic search of the literature are appraised using a methodology checklist designed for economic evaluations. This checklist is not intended to judge the quality of a study per se, but to determine whether an existing economic evaluation is useful to inform the decision-making of the GC for a specific topic within the guideline. There are two parts of the appraisal process; the first step is to assess applicability (i.e., the relevance of the study to the specific guideline topic and the NICE reference case) (see Table 4 in the full version of the guideline for applicability criteria).</p>
<p>In the second step, only those studies deemed directly or partially applicable are further assessed for limitations (i.e., the methodological quality, see Table 5 in the full version of the guideline).</p>
<p>Where relevant, a summary of the main findings from the systematic search, review and appraisal of economic evidence is presented in an economic evidence profile alongside the clinical evidence.</p>
<p>If high-quality published economic evidence relevant to current NHS practice was identified through the search, the existing literature was reviewed and appraised as described above. However, it is often the case that published economic studies may not be directly relevant to the specific clinical question as defined in the guideline or may not be comprehensive or conclusive enough to inform UK practice. In such cases, for priority topics, consideration was given to undertaking a new economic analysis as part of this guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Modelling</strong></p>
<p>Once the need for a new economic analysis for high priority topics had been agreed by the GC, the health economist investigated the feasibility of developing an economic model. In the development of the analysis, the following general principles were adhered to:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The GC subgroup was consulted during the construction and interpretation of the analysis </li>
    <li>The analysis was based on the best available clinical evidence from the systematic review </li>
    <li>Assumptions were reported fully and transparently </li>
    <li>Uncertainty was explored through sensitivity analysis </li>
    <li>Costs were calculated from a health services perspective </li>
    <li>Outcomes were reported in terms of quality-adjusted life years </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Guideline Development Process &amp;ndash; Who Develops the Guideline?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The development of this guideline was based upon methods outlined in the 'NICE guidelines manual' (NICE 2012 and NICE 2014 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). A team of health professionals, lay representatives and technical experts known as the Guideline Committee (GC) (see Appendix G), with support from the NCC-C staff, undertook the development of this clinical guideline. The basic steps in the process of developing a guideline are listed below:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Using the remit, define the scope which sets the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the guideline </li>
    <li>Forming the GC </li>
    <li>Developing clinical questions </li>
    <li>Identifying the health economic priorities </li>
    <li>Developing the review protocols </li>
    <li>Systematically searching for the evidence </li>
    <li>Critically appraising the evidence </li>
    <li>Incorporating health economic evidence </li>
    <li>Distilling and synthesising the evidence and writing recommendations </li>
    <li>Agreeing the recommendations </li>
    <li>Structuring and writing the guideline </li>
    <li>Consultation and validation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Scope</strong></p>
<p>The scope was drafted by the GC Chair and Lead Clinician and staff at the NCC-C in accordance with processes established by NICE (NICE 2012). The purpose of the scope was to:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Set the boundaries of the development work and provide a clear framework to enable work to stay within the priorities agreed by NICE and the NCC-C </li>
    <li>Inform professionals and the public about the expected content of the guideline </li>
    <li>Provide an overview of the population and healthcare settings the guideline would include and exclude </li>
    <li>Specify the key clinical issues that will be covered by the guideline </li>
    <li>Inform the development of the clinical questions and search strategies </li>
</ul>
<p>Before the guideline development process started, the draft scope was presented and discussed at a stakeholder workshop. The list of key clinical issues were discussed and revised before the formal consultation process. Further details of the discussion at the stakeholder workshop can be found on the <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>NICE Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The scope was subject to a four-week stakeholder consultation in accordance with NICE processes. The full scope is shown in Appendix F. During the consultation period, the scope was posted on the NICE Web site. Comments were invited from registered stakeholder organisations and NICE staff. The NCC-C and NICE reviewed the scope in light of comments received, and the revised scope was reviewed and signed off by NICE and posted on the NICE Web site.</p>
<p><strong>The Guideline Committee (GC)</strong></p>
<p>The upper aerodigestive tract cancer GC was recruited in line with the 'NICE guidelines manual' (NICE 2012). The first step was to appoint a Chair and a Lead Clinician. Advertisements were placed for both posts and shortlisted candidates were interviewed in person prior to being offered the role. The NCC-C Director, GC Chair and Lead Clinician identified a list of specialties that needed to be represented on the GC. Details of the adverts were sent to the main stakeholder organisations, cancer networks and patient organisations/charities (see Appendix G). Individual GC members were selected for telephone interview by the NCC-C Director, GC Chair and Lead Clinician, based on their application forms. The guideline development process was supported by staff from the NCC-C, who undertook the clinical and health economics literature searches, reviewed and presented the evidence to the GC, and managed the process and contributed to drafting the guideline.</p>
<p><em>Guideline Committee Meetings</em></p>
<p>Thirteen GC meetings were held between 16&amp;ndash;17 Dec 2013 and 2&amp;ndash;3 Nov 2015. During each GC meeting (held over either one or two days) clinical questions and clinical and economic evidence were reviewed, assessed and recommendations formulated. At each meeting patient/carer and service-user concerns were routinely discussed as part of a standing agenda item.</p>
<p>NCC-C project managers divided the GC workload by allocating specific clinical questions, relevant to their area of clinical practice, to small sub-groups of the GC in order to simplify and speed up the guideline development process. These groups considered the evidence, as reviewed by the researcher, and synthesised it into draft recommendations before presenting it to the GC. These recommendations were then discussed and agreed by the GC as a whole. Each clinical question was led by a GC member with expert knowledge of the clinical area (usually one of the healthcare professionals). The GC subgroups often helped refine the clinical questions and the clinical definitions of treatments. They also assisted the NCC-C team in drafting the section of the guideline relevant to their specific topic.</p>
<p><em>Patient/Carer Representatives</em></p>
<p>Individuals with direct experience of upper aerodigestive tract cancer services gave an important user focus to the GC and the guideline development process. The GC included two patient/carer members. They contributed as full GC members to writing the clinical questions, helping to ensure that the evidence addressed their views and preferences, highlighting sensitive issues and terminology relevant to the guideline and bringing service-user research to the attention of the GC.</p>
<p><em>Expert Advisers</em></p>
<p>During the development of the guideline the GC identified shoulder rehabilitation following neck dissection as a topic that required additional expert input. One expert was identified by the NCC-C and GC (see Appendix G) and invited to advise the GC on drafting their recommendations for that clinical question.</p>
<p><strong>Agreeing the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>For each clinical question the GC were presented with a summary of the clinical evidence, and, where appropriate, economic evidence, derived from the studies reviewed and appraised. The GC derived their guideline recommendations from this information. The link between the evidence and the view of the GC in making each recommendation is made explicitly in the accompanying Linking Evidence to Recommendations (LETR) statement (see below).</p>
<p><em>Wording of the Recommendations</em></p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendations were made. Some recommendations were made with more certainty than others. Recommendations are based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, whilst taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence.</p>
<p>For all recommendations, it is expected that a discussion will take place with the patients about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion should help the patient reach a fully informed decision. Terms used within this guideline are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>'Offer' &amp;ndash; for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm </li>
    <li>'Do not offer' &amp;ndash; the intervention will not be of benefit for most patients </li>
    <li>'Consider' &amp;ndash; the benefit is less certain, and an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for an 'offer' recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>LETR Statements</em></p>
<p>As clinical guidelines were previously formatted, there was limited scope for expressing how and why a GC made a particular recommendation from the evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness. To make this process more transparent to the reader, NICE have introduced an explicit, easily understood and consistent way of expressing the reasons for making each recommendation. This is known as the 'LETR statement' and will usually cover the following key points:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value placed on the outcomes considered </li>
    <li>The strength of evidence about benefits and harms for the intervention being considered </li>
    <li>The costs and cost effectiveness of an intervention </li>
    <li>The quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>The degree of consensus within the GC </li>
    <li>Other considerations &amp;ndash; for example equalities issues </li>
</ul>
<p>Where evidence was weak or lacking the GC agreed the final recommendations through informal consensus. Shortly before the consultation period five key research recommendations were selected by the GC for implementation and the patient algorithms were agreed.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="146" ordby="550" id="415" name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Committee (GC) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GC is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GC usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GC uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GC is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GC uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>"/>

<p>The draft of the guideline was prepared by National Collaborating Centre for Cancer (NCC-C) staff in partnership with the Guideline Committee (GC) Chair and Lead Clinician. This was then discussed and agreed with the GC and subsequently forwarded to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for consultation with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Registered stakeholders (see Appendix G of the full version of the guideline [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) had one opportunity to comment on the draft guideline which was posted on the NICE Web site between 3 September 2015 and 15 October 2015 in line with NICE methodology.</p>
<p><strong>The Pre-Publication Process</strong></p>
<p>An embargoed pre-publication version of the guideline was released to registered stakeholders who have signed a confidentiality form to allow them to see how their comments have contributed to the development of the guideline and to give them time to prepare for publication. The final document was then submitted to NICE for publication on their Web site. The other versions of the guideline were also discussed and approved by the GC and published at the same time.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The recommendations made for information and support may potentially lead to information overload for some patients, which may lead to increased anxiety if the information is not tailored to the individual. </li>
    <li>The Guideline Committee (GC) considered the potential harms of diagnostic imaging recommendations to be additional exposure to low-dose radiation in some patients, as a result of cross-sectional imaging. </li>
    <li>There is debate about which imaging tests usually used for systemic staging are most accurate. There are potential harms associated with these imaging tests including radiation exposure and the discovery of incidental problems which may complicate care. </li>
    <li>A proportion of negative sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs) would be false negative (approximately 5%). These patients may require therapeutic neck dissection and may have a poorer outcome than if they had received an initial elective neck dissection. The GC believed that the benefit of less treatment significantly outweighs this small risk. </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy and radiotherapy-associated morbidities were considered to be potential harms of the recommendations that have been made. </li>
    <li>Anticipated harms of recommendations for interventions for people at risk for airway obstruction are:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The need for some patients to undergo multiple debulking procedures (as opposed to a single tracheostomy) </li>
        <li>In those patients with potential airways obstruction there is the potential increased patient anxiety from discussing planned treatment, which may not subsequently be needed. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Additional chemotherapy is likely to be associated with additional toxicity. </li>
    <li>Increased treatment-related morbidity from radiotherapy was identified as a potential harm of the treatment recommendations. </li>
    <li>Potential harms associated with enteral feeding include procedure-related morbidity/mortality, skin excoriation and the psychosocial impact. Screening and assessment of patients by a dietitian from the multidisciplinary team (for suitability of the type of feeding tube and method of insertion) would help minimise these harms. </li>
    <li>No harms of progressive resistance training (PRT) were identified, providing exercises are followed correctly (exercises performed incorrectly could result in harm). </li>
    <li>The main perceived harm of recommendations for structured follow-up was a greater burden for patients due to more frequent appointments, and therefore more travel, more anxiety associated with appointments and awaiting test results, and from any false positive test results. </li>

    <li>Healthcare professionals are expected to take National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of each patient, in consultation with the patient and/or their guardian or carer. </li>
    <li>The Guideline Committee (GC) assumes that healthcare professionals will use clinical judgement, knowledge and expertise when deciding whether it is appropriate to apply these guidelines. The recommendations cited here are a guide and may not be appropriate for use in all situations.

    <li>It has been impossible to cover every aspect of the patient pathway but instead the GC has concentrated on those areas where it was felt uncertainty or variation in practice currently exists.
