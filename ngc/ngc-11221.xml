	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot;>
    <li>Perioperative team members should provide care that respects the dignity and privacy of each patient during patient positioning (Standards of perioperative nursing, 2017). </li>
    <li>The perioperative registered nurse (RN) should conduct a preoperative patient assessment to identify patients at risk for positioning injury, develop a plan of care, and implement interventions to prevent injury. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should identify and provide the positioning equipment and devices required for the operative or invasive procedure (Fletcher, 2014; Penprase &amp;amp; Johnson, 2014; Dybec, 2004). </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should select, clean, inspect, and maintain positioning equipment, devices, and support surfaces and should ensure they are repaired or replaced when damaged, defective, or obsolete (Chitlik, 2011; Patient positioning, 2011). </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should use operating room (OR) beds, positioning equipment and devices, and support surfaces correctly (Patient positioning, 2011). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should identify potential hazards associated with positioning activities and should establish safe practices. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should position patients on surfaces that reduce the potential for pressure injury. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe positioning practices. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the supine or modifications of the supine position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the Trendelenburg or modifications of the Trendelenburg position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the reverse Trendelenburg or modifications of the reverse Trendelenburg position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the lithotomy or modifications of the lithotomy position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the sitting or semi-sitting or modifications of the sitting or semi-sitting position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the lateral or modifications of the lateral position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the prone or modifications of the prone position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement measures to reduce the risk for injuries when positioning patients who are pregnant. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement measures to reduce the risk for injuries when positioning patients who are obese. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should collaborate with the perianesthesia RN to identify patient injury caused by intraoperative positioning (Fletcher, 2014). </li>
    <li>The health care organization should maintain records of patient care related to patient positioning and organizational processes related to positioning equipment and devices. </li>
    <li>Personnel with responsibility for positioning patients should receive initial and ongoing education and complete competency verification activities related to patient positioning. </li>
    <li>The health care organization should develop policies and procedures for positioning the patient, revise them as necessary, and make them readily available in the practice setting in which they are used. </li>
    <li>The health care organization's quality management program should evaluate patient positioning. </li>

Results from these alerts were provided to the lead author until September 2016. The lead author requested a supplementary search on eye protection and requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. The lead author and the medical librarian also identified relevant guidelines from government agencies, professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Search terms included <em>positioning, positioning injury, compression injury, shear, friction, pressure, interface pressure, pressure ulcers, pressure reducing, pressure relieving, positioning surfaces, support surfaces, positioning equipment, positioning devices, safety straps, OR table, OR bed, OR mattress, alternating pressure mattresses, procedure table, padding, foam, gel, viscoelastic, supine, Fowler/Semi-Fowler/beach chair, lithotomy, lateral, prone, Trendelenburg/reverse Trendelenburg, jack-knife/Kraske, </em>and<em> robotic</em>. Other subject headings and keywords were included to address specific positioning devices, alternative terms for positions, patient-monitoring indicators, and risk assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available. Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and literature on surgical smoke safety. Letters and editorials were excluded.
