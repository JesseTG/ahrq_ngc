	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Evaluation</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend that assessments with either the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (combined with assessment of pupils) or the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) score be routinely performed in comatose adult patients with acute brain injury (ABI). (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0&amp;ndash;10 to elicit patient's self-report of pain in all neurocritical care patients wakeful enough to attempt this. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend in the absence of a reliable NRS patient self-report, clinicians use a behavior-based scale to estimate patient pain such as the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) or Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CCPOT). (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend use of the revised Nociception Coma Scale (NCS-R) to estimate pain for patients with severely impaired consciousness such as vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS), using a threshold score of 4. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend monitoring sedation with a validated and reliable scale such as the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) or Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend against performing sedation interruption or wake-up tests among brain-injured patients with intracranial hypertension, unless benefit outweighs the risk. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest assessment of delirium among neurocritical care patients include a search for new neurologic insults as well as using standard delirium assessment tools. (<em>Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend attention to level of wakefulness, as used in the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), during delirium screening to avoid confounding due to residual sedative effect. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systemic Hemodynamics</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend the use of electrocardiography and invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure in all unstable or at-risk patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). (<em>Strong Recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that hemodynamic monitoring be used to establish goals that take into account cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygenation. These goals vary depending on diagnosis and disease stage. (<em>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend the use of additional hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., intravascular volume assessment, echocardiography, cardiac output monitors) in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. (<em>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that the choice of technique for assessing pre-load, after-load, cardiac output, and global systemic perfusion should be guided by specific evidence and local expertise. (<em>Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring are recommended as a part of protocol-driven care in patients who are at risk of elevated intracranial pressure based on clinical and/or imaging features. (<em>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that ICP and CPP monitoring be used to guide medical and surgical interventions and to detect life-threatening imminent herniation; however, the threshold value of ICP is uncertain on the basis of the literature. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that the indications and method for ICP monitoring should be tailored to the specific diagnosis (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH], traumatic brain injury [TBI], encephalitis). (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>While other intracranial monitors can provide useful information, the authors recommend that ICP monitoring be used as a prerequisite to allow interpretation of data provided by these other devices. (<em>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend the use of standard insertion and maintenance protocols to ensure safety and reliability of the ICP monitoring procedure. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>Both parenchymal ICP monitors and external ventricular catheters (EVD) provide reliable and accurate data and are the recommended devices to measure ICP. In the presence of hydrocephalus, use of an EVD when safe and practical is preferred to parenchymal monitoring. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend the continuous assessment and monitoring of ICP and CPP including waveform quality using a structured protocol to ensure accuracy and reliability. Instantaneous ICP values should be interpreted in the context of monitoring trends, CPP, and clinical evaluation. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>While refractory ICP elevation is a strong predictor of mortality, ICP per se does not provide a useful prognostic marker of functional outcome; therefore, the authors recommend that ICP not be used in isolation as a prognostic marker. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cerebral Autoregulation</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest that monitoring and assessment of autoregulation may be useful in broad targeting of cerebral perfusion management goals and prognostication in ABI. (<em>Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>Continuous bedside monitoring of autoregulation is now feasible, and the authors suggest that it should be considered as a part of multimodality monitoring (MMM). Measurement of pressure reactivity has been commonly used for this purpose, but many different approaches may be equally valid. (<em>Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systemic and Brain Oxygenation</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend systemic pulse oximetry in all patients and end-tidal capnography in mechanically ventilated patients, supported by arterial blood gases measurement. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend monitoring brain oxygen in patients with or at risk of cerebral ischemia and/or hypoxia, using brain tissue (PbtO<sub>2</sub>) or/and jugular venous bulb oximetry (SjvO<sub>2</sub>)&amp;mdash;the choice of which depends on patient pathology. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that the location of the PbtO<sub>2</sub> probe and side of jugular venous oximetry depend on the diagnosis, the type and location of brain lesions, and technical feasibility. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>While persistently low PbtO<sub>2</sub> and/or repeated episodes of jugular venous desaturation are strong predictors of mortality and unfavorable outcome, the authors recommend that brain oxygen monitors be used with clinical indicators and other monitoring modalities for accurate prognostication. (<em>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest the use of brain oxygen monitoring to assist titration of medical and surgical therapies to guide ICP/CPP therapy, identify refractory intracranial hypertension and treatment thresholds, help manage delayed cerebral ischemia, and select patients for second-tier therapy. (<em>Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cerebral Blood Flow</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) or transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) monitoring to predict angiographic vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. (<em>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that trends of TCD or TCCS can help predict delayed ischemic neurological deficits due to vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. (<em>Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that TCCS is superior to TCD in the detection of angiographically proven vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. (<em>Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that TCD or TCCS monitoring can help predict vasospasm after traumatic SAH. (<em>Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that a thermal diffusion flowmetry (TDF) probe may be used to identify patients with focal ischemic risk within the vascular territory of the probe. (<em>Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>) </li>
    <li>The authors suggest use of a TCD screening paradigm using Lindegaard ratios or comparisons of bi-hemispheric middle cerebral artery mean velocities to improve sensitivity for identification of vasospasm-associated ischemic damage.

    <li>&quot;Wake-up tests&quot; in patients with unstable intracranial hypertension pose significant risks and often may lead to physiological decompensation, and show no proven benefits in terms of in duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, or mortality. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The intent of this consensus statement is to assist clinicians in decision-making. However, the authors recognize that this information must be targeted to the specific clinical situation in individual patients on the basis of clinical judgment and resource availability. The authors therefore recognize that, while the recommendations provide useful guidance, they cannot be seen as mandatory for all individual clinician-patient interactions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Caveats and Limitations to the Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The setting of these recommendations, monitoring, makes it difficult to use all of the normal considerations used to make decisions about the strength of recommendations, typically of a treatment, which include the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, estimates of effect based on direct evidence, and resource use since monitoring has no proximate effects on outcome. Instead it typically modifies treatment and can only influence outcome through such modulation. The guideline authors' confidence in the estimate of effects in most analyses was not derived from methodologically rigorous studies, because few such studies exist, but often driven by epidemiological studies and investigations of clinical physiology, which usually provided indirect evidence, with several potential confounders.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, decisions on recommendations are driven by an expectation of values and preferences. Given the limited outcome data of both benefit and harm associated with neuromonitoring, the authors relied on inferences from observational studies and extrapolation from pathophysiology to estimate the effect and effect size of potential benefit and harm. The authors concluded that the avoidance of permanent neurological deficit would be the dominant driver of patient choice. Given that the diseases and disease mechanisms caregivers monitor are known to be damaging, and given that the time available for intervention is limited, the authors made these extrapolations unless there was real concern about benefit or evidence of harm. This approach to deciding on recommendations was universally adopted by all members of the multispecialty, multidisciplinary, multinational panel. Though there was some variation in initial opinions, careful consideration of the available evidence and options resulted in relatively tightly agreed consensus on recommendations.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Each author and each member of the jury reported any potential conflicts of interest (COI). The author and Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) Guideline Committee Chairs determined any required resolutions according to NCS COI process and resolution guidelines before appointment to the writing committee. The following methods were used to resolve any potential COI: (1) Perform peer review for evidence-based content, (2) provide faculty with alternate topic, (3) provide alternate faculty for specific topics, (4) limit content to evidence with no recommendations, (5) perform review of all materials associated with the activity by planning committee, (6) abstain from discussions related to the conflict, (7) abstain from voting related to the conflict, (8) request reassignment to a committee that will not result in a conflict. NCS Guidelines state: &quot;The chair or co-chairs cannot have any financial or other important conflicts of interest related to the guideline topic.&quot; Peter Le Roux proposed the subject and initiated the project and therefore was appointed chair by the NCS. To be compliant with NCS Guidelines he did not vote on any of the recommendations that followed jury deliberations because of potential COI associated with industry relationships.</p>
