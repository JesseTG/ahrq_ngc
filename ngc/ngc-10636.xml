      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnostic Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend that brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and hemosiderin-sensitive sequences should be performed to: (a) investigate patients with brain masses accompanied by vasogenic oedema and substantial amounts of blood, (b) diagnose cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) and (c) determine whether CCM are solitary or multiple. Reference should be made to CCM diagnostic criteria and definitions and reporting standards for CCM hemorrhage (Rigamonti et al., 1987; Al-Shahi Salman et al., 2008).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Therapeutic Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How Should an Adult with an Incidentally Discovered CCM Be Managed?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend that decisions about the treatment of adults with incidentally-discovered CCM be made on a case-by-case basis, given the absence of randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects specific to these adults.</p>
<p><strong>How Should an Adult with a CCM That Has Caused One Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) or Focal Neurological Deficit (FND) Be Managed?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend that decisions about the treatment of adults with CCM that have already caused one ICH or FND be made on a case-by-case basis, given the absence of randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects specific to these adults.</p>
<p><strong>How Should an Adult with a CCM That Has Caused More Than One ICH or FND Be Managed?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend that decisions about the treatment of adults with CCM that have caused more than one ICH or FND be made on a case-by-case basis, given the absence of randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects specific to these adults.</p>
<p><strong>How Should an Adult with a CCM That Has Caused Epileptic Seizure(s) Be Managed?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend adherence to existing guidelines for the management of first seizures and epilepsy in general (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN], 2005; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2012), given the absence of randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects for adults with a CCM that has caused a first seizure or epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>How Should CCM Be Managed in Mothers Before, During, and After Birth?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend that decisions about the treatment of mothers with CCM be made on a case-by-case basis, given the absence of randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects specific to these women.</p>
<p><strong>Should the Existence of a CCM Influence the Prescription of Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medications?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors recommend that decisions about antithrombotic or thrombolytic treatment of adults with CCM be made on a case-by-case basis, given the absence of randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects specific to these adults. The authors recommend that clinicians bear in mind the beneficial effects of antithrombotic and thrombolytic drugs shown for some vaso-occlusive diseases in randomized controlled trials, which will have included some adults with CCM.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Genetic Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Likelihood of Finding a Mutation in the CCM1, CCM2 or CCM3 Genes?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors do not recommend mutation analysis in the CCM 1, 2, and 3 genes for adults without a family history and only one CCM on hemosiderin-sensitive brain MRI sequences. They recommend that mutation analysis be considered by adults with CCM(s) and a family history of CCM, and by adults with multiple CCM and no family history.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which Professional Groups Should Manage Adults with CCMs?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors were unable to find guidelines on which professional groups should manage adults with CCMs. However, the authors recommend that any adult with a CCM should be seen by a neurologist or neurosurgeon with a vascular sub-specialty interest who can advise on the treatment of CCMs. Any adult with a CCM causing one or more epileptic seizures should be seen by an appropriate specialist, in keeping with epilepsy management guidelines (SIGN, 2005; NICE, 2012). Adults concerned about pre-symptomatic genetic testing should see a clinical geneticist prior to any testing being undertaken.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Identification of Questions</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors formulated specific management questions by consensus, using the PICO principle by specifying for each question: Patients (i.e., adults with cerebral cavernous malformations [CCM]), Intervention/Indicator, Comparator/Control, and the Outcome of interest. They identified important outcomes in discussion with the two patient support groups involved with the creation of these guidelines. They judged the relative importance of the outcomes, and prioritized death and new or worsened clinically symptomatic focal neurological deficits (FNDs) (whether or not new intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH] had been confirmed by imaging or pathological examination).</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors used electronic strategies (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document) to search for journal articles about CCM published prior to 1 January 2011 and indexed in OVID Medline and EMBASE. Pairs of the group of three reviewers reviewed the titles and abstracts of eligible articles and excluded articles if: they were reviews and did not report original data, they did not address the specific management questions, they were exclusive to children with CCM, they reported fewer than 20 adults with CCM, the guideline authors were unable to extract relevant data from the article, or they were not designed to address the specific PICO questions (see Appendix 2 in the original guideline for the list of excluded studies and the reasons for their exclusion). If there were disagreements or uncertainties amongst the pair of reviewers, they were arbitrated by a third reviewer.</p>
<p>For diagnostic guidelines the search was limited to studies testing the accuracy of CCM diagnostic criteria applied to a consecutive series using a pathological reference standard and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the index test.</p>
<p>For therapeutic guidelines the search was limited to studies of CCM treatment involving at least 20 adults that examined surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery, in which a group of adults receiving treatment was compared to either another group receiving a different treatment or to a conservatively-managed (untreated) group of adults. The guideline authors have stratified their specific management questions by adults' mode of clinical presentation because the future risks of hemorrhage from CCM may be higher if the CCM initially comes to medical attention with a hemorrhage (see Section 1.5 and Figure 2 in the original guideline document). The guideline authors sought to further stratify the answers to specific management questions by CCM location (because it too may influence the future risk of hemorrhage), and to distinguish outcomes for adults with solitary or multiple CCM.</p>
<p>For genetic guidelines the guideline authors sought studies of the frequency of genetic mutations or deletions in the CCM 1, 2, and 3 genes in three groups of adults with CCM: (1) adult with a single CCM but no family history, (2) adult with at least one CCM and a family history, and (3) adult with multiple CCMs but no family history. Papers included had completed analysis of at least one entire gene by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mutation detection strategy, with or without deletion analysis by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).

<p><strong>Grading the Quality of the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Pairs of the group of three reviewers independently graded the quality of evidence available in each of the articles pertinent to diagnostic and therapeutic questions using the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) Levels of Evidence published in 2011 (<a href=&quot;http://www.cebm.net/ocebm-levels-of-evidence/&quot; title=&quot;Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Web site&quot;>http://www.cebm.net/ocebm-levels-of-evidence/</a>). For studies of diagnostic test accuracy, the guideline authors sought studies graded as Level 1 (systematic review of cross sectional studies with a consistently applied reference standard and blinding) or Level 2 (individual cross sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding). For studies of the benefits and harms of treatments, the authors sought studies graded as Level 1 (systematic review of randomized trials or n-of-1 trials) or Level 2 (randomized trial or observational study with dramatic effect). The guideline authors used a published definition of a dramatic effect in an observational treatment study, &quot;a sufficiently extreme difference between the outcome ranges for treated and untreated patients might be defined by two rules: (a) that the conventionally calculated probability of the two groups of observations coming from the same population should be less than 0.01 and (b) that the estimate of the treatment effect (rate ratio) should be large&amp;hellip; The guideline authors suggest that rate ratios beyond 10 are highly likely to reflect real treatment effects, even if confounding factors associated with the treatment may have contributed to the size of the observed associations.&quot; If there appeared to be a dramatic effect in an observational treatment study the guideline authors also judged whether the risk of bias in the study was high, and if it was the article was excluded (see Appendix 2 in the original guideline document). Three reviewers agreed on the overall quality of the evidence relevant to each Patient, Intervention/Indicator, Comparator/Control, and Outcome (PICO) question which was available after this selection process, and other members of the guidelines panel approved the final grading.</p>
<p>Two reviewers independently reviewed a selection of the articles that were identified as being potentially relevant to the genetic questions in these guidelines from the literature search (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document). In the absence of CEBM criteria for grading the quality of the evidence in genetic testing studies, the reviewers identified articles that they thought best answered these questions.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Grading the Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>After considering the grade of the quality of the evidence available for each Patient, Intervention/Indicator, Comparator/Control, and Outcome (PICO) question described in a document circulated electronically, the guidelines panel incorporated their judgments about the underlying values and preferences related to the management options and outcomes, the balance of desirable and undesirable effects, and the balance of net benefits and cost, culminating in a recommendation. In a consensus discussion, the guidelines panel felt unable to grade the strength of their recommendations in the light of the quality of the evidence available.</p></div>"/>
