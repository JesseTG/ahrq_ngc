	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (+OOO, ++OO, +++O, and ++++); the strength of the recommendation (1 or 2); and the difference between a &quot;recommendation&quot; and a &quot;suggestion&quot; are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measurement of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in patients with typical clinical manifestations of acromegaly, especially those with acral and facial features. (1|+++O) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests the measurement of IGF-1 in patients without the typical manifestations of acromegaly, but who have several of these associated conditions: sleep apnea syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, debilitating arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and hypertension. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measuring serum IGF-1 to rule out acromegaly in a patient with a pituitary mass. (1|+++O) </p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against relying on the use of random growth hormone (GH) levels to diagnose acromegaly. (1|+++O) </p>
<p>In patients with elevated or equivocal serum IGF-1 levels, the Task Force recommends confirmation of the diagnosis by finding lack of suppression of GH to &amp;lt;1 &amp;micro;g/L following documented hyperglycemia during an oral glucose load. (1|+++O) </p>
<p>Following biochemical diagnosis of acromegaly, the Task Force recommends performing an imaging study to visualize tumor size and appearance, as well as parasellar extent (1|++++). The Task Force suggests magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the imaging modality of choice, followed by computed tomography (CT) scan when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests performing formal visual field testing when the tumor is found to abut the optic chiasm on an imaging study. (2|+++O)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Presentation and Management of Comorbidities and Mortality Risk</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests evaluating all patients presenting with acromegaly for associated comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force also recommends that such comorbidities be longitudinally monitored and rigorously managed. (Ungraded recommendation) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests screening for colon neoplasia with colonoscopy at diagnosis. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests a thyroid ultrasound if there is palpable thyroid nodularity. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force recommends assessing for hypopituitarism and replacing hormone deficits. (1|+++O)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Goals of Management</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests a biochemical target goal of an age-normalized serum IGF-1 value, which signifies control of acromegaly. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests using a random GH &amp;lt;1.0 &amp;micro;g/L as a therapeutic goal, as this correlates with control of acromegaly. (2|+OOO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests maintaining the same GH and IGF-1 assay in the same patient throughout management. (2|++OO) </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Indications</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends transsphenoidal surgery as the primary therapy in most patients. (1|+++O) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that repeat surgery be considered in a patient with residual intrasellar disease following initial surgery. (2|++OO) </p>
<p><strong>Preoperative Medical Therapy</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against the routine use of preoperative medical therapy to improve biochemical control after surgery. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>For patients with severe pharyngeal thickness and sleep apnea, or high-output heart failure, the Task Force suggests medical therapy with somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) preoperatively to reduce surgical risk from severe comorbidities. (2|+OOO)</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Debulking</strong></p>
<p>In a patient with parasellar disease making total surgical resection unlikely, the Task Force suggests surgical debulking to improve subsequent response to medical therapy. (2|++OO)</p>
<p><strong>Postoperative Testing</strong></p>
<p>Following surgery, the Task Force suggests measuring an IGF-1 level and a random GH at 12 weeks or later (2|+++O). The Task Force suggest measuring a nadir GH level after a glucose load in a patient with a GH greater than 1 &amp;micro;g/L. (2|+++O) </p>
<p>The Task Force recommends performing an imaging study at least 12 weeks after surgery to visualize residual tumor and adjacent structures (1|+++O). The Task Force suggests MRI as the imaging modality of choice followed by CT scan when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. (2|++OO)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Medical Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends medical therapy in a patient with persistent disease following surgery. (1|++++) </p>
<p>In a patient with significant disease (i.e., with moderate-to-severe signs and symptoms of GH excess and without local mass effects), the Task Force suggests use of either a SRL or pegvisomant as the initial adjuvant medical therapy. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>In a patient with only modest elevations of serum IGF-1 and mild signs and symptoms of GH excess, the Task Force suggests a trial of a dopamine agonist, usually cabergoline, as the initial adjuvant medical therapy. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against routine abdominal ultrasound to monitor for gallstone disease in a patient receiving a SRL (2|++OO). Ultrasound should be performed if the patient has signs and symptoms of gallstone disease. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests serial imaging with MRI scan to evaluate tumor size in a patient receiving pegvisomant. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests monitoring liver function tests monthly for the first 6 months and then every 6 months in a patient receiving pegvisomant, with consideration of discontinuation of pegvisomant if the transaminases are greater than 3-fold elevated. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests addition of pegvisomant or cabergoline in a patient with inadequate response to an SRL. (2|++OO) </p>
<p>The Task Force suggests use of an SRL as primary therapy in a patient who cannot be cured by surgery, has extensive cavernous sinus invasion, does not have chiasmal compression, or is a poor surgical candidate. (2|+++O)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Radiotherapy (RT)/Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT)</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests use of RT in the setting of residual tumor mass following surgery, and if medical therapy is unavailable, unsuccessful, or not tolerated. (2|++OO)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests use of SRT over conventional RT in patients with acromegaly, unless the technique is not available, there is significant residual tumor burden, or the tumor is too close to the optic chiasm resulting in an exposure of more than 8 Gy. (2|++OO)</p>
<p>To monitor the efficacy of RT, the Task Force recommends annual GH/IGF-1 reassessment following medication withdrawal. (1|+++O) </p>
<p>The Task Force recommends annual hormonal testing of patients following RT for hypopituitarism and other delayed radiation effects. (1|++++)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Special Circumstances</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gigantism</strong></p>
<p>In patients with the rare presentation of gigantism, the Task Force recommends the standard approaches to normalizing GH and IGF-1 hypersecretion as described elsewhere in this guideline. (1|+++O)</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests discontinuing long-acting SRL formulations and pegvisomant approximately 2 months before attempts to conceive, with use of short-acting octreotide as necessary until conception. (2|++OO)</p>
<p>During pregnancy, the Task Force recommends that acromegaly medical therapy be withheld and administered only for tumor and headache control. (1|++OO)</p>
<p>During pregnancy, the Task Force suggests serial visual field testing in patients with macroadenomas. (2|+++O)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against monitoring GH and/or IGF-1 levels during pregnancy. (2|+++O)</p>

<p><strong>Study Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers included original controlled and uncontrolled studies (prospective and retrospective) that enrolled patients with acromegaly and were recruited to receive either surgical treatment or medical treatment as their first-line treatment (treatment na&amp;iuml;ve). Medical treatment was restricted to somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs; octreotide or lanreotide) and a transsphenoidal surgery approach. The follow-up period was defined as 3 months or longer.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive literature search was conducted by an expert reference librarian with input from the study's principal investigator and Endocrine Society Task Force members. The search included Medline in-process and other non-indexed citations, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. A combination of controlled vocabulary and key words was used to search for patients with acromegaly who received any form of surgical treatment or medical treatments as shown in Table 5 in the systematic review document. The reviewers, working independently and in duplicate, identified original studies eligible for further review by screening abstracts and titles. If a study was deemed relevant, the manuscript was obtained and reviewed in full-text version for further assessment. Any inclusion or exclusion disagreements were discussed and reconciled by a third investigator. Previously described data sources, including citing articles and relevant systematic reviews, were searched manually for possible studies, and duplicates were excluded. The reviewers expanded the search to include all languages, with last date of inclusion to be April 2014. Non-English articles were translated and assessed with the help of native or efficient speakers of the corresponding language used in the article.</p>

<p><strong>Study Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included original controlled and uncontrolled studies (prospective and retrospective) that enrolled patients with acromegaly and were recruited to receive either stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or radiotherapy (RT). They searched for comparative studies and when not possible, they included single arms from studies that reported treatment-na&amp;iuml;ve interventions of interest. Radiosurgical techniques included mainly GammaKnife, LINAC, and Proton beam. RT included conventional, external beam, fractioned, and LINAC radiotherapy.</p>

<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently extracted data from each study. They extracted data on patient demographics, baseline characteristics, study design variables, sample size, levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone (GH) pre- and post-therapy levels, and remission rate, when reported. In addition, for each study, reviewers extracted variables related to acromegaly in the relevant intervention group.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Because of the noncomparative nature of the available studies, the reviewers modified the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale by removing the comparability criteria that is not applicable for the research question. Quality assessment focused on cohort selection, outcome ascertainment, and attrition. The untreated arms of interventional studies were considered as case series for quality assessment purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Outcomes of interest were biochemical remission (calculated as rates), mean difference (change) between pre- and post-interventional IGF-1 and GH levels, and all-cause mortality, when reported. Primary biochemical end points were defined by a strict cutoff criteria of normal serum IGF-1 levels adjusted to age and gender and serum GH less than 1 &amp;micro;g/L. For the subgroup analysis, the reviewers included studies that ascertained remission by IGF-1-only criterion, defined by normal serum levels adjusted to age and gender. They also included studies that ascertained remission by random GH less than 2.5 &amp;micro;g/L or GH nadir after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) less than 1 &amp;micro;g/L. Total remission rates were calculated based on reporting of patients achieving remission based on at least one biochemical remission criterion (GH or IGF-1). Surgeon experience compared if all surgeries reported in the study were performed by the same surgeon (one surgeon experience) vs more than one surgeon. Tumor size was defined as microadenoma (&amp;lt;10 mm) and macroadenoma (&amp;gt;10 mm).</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis and Data Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>For dichotomized outcomes, the reviewers calculated a cumulative incidence at a certain time point (event rate) and estimated the 95% confidence intervals (CI) using binomial distribution. They then pooled the log-transformed event rates using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models with the heterogeneity estimated from the Mantel-Haenszel model. For continuous outcomes, the reviewers calculated the weighted difference in means between the baseline and the longest duration of follow-up for each study. The effect size was pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models. The Altman and Bland test was used to compare the outcomes between medical and surgical interventions. The reviewers conducted subgroup analyses based on different remission criteria, the follow-up period, the surgeon's experience, and the type of adenoma tumor. To measure the overall heterogeneity across the included studies, they used <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> statistic, in which <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> greater than 50% suggests high heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 12.1 (StataCorp LP).</p>

Hypopituitarism was defined as loss of &amp;ge;1 anterior pituitary gland axis (e.g., central hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, hypogonadism) as defined in the studies. Loss of any of these individual pituitary function axes were recorded as well. All-cause mortality, headaches and secondary malignancies were also extracted, when reported.</p>

    <li>Common side effects of somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) include abdominal cramps, flatulence, and diarrhea which usually abate with continued treatment. Side effects also include occasional local skin irritation and pain at the injection site. Less common are reversible hair loss and, rarely, alopecia. Because SRLs may inhibit both insulin and glucagon as well as growth hormone (GH) secretion, glucose control usually improves but rarely may worsen. In addition to side effects that are similar to those of octreotide and lanreotide, pasireotide is associated with hyperglycemia in 57% of subjects. </li>
    <li>With the use of pegvisomant, injection site reactions have been reported in 2.2% of patients and include local discomfort, reversible lipohypertrophy, or lipoatrophy. </li>
    <li>There is an increased risk of transient transaminase elevation, reported in 27% of subjects, with the combination of SRL and pegvisomant. </li>
    <li>Side effects of cabergoline include gastrointestinal upset, nasal congestion, fatigue, orthostasis, and headache. Cardiac valve abnormalities occur with high doses of cabergoline used for patients with Parkinson's disease but have not been observed in most studies of patients with prolactinomas treated with conventional doses (&amp;le;2.0 mg/wk). One study in 42 acromegalic patients treated with cabergoline for a median of 35 months showed no increased risk of progressive valvular abnormalities. </li>
    <li>Complications of conventional radiotherapy (RT) in patients with pituitary tumors include radiation-induced cranial nerve damage, secondary tumors, radionecrosis, and cognitive changes. Radionecrosis is a rare complication of gamma knife stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). It has been suggested that SRLs may limit the effectiveness of RT, although this finding was based on nonrandomized and retrospective studies and has been refuted by subsequent studies. Accordingly, there is no basis for the practice of withholding SRLs at the time of RT. </li>
    <li>Complications from surgery include bleeding, spinal fluid leak, meningitis, sodium and water imbalance, and hypopituitarism. Major complications such as carotid artery injury and visual loss are rare. Because of hypertrophic upper airway structures, fiberoptic intubation may be necessary, and careful perioperative airway management is essential. </li>
    <li>False positives for a diagnosis of acromegaly may occur in pregnancy and late-stage adolescence. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict of interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before the members are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict-of-interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (e.g., stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through the Endocrine Society office.</p>
