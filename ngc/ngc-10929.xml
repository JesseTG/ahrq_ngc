	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statement 1a. Pneumatic Otoscopy</span></strong></p>
<p>The clinician should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing otitis media with effusion (OME) in a child.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strong recommendation</span></em> based on systematic review of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statement 1b. Pneumatic Otoscopy</span></strong></p>
<p>The clinician should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strong recommendation</span></em> based on systematic review of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To improve diagnostic accuracy for OME with a readily available but underutilized means of assessing middle ear status (National Quality Strategy domain: clinical process/effectiveness) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic review of cross-sectional studies with a consistent reference standard </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Improve diagnostic certainty; reduce false-negative diagnoses caused by effusions that do not have obvious air bubbles or an air-fluid level; reduce false-positive diagnoses that lead to unnecessary tests and costs; readily available equipment; document mobility of the tympanic membrane; efficient; cost-effective </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Costs of training clinicians in pneumatic otoscopy; false-positive diagnoses from nonintact tympanic membrane; minor procedural discomfort </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Pneumatic otoscopy is underutilized for diagnosing OME, especially in primary care settings; accurate diagnosis of OME using pneumatic otoscopy is a prerequisite for managing children with OME </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Very limited </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statement 2. Tympanometry</span></strong> </p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strong recommendation</span></em> based on extrapolation of systematic reviews of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Improve diagnostic accuracy for OME and raise awareness regarding the value of tympanometry as an objective measure of middle ear status (National Quality Strategy domain: clinical process/effectiveness) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, extrapolation from systematic review of cross-sectional studies with a consistent reference standard for tympanometry as a primary diagnostic method </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High regarding the value of tympanometry for primary diagnosis; medium regarding the value as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy </li>
    <li>Benefit: Improved diagnostic accuracy; confirm a suspected diagnosis of OME; obtain objective information regarding middle ear status; differentiate OME (normal equivalent ear canal volume) vs tympanic membrane perforation (high equivalent ear canal volume); obtain prognostic information on likelihood of timely spontaneous resolution (e.g., a flat, or type B, tracing has the poorest prognosis); educational value in confirming pneumatic otoscopy findings </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Cost; lack of access; equipment calibration and maintenance; misinterpretation of findings </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The individual who performs tympanometry is not specified and could be the clinician or another health professional; whether to use portable or tabletop tympanometry is at the discretion of the clinician </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited </li>
    <li>Exceptions: Patients with recent ear surgery or trauma </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statement 3. Failed Newborn Hearing Screen</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn hearing screen regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a predominance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Increase adherence to follow-up and ensure that an underlying SNHL is not missed (National Quality Strategy domains: care coordination, patient and family engagement) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, indirect observational evidence on the benefits of longitudinal follow-up for effusions in newborn screening programs and the prevalence of SNHL in newborn screening failures with OME </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefit: More prompt diagnosis of SNHL; earlier intervention for hearing loss; reduce loss to follow-up; reassure parents </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Time spent in counseling; parental anxiety from increased focus on child hearing issues </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The method and specifics of follow-up are at the discretion of the clinician but should seek resolution of OME within 3 months of onset or, if not known, diagnosis </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Minimal role regarding the need for counseling but a large role for shared decision making in the specifics of how follow-up is implemented and in what specific care settings </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statement 4a. Identifying At-risk Children</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors (see Table 3 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statement 4b. Evaluating At-risk Children</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should evaluate at-risk children (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time).</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Raise awareness of a subset of children with OME (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) who are disproportionately affected by middle ear effusion as compared with otherwise healthy children and to detect OME in at-risk children that might have been missed without explicit screening but could affect their developmental progress (National Quality Strategy domain: population/public health) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies regarding the high prevalence of OME in at-risk children and the known impact of hearing loss on child development; D, expert opinion on the ability of prompt diagnosis to alter outcomes </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefit: Identify at-risk children who might benefit from early intervention for OME (including tympanostomy tubes) and from more active and accurate surveillance of middle ear status; identify unsuspected OME and reduce the impact of OME and associated hearing loss on child development </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Direct costs of evaluating for OME (e.g., tympanometry), identifying self-limited effusions, parental anxiety, potential for overtreatment </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The guideline update group (GUG) assumed that at-risk children (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) are less likely to tolerate OME than would the otherwise healthy child and that persistent OME could limit the benefit of ongoing therapies and education interventions for at-risk children with special needs; assumption that early identification of OME in at-risk children could improve developmental outcomes </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The method of evaluating for OME is not specified but should follow recommendations in this guideline regarding pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry; an interval of 12 to 18 months is stated to give the clinician flexibility and to ensure that evaluation takes place at a critical time in the child's development </li>

<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Emphasize that regular follow-up is an important aspect of managing chronic OME that can help avoid sequelae by identifying children who develop signs or symptoms that would prompt intervention (National Quality Strategy domains: patient safety, clinical process/effectiveness) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Detection of structural changes in the tympanic membrane that may require intervention; detection of new hearing difficulties or symptoms that would lead to reassessing the need for intervention, including tympanostomy tubes; discussion of strategies for optimizing the listening-learning environment for children with OME; as well as ongoing counseling and education of parents/caregiver </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Cost of follow-up </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Although it is uncommon, untreated OME can cause progressive changes in the tympanic membrane that require surgical intervention. There was an implicit assumption that surveillance and early detection/intervention could prevent complications and would provide opportunities for ongoing education and counseling of caregivers </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The surveillance interval is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months to accommodate provider and patient preference; &quot;significant&quot; hearing loss is broadly defined as that noticed by the caregiver, reported by the child, or interfering with school performance or quality of life</li>

<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Promote effective therapy for OME (tubes at all ages; adenoidectomy age &amp;ge;4 years) and discourage therapy with limited or no benefits (adenoidectomy &amp;lt;4 years old) (National Quality Strategy domains: patient safety, clinical process/effectiveness) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, systematic review of RCTs (tubes, adenoidectomy) and observational studies (adenoidectomy) </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium, because of limited data on long-term benefits of these interventions and heterogeneity among RCTs included in the systematic reviews </li>
    <li>Benefit: Promoting effective therapy; avoiding adenoidectomy in an age group where benefits have not been shown as a primary intervention for OME; benefits of surgery that include improved hearing reduced prevalence of OME, and less need for additional tympanostomy tube insertion (after adenoidectomy) </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Risks of anesthesia and specific surgical procedures, sequelae of tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomy </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Although some studies suggest benefits of adenoidectomy for children &amp;lt;4 years old as primary therapy for OME, the data are inconsistent and relatively sparse; the additional surgical risks of adenoidectomy (e.g., velopharyngeal insufficiency, more complex anesthesia) were felt to outweigh the uncertain benefits in this group </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: For children aged &amp;ge;4 years, the decision to offer tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both is based on shared decision making </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Moderate role in the choice of surgical procedure for children aged &amp;ge;4 years (tubes, adenoidectomy, or both) </li>

<p>The AAO-HNSF assembled a guideline update group (GUG) representing the disciplines of otolaryngology&amp;ndash;head and neck surgery, pediatric otolaryngology, otology, pediatrics, allergy and immunology, family medicine, audiology, speech-language pathology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. The GUG had several conference calls and one in-person meeting during which it defined the scope and objectives of updating the guideline, reviewed comments from the expert panel review for each key action statement, identified other quality improvement opportunities, and reviewed the literature search results.</p>
<p>The evidence profile for each statement in the earlier guideline was then converted into an expanded action statement profile for consistency with the AAO-HNSF's current development standards. Information was added to the action statement profiles regarding the quality improvement opportunity, level of confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, intentional vagueness, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. New key action statements were developed with an explicit and transparent <em>a priori</em> protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. Electronic decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) was used to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles.</p>
<p>The updated guideline underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, improve clarity of recommendations, and predict potential obstacles to implementation. The GUG received summary appraisals and modified an advanced draft of the guideline based on the appraisal.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing otitis media with effusion (OME). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible provider, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline update group (GUG) sought to minimize harm, diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy, and reduce the unnecessary use of systemic antibiotics. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implementation Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The complete guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em>, and an executive summary will be simultaneously published in the main journal. A full-text version of the guideline will also be accessible free of charge at <a href=&quot;http://www.entnet.org&quot; title=&quot;AAO-HNSF Web site&quot;>www.entnet.org</a>, the American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) Web site. The guideline will be presented to AAO-HNSF members as a mini-seminar at the 2015 annual meeting. Existing brochures, publications, and patient information sheets from the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>Although pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were recommended for diagnosing otitis media with effusion (OME) in the first version of this guideline, pneumatic otoscopy in particular continues to be underused in primary care settings. The guideline update group (GUG) provides expanded information on both these diagnostic modalities in the new guideline, but enhanced efforts will still be needed in primary care settings to teach and promote accurate OME diagnosis. The degree to which specialists use pneumatic otoscopy has not been studied, but educational efforts would likely be of benefit to this population as well.</p>
<p>OME is one of the most common reasons that infants fail a newborn hearing test, but ensuring follow-up to assess for resolution of the effusion and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be challenging. AAO-HNSF provides counseling materials in this regard that clinicians can distribute to families of children with OME, but continued education of hospital providers who administer the newborn testing is an additional challenge. The GUG hopes that the new attention focused on this issue by the guideline will promote investigation and change in this area.</p>
<p>The new guideline reaffirms a prior recommendation against routine screening of children for OME but adds a new recommendation that clinicians evaluate at-risk children for OME when the at-risk condition is diagnosed and again at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time). This new recommendation imposes some additional burden on providers, in terms of both remembering to do the assessment and performing the actual evaluation for OME. The GUG showed strong consensus and support for this recommendation as a means to improve quality of care for at-risk children. Implementing this in practice will require continuing medical education strategies and integration into clinical decision support systems.</p>
<p>Whereas antibiotics and oral steroids are used infrequently to treat OME, there is a perception that topical intranasal steroids and antireflux medications are relatively common interventions, despite a lack of evidence for their efficacy. The GUG recommends explicitly against using these for a primary indication of OME, but reinforcement will be needed to implement this strategy, especially through performance measures. This is especially important to avoid costly, ineffective, and potentially harmful care.</p>
<p>Last, the GUG makes a new recommendation that adenoidectomy should not be done for a primary indication of OME in children &amp;lt;4 years old. This contradicts established practice for many clinicians and some information in the prior guideline (e.g., offering adenoidectomy when repeat surgery is required for children &amp;ge;2 years old). Continuing medical education will be needed to explicitly focus on the rationale for this change (e.g., new randomized trials and systematic reviews) to promote uptake in routine clinical practice.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The cost of developing this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed to not discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established &quot;stake&quot; in an issue.</p>
