      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the strength of the recommendations (<strong>Grade 1</strong> or <strong>2</strong>) and quality of the evidence (<strong>Level A&amp;ndash;C</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnostic Evaluation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Examination</strong></p>
<p>For clinical examination of the lower limbs for chronic venous disease (CVD), the Guideline Committee recommends inspection (telangiectasia, varicosity, edema, skin discoloration, corona phlebectatica, lipodermatosclerosis, ulcer), palpation (cord, varicosity, tenderness, induration, reflux, pulses, thrill, groin or abdominal masses), auscultation (bruit), and examination of ankle mobility. Patients should be asked for symptoms of CVD, which may include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle cramps, swelling, sensations of throbbing or heaviness, itching skin, restless legs, leg tiredness, and fatigue (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Duplex Scanning</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that in patients with CVD, a complete history and detailed physical examination are complemented by duplex scanning of the deep and superficial veins. The test is safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that the four components of a complete duplex scanning examination for chronic venous disease should be visualization, compressibility, venous flow, including measurement of duration of reflux, and augmentation (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that reflux to confirm valvular incompetence in the upright position of the patients be elicited in one of two ways: either with increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva maneuver to assess the common femoral vein and the saphenofemoral junction, or for the more distal veins, use of manual or cuff compression and release of the limb distal to the point of examination (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 500 ms for the great saphenous vein, the small saphenous vein, the tibial, deep femoral, and the perforating veins (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, duplex scanning of the perforating veins is performed selectively. The Guideline Committee recommends that the definition of &quot;pathologic&quot; perforating veins includes those with an outward flow of duration of &amp;ge;500 ms, with a diameter of &amp;ge;3.5 mm and a location beneath healed or open venous ulcers (clinical, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology [CEAP] class C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). See Table II in the original guideline document for definitions of CEAP classes.</p>
<p><strong>Plethysmography</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests that venous plethysmography be used selectively for the noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C<sub>2</sub>) (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that venous plethysmography be used for the noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with advanced CVD if duplex scanning does not provide definitive information on pathophysiology (CEAP class C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Imaging Studies</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that in patients with varicose veins and more advanced CVD, computed tomography venography, magnetic resonance venography, ascending and descending contrast venography, and intravascular ultrasonography are used selectively, including but not limited to post-thrombotic syndrome, thrombotic or nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome), pelvic congestion syndrome, nutcracker syndrome, vascular malformations, venous trauma, tumors, and planned open or endovascular venous interventions (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that in patients with CVD, evaluation for thrombophilia is needed selectively for those with recurrent deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in an unusual site. Laboratory examination is needed in patients with longstanding venous stasis ulcers (blood cell count and metabolic panel) and in selected patients who undergo general anesthesia for the treatment of CVD. (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that CEAP classification be used for patients with CVD. The basic CEAP classification is used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system is used for clinical research (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that primary venous disorders, including simple varicose veins, be differentiated from secondary venous insufficiency and from congenital venous disorders because the three conditions differ in pathophysiology and management (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcome Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is used for assessment of clinical outcome after therapy for varicose veins and more advanced chronic CVD (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends that a quality-of-life assessment is performed with a disease-specific instrument to evaluate patient-reported outcome and the severity of CVD. (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends duplex scanning for follow-up of patients after venous procedures who have symptoms or recurrence of varicose veins (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends reporting procedure-related minor and major complications after therapy (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Medical Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests venoactive drugs (diosmin, hesperidin, rutosides, sulodexide, micronized purified flavonoid fraction, or horse chestnut seed extract [aescin]) for patients with pain and swelling due to CVD, in countries where these drugs are available (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests using pentoxifylline or micronized purified flavonoid fraction, if available, in combination with compression, to accelerate healing of venous ulcers (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Compression Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests compression therapy using moderate pressure (20 to 30 mm Hg) for patients with symptomatic varicose veins (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends against compression therapy as the primary treatment of symptomatic varicose veins in patients who are candidates for saphenous vein ablation (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends compression as the primary therapeutic modality for healing venous ulcers (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends compression as an adjuvant treatment to superficial vein ablation for the prevention of ulcer recurrence (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Open Venous Surgery</strong></p>
<p>For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein, the Guideline Committee suggests high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p>To reduce hematoma formation, pain, and swelling, the Guideline Committee recommends postoperative compression. The recommended period of compression in C<sub>2</sub> patients is 1 week (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>For treatment of small saphenous vein incompetence, the Guideline Committee recommends high ligation of the vein at the knee crease, about 3 to 5 cm distal to the saphenopopliteal junction, with selective invagination stripping of the incompetent portion of the vein (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>To decrease recurrence of venous ulcers, the Guideline Committee recommends ablation of the incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic treatment of varicose veins (CHIVA) technique only selectively in patients with varicose veins, when performed by trained venous interventionists (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory selective varicose vein ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL) procedure only selectively in patients with varicose veins (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends ambulatory phlebectomy for treatment of varicose veins, performed with saphenous vein ablation, either during the same procedure or at a later stage. If general anesthesia is required for phlebectomy, the Guideline Committee suggests concomitant saphenous ablation (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests transilluminated powered phlebectomy using lower oscillation speeds and extended tumescence as an alternative to traditional phlebectomy for extensive varicose veins (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p>For treatment of recurrent varicose veins, the Guideline Committee suggests ligation of the saphenous stump, ambulatory phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, or endovenous thermal ablation, depending on the etiology, source, location, and extent of varicosity (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Endovenous Thermal Ablation</strong></p>
<p>Endovenous thermal ablations (laser and radiofrequency ablations) are safe and effective, and the Guideline Committee recommends them for treatment of saphenous incompetence (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>Because of reduced convalescence and less pain and morbidity, the Guideline Committee recommends endovenous thermal ablation of the incompetent saphenous vein over open surgery (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Sclerotherapy of Varicose Veins</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends liquid or foam sclerotherapy for telangiectasia, reticular veins, and varicose veins (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>For treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein, the Guideline Committee recommends endovenous thermal ablation over chemical ablation with foam (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Special Venous Problems</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Perforating Veins</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends against selective treatment of incompetent perforating veins in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C<sub>2</sub>) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests treatment of &quot;pathologic&quot; perforating veins that includes those with an outward flow duration of &amp;ge;500 ms, with a diameter of &amp;ge;3.5 mm, located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer (CEAP class C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>) (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p>For treatment of &quot;pathologic&quot; perforating veins, the Guideline Committee suggests subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery, ultrasonographically guided sclerotherapy, or thermal ablations (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Pelvic Varicose Veins</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends noninvasive imaging with transabdominal and/or transvaginal ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance venography in selected patients with symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome or symptomatic varices in the distribution of the pubis, labia, perineum, or buttocks (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee recommends retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography in patients with pelvic venous disease, confirmed or suspected by noninvasive imaging studies, in whom an intervention is planned (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p>The Guideline Committee suggests treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p>If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, the Guideline Committee suggests surgical ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that enrolled participants with primary varicose veins who were treated with surgery, sclerotherapy, foam sclerotherapy, percutaneous endovenous thermal interventions (ablation with radiofrequency or laser), or conservative management with compression stockings. Reviewers included studies that measured any of the outcomes of varicose veins recurrence, patient satisfaction, esthetics, time to return to work, pain, and procedurally related complications, including local wound complications, such as infection and hematoma, and systemic complications, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), air embolism, and pulmonary fibrosis. Studies were included regardless of their language, sample size, surgical technique, or duration of patient follow-up. Single-cohort studies (i.e., studies in which all patients received the same treatment without concurrent comparison groups) were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Study Identification and Data Collection</strong></p>
<p>An expert reference librarian designed and conducted the electronic search strategy with input from study investigators with expertise in conducting systematic reviews. To identify eligible studies, electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched through February 2008 and monitored the literature for new publications thereafter. References from experts, bibliographies of included trials, and the Institute for Scientific Information Science Citation Index for publications that cited included studies were also sought. A combination of subject headings and text words were used as needed to define varicosities and the various procedures. Results were limited to comparative studies. The detailed search strategy is available from the authors upon request.</p>
<p>References were uploaded in a Web-based software package developed for systematic review data management (SRS, TrialStat Corp, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Paired reviewers working independently screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility. References that were deemed potentially relevant were retrieved in full text and uploaded for full text evaluation against eligibility criteria. The chance-adjusted inter-reviewer agreement (&amp;kappa; statistic) for study eligibility was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.93). Disagreements were resolved by consensus (the two reviewers discussed the study and reached a consensus), and when disagreement continued, by arbitration (a third reviewer adjudicated the study). Teams of two reviewers working independently and using a standardized form extracted data in duplicate from all eligible studies, including study description, methodologic quality, and outcome data.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statistical Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>When appropriate, the reviewers pooled relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes from each trial using the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome to reflect the uncertainty of point estimates of effect. A RR of 1.0 indicates no difference between the two interventions in association with a particular outcome. A RR &amp;gt;1.0 indicates that compared with the control intervention, the procedure increased the risk of outcome occurrence. For continuous outcomes, reviewers planned to estimate the weighted effect size and the 95% CI, and for outcomes assessed with multiple scales, the Guideline Committee planned to estimate the standardized mean difference. The reviewers used the <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> statistic, which estimates the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (i.e., the percentage of variability in treatment effects across trials that is not due to chance or random error, but rather due to real differences in study patients, design or interventions). The<em> I</em><sup>2</sup> values of &amp;le;25%, 50%, and &amp;ge;75% represent low, moderate, and high inconsistency, respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted using StatsDirect 2.5.4 software (StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire, United Kingdom).</p>
<p><strong>Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses</strong></p>
<p>The a priori hypotheses to explore subgroup interactions and explain inconsistencies in the direction and magnitude of effect among studies included variation in bias protection measures and patient characteristics such as sex. Reviewers also planned to stratify results according to severity of chronic venous disease using the clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology (CEAP) classification, when reported (published in 1994 and revised in 2004). Reviewers planned to test the hypotheses of a subgroup effect using a test of interaction and to conduct meta-regression to assess the correlation between the effect size and the length of study follow-up. Sensitivity analysis to exclude short-term studies that were unlikely to evaluate outcome of interest was also conducted.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Guidelines for the care of patients with varicose veins, as recommended in the original guideline document, are based on scientific evidence. The need for adopting evidence-based guidelines and reporting standards for venous diseases has long been recognized by international experts and by leaders of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and American Venous Forum (AVF). To define current guidelines, members of the Venous Guideline Committee reviewed the relevant literature, including previously published consensus documents and guidelines, meta-analyses, the AVF reports on the Venous Summit at the 2006 and 2009 Pacific Vascular Symposiums and considered the recommendations published in the third edition of the <em>Handbook of Venous Disorders, Guidelines of the American Venous Forum</em>.</p>
<p>The guidelines are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, as it was described by Guyatt et al. (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). For each guideline, the letter A, B, or C marks the level of current evidence. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs the expected benefit.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The risk of perioperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is increased in patients with thrombophilia, in those with a history of DVT or thrombophlebitis, and in obese patients. </li>
    <li>Wound complications usually occur in 3% to 10% of patients undergoing open venous surgery, with reported wound infection rates as low as 1.5% and as high as 16%. </li>
    <li>DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) are rare but occasionally serious complications of superficial vein surgery. </li>
    <li>Reported complications after transilluminated powered phlebectomy (TIPP) have varied considerably and include ecchymosis and hematoma in 4.9% to 95%, paresthesias and nerve injury in 9.5% to 39%, skin perforation in 1.2% to 5%, superficial phlebitis in 2.4% to 13%, swelling in 5% to 17.5%, hyperpigmentation in 1.2% to 3.3%, residual or recurrent varicose veins in 9.1% to 21.2%, and DVT in &amp;lt;1%. </li>
    <li>Complications associated with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) include bruising, paresthesia, thrombophlebitis, skin burns, DVT and PE. </li>
    <li>Complications associated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) include paresthesia, thrombophlebitis, ecchymosis along the course of the great saphenous vein (GSV), and skin pigmentation. </li>
    <li>Severe complications after sclerotherapy, such as death, anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary emboli, stroke, and large areas of skin necrosis, are very rare (&amp;lt;0.01%). Severe but rare complications also include thrombophlebitis, nerve damage (saphenous, sural), DVT, or inadvertent arterial injection of the solution. Transient neurologic adverse effects such as visual disturbance, migraine-like headache, or confusional state may occur and are more frequent in patients with a patent foramen ovale. Most complications are minor, and include matting, pigmentation, pain, allergy, and skin urticaria. The higher the concentration of the agent, the higher the likelihood of hyperpigmentation, a minor complication that can be observed in up to 30% of the cases. Between 70% and 95% of the pigmentations, however, resolve by 1 year after therapy. The incidence of major neurologic events after foam injection is rare; instances of stroke were reported by several authors. Immediate treatment with 100% oxygen and possibly hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be considered. Factors implicated in the risk of stroke after foam sclerotherapy include the use of air instead of carbon dioxide to prepare the foam, large bubble size, a patent foramen ovale, failure to elevate the limb after treatment, prolonged immobility after therapy, and an excessive amount of foam used during one session. Refer to the original guideline document for additional discussion of complications of sclerotherapy. </li>
    <li>Wound infection and saphenous neuralgia each occurred in 6% of patients undergoing subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS). </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Inappropriate vein size (&amp;lt;2 mm and &amp;gt;15 mm for radiofrequency ablation [RFA]), a history of superficial thrombophlebitis resulting in a partially obstructed saphenous vein, and the uncommon occurrence of a tortuous great saphenous vein (GSV) on duplex examination are potential contraindications to endovenous thermal ablation. </li>
    <li>There are no absolute contraindications to endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), including vein diameter, although one study had recently suggested an association of central GSV diameter &amp;gt;8 mm with increased risk of extension of thrombus into the femoral vein. Other relative contraindications to EVLA or RFA include uncorrectable coagulopathy, liver dysfunction limiting local anesthetic use, immobility, pregnancy, and breastfeeding </li>
    <li>Advanced stages of chronic venous insufficiency may be associated with limitations or contraindications to surgical treatment by conventional vein stripping, including extensive dermatosclerosis, fibrosis, ulcer scarring sequelae, active ulcers, edema, or lymphedema, thus making the use of alternative methods of treatment necessary. </li>

    <li>Under no circumstance should these <em>Guidelines</em> be construed in practice or legal terms as defining the &quot;standard of care,&quot; which is solely determined by the condition of the individual patient, treatment setting, and other factors. Individual factors in a given patient, such as symptom variance or combinations, comorbidities, work, and socioeconomic factors may dictate a different approach than that described in the <em>Guidelines</em>. Because technology and disease knowledge is rapidly expanding, new approaches may supersede these recommendations. As important new information on management of varicose veins and related chronic venous diseases (CVD) becomes available, these recommendations will be revised without delay. </li>
    <li>Despite the challenges and inconsistent availability of high-quality evidence, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) maintains its effort to summarize, synthesize, and present all the available evidence, along with clear clinical practice recommendations, to help surgeons and their patients in decision making. Although the SVS uses state-of-the-art approaches, such as Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework (GRADE), innovations are needed to improve the quality of evidence in the field and to improve the clarity and usefulness of these guidelines, which will lead to increased confidence in the advice vascular surgeons provide to their patients. Given the limited quality of the evidence, the issues with generalizability, and the importance of patient values, practice guidelines should not be regarded as definitive or prescriptive. Consistent with the tenets of evidence-based medicine, they should be used to inform clinical decision making in the context of the physician's clinical expertise and the patient's underlying values and preferences. </li>
