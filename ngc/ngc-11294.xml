	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions requiring pulp therapy, is one particular therapy (indirect pulp therapy [IPT], direct pulp cap [DPC], pulpotomy) more successful than others?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The panel was unable to make a recommendation on superiority of any particular type of vital pulp therapy owing to lack of studies directly comparing these interventions.</p>

<p>In vital primary teeth treated with indirect pulp treatment due to deep caries lesions, does the choice of medicament affect success? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The panel found that the success of IPT in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions was independent of the type of medicament used, and therefore recommends that clinicians choose the medicament based on individual preferences.

<p>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with direct pulp cap due to pulp exposure (one mm or less) encountered during carious dentin removal, does the choice of medicament affect success? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The panel found that in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with DPC due to pulp exposure (one mm or less) encountered during caries removal, the success of DPC was independent of the type of medicament (dentin bonding agents, mineral trioxide aggregate [MTA], and formocresol), and therefore recommends that clinicians choose the medicament based on individual preferences. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, very-low quality evidence</strong>) </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Question 4</strong></span></p>
<p>In vital primary teeth with deep caries treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during caries removal, does the choice of medicament or technique affect success? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of MTA in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of formocresol in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of ferric sulfate (FS) in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of lasers in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of tricalcium silicate in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>

<p>In December, 2016, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) Board of Trustees approved a panel nominated by the Evidence-Based Dentistry Committee to develop a new evidence-based clinical practice guideline on vital pulp therapies in primary teeth with deep caries lesions. The panel consisted of pediatric dentists in public and private practice involved in research and education; the stakeholders consisted of authors of the systematic review in addition to representatives from general dentistry, governmental and non-governmental agencies, and international and specialty dental organizations. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Questions Addressed</strong></span></p>
<p>The panel members used the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcome (PICO) formulation to develop the following clinical questions that will aid clinicians in the use of vital pulp therapies in primary teeth with deep caries lesions. </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions requiring pulp therapy, is one particular therapy (indirect pulp treatment, direct pulp cap, pulpotomy) more successful* than others? </li>
    <li>In vital primary teeth treated with indirect pulp treatment due to deep caries lesions, does the choice of medicament affect success*? </li>
    <li>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with direct pulp cap due to pulp exposure (one mm or less) encountered during carious dentin removal, does the choice of medicament affect success*? </li>
    <li>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during caries removal, does the choice of medicament or technique affect success*? </li>
</ol>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Success was defined as overall success simultaneously observed both clinically and radiographically.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Formulation of the Recommendation</strong></span> </p>
<p>To formulate the recommendations, the panel used an evidence-to-decision framework including domains such as priority of the problem, certainty in the evidence, balance between desirable and undesirable consequences, and patients' values and preferences. The strength of a recommendation was assessed to be either strong or conditional, which presents different implications for patients, clinicians, and policy makers (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). </p>
<p>The guidelines were formulated via teleconferences and online forum discussion with members of the workgroup. The panel members discussed all recommendations and issues surrounding the topic under review, and all significant topics such as recommendations were voted upon anonymously.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Understanding the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>A strong recommendation implies in most situations that clinicians should follow the suggested intervention. A conditional recommendation indicates that while the clinician may want to follow the suggested intervention, the panel recognizes that different choices may be appropriate for individual patients. </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Cost-effectiveness of Recommendation</strong></span></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness of a treatment is based on initial and possible retreatment costs. Such a cost-analysis for therapies with proven health benefits and minimal adverse effects is an important consideration for clinicians, patients, and third-party payors. This is especially important when different procedures with similar outcomes are available to treat a specific condition like in the case of vital pulp therapies. A research brief covering claims data for all children with private dental insurance lists vital pulpotomy, in primary or permanent teeth, as one of top 25 most common procedures performed in children with private dental benefits. For ages one through six years, the spending is estimated to be $257, ranging from $160 for children in the lowest quartile of spending to $996 among children in the highest quartile of spending. Considering the number of pulp therapies performed on a population level, cost-effective treatment is a public health issue. However, very limited data exist on cost-effectiveness of various pulp therapies in the primary dentition. The most expensive pulp treatments and modalities with regards to initial costs are mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and laser. Interestingly, a German study using the Markov model followed the first permanent molar with vital asymptomatic exposed pulp treated with direct pulp cap (DPC) using MTA or calcium hydroxide over the lifetime of a 20 year old patient and reported that MTA was more cost-effective than calcium hydroxide despite higher initial treatment costs because expensive retreatments were avoided. </p>
