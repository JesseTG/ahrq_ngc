	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>What is the optimal role of biopsy in the initial management of presumptive low-grade glioma in adults?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>Adult patients with imaging suggestive of a low-grade glioma.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Stereotactic biopsy is recommended when definitive surgical resection is limited by lesions that are deep-seated, not resectable, and/or located within eloquent cortex, or in patients unable to undergo craniotomy due to medical co-morbidities to obtain the critical tissue diagnosis needed for targeted treatment planning for patients with low-grade gliomas. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>What is the best technique for brain biopsy?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>Adult patients with imaging suggestive of a low-grade glioma.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Frameless and frame-based stereotactic brain biopsy (SBB) for low-grade gliomas are recommended based on clinical circumstances as they provide similar diagnostic yield, diagnostic accuracy, morbidity, and mortality. It is recommended the surgeon consider advanced imaging techniques (e.g., perfusion, spectroscopy, metabolic studies) to target specific regions of interest to potentially improve diagnostic accuracy. </p>

<p><strong>Literature Examination Approach</strong></p>
<p>A wide-ranging literature search strategy was undertaken to identify all citations relevant to the management of low grade gliomas. The MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from 1990 through 2012, with additional data being gleaned from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. The search strategies used a combination of subheadings and text words with the specifics of this work being outlined in each guideline section. Reference lists of the publications chosen for full text review were also screened for potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection </strong></p>
<p>The search of the bibliographic databases identified possibly relevant citations for a given topic and often these were large in number. The eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria to screen the citations for each of the questions were determined ahead of time for each section by the writing group. At least two authors evaluated the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria with broad interpretation of the criteria being used initially so as to maximize the likelihood of capturing pertinent information. Cases of disagreement about pertinence were resolved by a third author when needed. The full text articles of the selected abstracts were then collected and the same process of applying the eligibility criteria was carried out again with the more in depth information available. Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented so as to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>

<p>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Review, PubMed, and EMBASE literature searches from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2012, encompassing &quot;all fields&quot; or &quot;search all text&quot; utilizing search strings to identify pertinent literature on biopsy of low grade glioma were undertaken. For PubMed the following search terms were used: low-grade glioma biopsy, LGG biopsy, stereotactic brain biopsy, brain biopsy sampling error, brain biopsy sampling errors, low-grade glioma sample error, and low-grade glioma sampling errors. For the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE the following search terms were used: biopsy/and brain neoplasms/, brain neoplasms/and stereotactic techniques/, glioma/and stereotactic techniques/, and glioma/and biopsy. For the Cochrane Library the following search terms were used: low-grade glioma biopsy, stereotactic brain biopsy, biopsy and brain neoplasm, brain neoplasms and stereotactic techniques, glioma and stereotactic technique, and glioma and biopsy.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>For literature to be included for consideration, the paper had to include adults (i.e., age 18 and above), with the following exclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Non-English publications </li>
    <li>Basic science papers </li>
    <li>Animal studies </li>
    <li>Papers dedicated to pediatric gliomas (i.e., age less than 18) </li>
    <li>Papers describing only malignant or high-grade glioma (glioblastoma multiforme; GBM) </li>
    <li>Papers describing recurrent gliomas (recurrent astrocytoma, progressive astrocytoma) </li>
    <li>Papers focusing exclusively on surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or anesthesia, stereotactic guided surgical (e.g., stereotactic resection of arteriovenous malformation), psychiatric, infectious (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], abscess, fungal), vascular, pathologic analysis (e.g., immunohistochemical staining), and spinal cord tumors </li>
</ul>
<p>Because the published literature lacks large series of patients with presumed low grade glioma undergoing targeted stereotactic biopsies directed by advanced imaging modalities (e.g., perfusion, single-photon positron emission tomography [SPECT]), small cases series of fewer than 25 patients were included.</p>

<p><strong>Quality Assessment and Statistical Methods</strong></p>
<p>Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented so as to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p>Studies which met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by one reviewer and the extracted information was checked by one or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all of the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact filled manner so as to allow for understanding of the literature entry. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the scientific foundation of each section so as to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee Guideline Development Methodology document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing between writers electronically, by telephone and meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Specific Evidence Analysis for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Selection and Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Following broad screening for relevance, two independent reviewers evaluated citations and full-text screening of potentially relevant papers using a priori criteria for data extraction on a standardized form. Disagreements were resolved with the involvement of a third reviewer, followed by primary re-review until agreement was achieved. Studies that met the eligibility criteria were extracted by one reviewer and this was then checked by a second reviewer.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Classification and Recommendation Levels</strong></p>
<p>Both the quality of the evidence and the eventual strength of the recommendations generated by this evidence were graded according to a three-tiered system for assessing studies addressing diagnostic testing as approved by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). </p>
<p>Articles were chosen that allowed for the calculation of two stereotactic brain biopsy (SBB)-specific parameters: diagnostic yield and diagnostic accuracy. In order to achieve Class I or II evidence, a well-designed SBB study had to calculate sensitivity and specificity values. Of note, given the inherent hemorrhage risk with brain biopsy, designing a double-blinded study with controls has yet to be done.</p>
<p>Diagnostic yield is the percent of stereotactic biopsies that obtain a histopathologic diagnosis. The &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnostic yield was defined as the ability to obtain diagnostic tissue. Therefore, for diagnostic yield to achieve Class I or II evidence rating, a well-designed SBB trial would have to compare a targeting modality (i.e., surgical or imaging) with a SBB specimen.</p>
<p>Diagnostic accuracy is the proportion of stereotactic biopsies that agree with the &quot;gold standard&quot; of surgical resection or autopsy. For diagnostic accuracy, the Task Force defined the &quot;gold standard&quot; to be the comparison with brain tissue obtained at a subsequent craniotomy or at autopsy. Therefore, for diagnostic accuracy to achieve Class I or II evidence rating, a well-designed SBB trial would have to compare SBB with a surgical resection or autopsy brain specimen. Interestingly, surgical or autopsy specimens would never result in an incorrect histopathologic diagnosis, explaining why the calculated specificity and negative predictive values will always be 0%.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Panel Development</span></strong></p>
<p>Recognizing the serious nature of low grade gliomas along with the lack of consensus among various treatment options, the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) recommended that evidence-based guidelines be developed as a top priority, for the diagnosis, management and treatment of low grade glioma patients. The objectives of these guidelines are to establish the best evidence-based management of low grade gliomas in terms of imaging diagnosis, use of surgical biopsy and resection, assessment of tumor pathology, administration of systemic chemotherapy, and administration of radiation therapy. Because these tumors dependably recur or progress despite standard therapy, the Joint Tumor Section also recommended an evidence-based guideline be developed for progressive low grade gliomas and that information on promising emerging therapies be assessed in the same manner to determine the possible application of these findings.</p>
<p>Having identified the topical objectives, the Guidelines Committee of the Joint Tumor Section then recruited experts in the field from each of the parent organizations as lead writers of each section. These writers, in turn, recruited experts in non-neurosurgical specialties relevant to the field of management and therapy chosen. Writers were provided training on the method of guideline development as used in this guideline set by written methods and instructions. The senior authors and CNS Guidelines Manager then worked with them on a step by step basis to confirm that the methods were followed as the literature was collected, assessed and documents developed. When writers were approached and preliminarily agreed to participate they were asked to complete a formal conflict of interest questionnaire confirming the appropriateness of their participation. At that point they also agreed to report any new conflicts of interest that might develop during the writing process. In this manner a multidisciplinary panel of writers referred to as the Low Grade Glioma Guidelines Task Force was assembled, with significant administrative, logistical and analytical support from the national CNS Guidelines Committee. The method of this evidence-based clinical practice parameter guideline has been written in a manner to be as transparent as possible using published assessment criteria. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Topic Range of This Systematic Review and Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>Having identified writing groups for each topic, the members designed questions to allow assessment of the literature in a manner that would provide guidance for management of low grade gliomas. These questions are presented at the beginning of each of the eight guideline chapters spanning the topics of imaging assessment, diagnostic biopsy, surgical resection, tumor evaluation by standard neuropathology and molecular techniques, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, emerging therapies and treatment of recurrent or progressive low grade gliomas.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise, in order to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>"/>
