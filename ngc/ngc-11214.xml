	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Insulin Pump Therapy without Sensor Augmentation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over analog-based basal-bolus multiple daily injections (MDI) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who have not achieved their A1C goal, as long as the patient and caregivers are willing and able to use the device. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends CSII over analog-based basal-bolus MDI in patients with T1DM who have achieved their A1C goal but continue to experience severe hypoglycemia or high glucose variability, as long as the patient and caregivers are willing and able to use the device. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests CSII in patients with T1DM who require increased insulin delivery flexibility or improved satisfaction and are capable of using the device. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Insulin Pump Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests CSII with good adherence to monitoring and dosing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have poor glycemic control despite intensive insulin therapy, oral agents, other injectable therapy, and lifestyle modifications. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Insulin Pump Use in the Hospital</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that clinicians continue CSII in patients admitted to the hospital with either type of diabetes if the institution has clear protocols for evaluating patients as suitable candidates and appropriate monitoring and safety procedures. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Selection of Candidates for Insulin Pump Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that before prescribing CSII, clinicians perform a structured assessment of a patient's mental and psychological status, prior adherence with diabetes self-care measures, willingness and interest in trying the device, and availability for the required follow-up visits. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Use of Bolus Calculators in Insulin Pump Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests encouraging patients to use appropriately adjusted embedded bolus calculators in CSII and have appropriate education regarding their use and limitations. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitors in Adult Outpatients </span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) devices for adult patients with T1DM who have A1C levels above target and who are willing and able to use these devices on a nearly daily basis. (<strong>1|++++)</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends RT-CGM devices for adult patients with well-controlled T1DM who are willing and able to use these devices on a nearly daily basis. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests short-term, intermittent RT-CGM use in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (not on prandial insulin) who have A1C levels &amp;ge;7% and are willing and able to use the device. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Education and Training on the Use of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion and Continuous Glucose Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that adults with T1DM and T2DM who use CSII and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) receive education, training, and ongoing support to help achieve and maintain individualized glycemic goals. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality of the Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>+OOO</strong> Denotes very low quality evidence</p>
<p><strong>++OO</strong> Denotes low quality evidence</p>
<p><strong>+++O</strong> Denotes moderate quality evidence</p>
<p><strong>++++</strong> Denotes high quality evidence</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>1</strong> - Indicates a strong recommendation and is associated with the phrase &quot;The Task Force recommends.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> - Denotes a weak recommendation and is associated with the phrase &quot;The Task Force suggests.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>: In this guideline, the Task Force made several statements to emphasize the importance of shared decision making, general preventive care measures, and basic principles of diabetes technology. They labeled these &quot;Ungraded Good Practice Statement.&quot; Direct evidence for these statements was either unavailable or not systematically appraised and was considered out of the scope of this guideline. The intention of these statements is to draw attention and remind providers of these principles; one should not consider these statements as graded recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>A list of potential included studies was sent to the Endocrine Society Task Force developing the guideline on real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RTCGM) for verification. The corresponding author of each trial was contacted via emails requesting individual patient data. Data from each participant included (when available): demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (baseline, during follow-up, at the endpoint), follow-up period, number of events of hypoglycemia (whether symptomatic or not, value of glucose), time spend in hypoglycemia, time of the episode of hypoglycemia (night, day, after exercise/playtime for children), type of device/manufacture/sensor versus no sensor, body mass index (BMI), weight, skill level and education provided to patient/parents' education, adherence to wearing the device, diabetes duration, and insulin delivery system (pump versus multiple daily injections). The reviewers used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to appraise the methodological limitations of each trial.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 14 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). A two-step regression model was used to estimate the pooled difference in means for HbA1c and time in hypoglycemia with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When reported, the reviewers pooled the mean number of hypoglycemic events in each arm. Subgroup analysis was based on age and sex.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Risk of Bias Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The overall risk of bias in the included trials was moderate to high. Quality was downgraded mainly due to not reporting allocation concealment, lack of outcome assessor blinding and source of funding (in all trials, funding source was for profit companies).</p></div>"/>

    <li>The goal of glucose management in all types of diabetes is to minimize and hopefully eliminate the acute and chronic complications associated with diabetes, such as the risks of microvascular complications and potentially (to a lesser degree) macrovascular complications and mortality. All persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) require insulin, and persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently need insulin for adequate glucose control. Advances in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin products and in the methods of insulin delivery and glucose monitoring are geared toward improving glucose control, minimizing hypoglycemia, and improving quality of life. Two such advances include continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). </li>
    <li>Despite the limitations of the available literature, there is relatively consistent evidence that current CSII is likely to improve glucose control in motivated patients with inadequate glucose control who are appropriately educated and supported. </li>
