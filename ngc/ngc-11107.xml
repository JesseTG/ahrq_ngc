	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendation (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the role of ophthalmologic evaluation in pretreatment assessment of nonfunctioning adenoma patients?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Pretreatment evaluation of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) patients by an ophthalmologist is recommended. Ophthalmologic evaluation identifies patients with asymptomatic visual deficits due to the ophthalmologist's ability to quantitate psychophysical (acuity and visual fields), functional (quantitation of afferent pupillary defect and visual evoked potentials [VEP]), and anatomical (disc appearance and ocular coherence tomography [OCT]) assessment. Ophthalmologic evaluation may also provide prognostic factors for recovery and, when paired with postoperative evaluation, documents postoperative change.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Are there ophthalmologic tests of particular value in the pretreatment assessment of nonfunctioning adenoma patients?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Automated static perimetry is recommended for early detection of visual field deficits, many of which the patient will be unaware of, in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Automated static perimetry, even with a standard III size test object, will often pick up subtle bitemporal visual field defects, less commonly homonymous defects, and, infrequently, arcuate defects characteristic of optic nerve pathology. </li>
    <li>Visual evoked potentials may be used to assess the optic nerves in nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma patients in a manner that may correlate with visual field deficits, but false positives and negatives may limit this testing to cases in which psychophysical areas, such as acuity and visual fields, cannot be assessed. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Are there preoperative prognostic factors associated with the chances of postoperative vision improvement after nonfunctioning adenoma resection that can inform patients and their providers?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>It is recommended that older patients and patients with longer duration (&amp;gt;4 months) of vision loss be counseled regarding the reduced chance of postoperative vision improvement. </li>
    <li>Formal ophthalmologic examination, looking for optic nerve atrophy or OCT to measure both retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and the presence of damage to the ganglion cell layer on algorithms that segment the macular cube, is recommended to assess a patient's chances of postoperative vision improvement. </li>
    <li>Although not yet standard of practice, anatomic assessment of the anterior visual pathways provided with the use of optical coherence tomography documents previous damage, showing evidence of nerve fiber bundle thinning and evidence of ganglion cell dropout with segmentation analysis. </li>

<p><strong>Evidence Classification for Prognostic Studies</strong></p>
<p>In order to evaluate papers addressing prognosis, five technical criteria are applied:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Was a well-defined representative sample of patients assembled at a common (usually early) point in the course of their disease? </li>
    <li>Was patient follow-up sufficiently long and complete? </li>
    <li>Were objective outcome criteria applied in a &quot;blinded&quot; fashion? </li>
    <li>If subgroups with different prognoses were identified, was there adjustment for important prognostic factors? </li>
    <li>If specific prognostic factors were identified, was there validation in an independent &quot;test set&quot; group of patients? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> - All 5 technical criteria above are satisfied</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> - Four of five technical criteria are satisfied</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> - Everything else</p>

<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Searches were conducted in two electronic databases, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the guideline task force members and medical/research librarians using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies. The root search strategies are provided in Appendix A of the introduction and methodology companion and the chapter-specific search strategies are provided in the appendix of the full version of the guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations were also screened. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below. The guideline task force also examines lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were retrieved and included only if they met specific inclusion criteria. These criteria were also applied to articles provided by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members who supplemented the electronic database searches with manual searches of the bibliographies. To reduce bias, these criteria were specified <em>a priori </em>before conducting the literature searches. For the purposes of this guideline, articles had to meet the following criteria to be included as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having a pituitary mass </li>
    <li>Enrolled patients &amp;ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Either enrolled exclusively nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) patients OR combined the results of patients with NFPAs and functioning pituitary adenomas and/or other pituitary masses with &amp;ge;90% of the patients having NFPAs </li>
    <li>Was a full article report of a clinical study </li>
    <li>If a prospective case series, reported baseline values </li>
    <li>Appeared in a peer-reviewed publication </li>
    <li>Enrolled &amp;ge;10 NFPA patients per arm per intervention (20 total) for each outcome </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was published in or after 1966 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles of the following types were excluded as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In vitro studies </li>
    <li>Studies performed on cadavers </li>

<p>A multidisciplinary task force comprised of physician volunteers and evidence-based medicine trained methodologists conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). The physician volunteers represented neurosurgeons, neuro-ophthalmologists, neuroradiologists, and endocrinologists with expertise in pituitary adenomas. The evidence-based medicine trained methodologists had previous experience in guidelines production for the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). During the development process, the task force participated in a series of conference calls and meetings. Multiple iterations of written review were conducted by the individuals of the panel and various CNS/AANS Committees prior to approval.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Task Force Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force panel included context experts from multiple disciplines and various areas of therapy to address the topics addressed in this guideline. Sub-task force members were assigned to a specific chapter and were involved in the literature review, the creation and editing of the evidence tables, reviewing and voting of the final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Voting on the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used a structured voting technique to finalize and approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of recommendations, presented in this review. The voting technique is referred to as the nominal group technique. This technique includes up to three rounds of voting, using secret ballots to ensure task force members are blinded to the responses of other task force members. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. During the course of editing and finalization of the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described above. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p></div>"/>

<p>This clinical systematic review and evidence-based guideline was developed by a physician volunteer task force as an educational tool that reflects the current state of knowledge at the time of completion. The presentations are designed to provide an accurate review of the subject matter covered. This guideline is disseminated with the understanding that the recommendations by the authors and consultants who have collaborated in its development are not meant to replace the individualized care and treatment advice from a patient's physician(s). If medical advice or assistance is required, the services of a physician should be sought. The recommendations contained in this guideline may not be suitable for use in all circumstances. The choice to implement any particular recommendation contained in this guideline must be made by a managing physician in light of the situation in each particular patient and on the basis of existing resources.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Limitations</strong></span></p>
<p>This review of the literature revealed no Class I data concerning nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and visual findings, although conducting a double blinded randomized control trial would be very difficult to undertake due to the strict criteria surrounding such a trial and the nature of the disease and variations in the time at which patients are diagnosed. The non-comparative case series that were identified also lacked sufficient duration of follow-up or sufficient rigorous quantitative assessment to be considered Class II evidence based on the definitions utilized. For example, many studies failed to report their method of assessing visual acuity, and even fewer emphasized the importance of best corrected acuity to avoid contamination with other visual reasons for decreased acuity. Often, visual function is said to return to &quot;normal&quot; without criteria. Very few papers had all patients seen by an ophthalmologist, although this is likely a reflection of the challenges involved in making such arrangements. Many studies present cursory visual information while focusing on the safety of the reported treatment technique. When mentioned, acuity improvement has been stated as &quot;significant&quot; with a one-line improvement in function. Authors suggest the use of uncorrected visual acuity.</p>
<p>Another challenge is finding a quantitative means of assessing extrafoveal (visual field) visual function. There is often no data on distinguishing homonymous from &quot;quadrantic&quot; defects. Some studies have reported visual fields based initially on confrontation with quantitative data only on follow-up Other retrospective studies include patients with only confrontation or near vision data. While most recent studies now utilize automated static perimetry, some still report Goldmann perimetry, and even when using automated fields there is no universal agreement on the platform used and even less agreement on comparing visual fields. Some authors have come up with their own scoring system for perimetry. Several studies report &quot;normalization&quot; or &quot;complete resolution&quot; of visual fields without defining criteria. Some studies have suggested minimal changes in grey scale of automated perimetry to be significant.</p></div>"/>
