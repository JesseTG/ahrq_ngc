	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the overall quality of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, or <strong>insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that clinicians prescribe metformin to patients with type 2 diabetes when pharmacologic therapy is needed to improve glycemic control. (<strong>Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Metformin is effective in reducing glycemic levels, is associated with weight loss and fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and is cheaper than most other pharmacologic agents. Although the evidence was considered low quality, metformin may have an advantage over sulfonylurea monotherapy in terms of cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, unless contraindicated, metformin is the drug of choice for patients with type 2 diabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification.</p>
<p>As defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), metformin is contraindicated in patients with decreased tissue perfusion or hemodynamic instability, advanced liver disease, alcohol abuse, acute unstable congestive heart failure, or any condition that might lead to lactic acidosis. However, the FDA recently concluded that metformin is safe in patients with mild kidney impairment and in some patients with moderate kidney impairment (but is contraindicated in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate &amp;lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: ACP recommends that clinicians consider adding a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a sodium&amp;ndash;glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor to metformin to improve glycemic control when a second oral therapy is considered. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence</strong>.) ACP recommends that clinicians and patients select among medications after discussing benefits, adverse effects, and costs.</p>
<p>Combination therapies with metformin were more effective than metformin monotherapy in reducing hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels, weight, and blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. This recommendation is graded as weak because of the fine balance between benefits and harms for the various drug combinations. See Table 2 in the original guideline document for a summary of the comparative benefits and harms of metformin combination therapies as well as the adverse effects and cost of each medication. The evidence review did not include therapies combining more than 2 agents. Combination therapies also were associated with an increased risk for adverse effects compared with monotherapy.</p>
<p>Sulfonylureas have been used for many years and are the least expensive oral agent to add to metformin. However, sulfonylureas, both alone and combined with other agents, are associated with an increased risk for mild, moderate, or severe hypoglycemia as well as weight gain. The evidence review did not address medication switching for patients currently taking sulfonylureas. Regarding patients whose glycemic levels are adequately controlled and who do not have adverse effects with sulfonylureas, keeping them on this drug may be reasonable.</p>
<p>The SGLT-2 inhibitors are favored over sulfonylureas as an add-on to metformin therapy in terms of cardiovascular mortality, HbA1c, weight, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate and are favored over DPP-4 inhibitors as an add-on to metformin therapy in terms of weight and systolic blood pressure. As an add-on to metformin therapy, DPP-4 inhibitors are favored over sulfonylureas for long-term all-cause mortality, long-term cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular morbidity; over pioglitazone for short-term cardiovascular morbidity; and over sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones for weight.</p>
<p>Each class of drugs is associated with adverse effects, which are summarized in Table 2 of the original guideline document. The FDA warned that the DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin and alogliptin may increase the risk for heart failure, especially in patients who already have heart or kidney disease. The SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk for genital mycotic infections. Sulfonylureas are associated with an increased risk for hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>Although this guideline addresses only oral pharmacologic therapy, patients with persistent hyperglycemia despite oral agents and lifestyle interventions may need insulin therapy.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definition</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategy included terms for the diabetes medications of interest and terms for type 2 diabetes. Appendix Table 1 of the systematic review provides the MEDLINE search strategy.</p>
<p>The reviewers ran the search developed for the prior review with the date restrictions of April 2009 through March 2015. They ran an additional search that included the Medical Subject Heading terms and text words for all of the new medications included in this update, without any date restrictions. After completion of the evidence report, reviewers searched MEDLINE through December 2015, and updated their findings where the strength of evidence changed from low or insufficient to moderate or high.</p>
<p>The reviewers hand-searched the reference lists of all newly included articles and relevant systematic reviews. In addition, they searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant registered trials and reviewed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site for any unpublished additional studies relevant to the topic as part of the gray-literature search.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for inclusion and resolved differences through consensus. They included English language studies of nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes that evaluated at least 3 months of use of a diabetes medication or drug combination of interest. The reviewers included head-to-head monotherapy comparisons of metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium&amp;ndash;glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists; comparisons of metformin alone with a metformin-based combination; and comparisons of metformin-based combinations where the second medication was one of the monotherapies described above or a basal or premixed insulin (refer to Appendix Table 2 of the systematic review). They excluded studies that did not specify adjunctive medications. They excluded acarbose because of its infrequent use and the absence of new key studies that would substantially change the conclusions from the original report.</p>
<p>The reviewers included randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated all-cause mortality, macrovascular outcomes, microvascular outcomes, intermediate outcomes, or safety. They also included observational studies that adequately accounted for confounding, although not for the intermediate outcomes.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of Quality of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose&amp;ndash;response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction, Quality, and Applicability Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Using standardized forms, reviewers extracted information on the general study and participant characteristics, interventions, comparisons, and the outcome results. A second reviewer confirmed the abstracted data.</p>
<p>Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias in individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by using the criteria of Jadad and colleagues, as in the prior review. They used the Downs and Black tool for assessment of the risk of bias for the nonrandomized trials and observational studies. To assess study applicability, they evaluated whether the study population, interventions, outcomes, and settings were similar to usual care for people with type 2 diabetes in the United States.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers created a set of detailed evidence tables. They conducted meta-analyses when data were sufficient (from at least 3 trials) and studies were sufficiently homogenous with respect to key variables (population characteristics, study duration, and medication dosing). When a trial had more than 1 study group, they included in the quantitative pooling the study group with drug doses and study durations most similar to the other studies for that comparison and outcome.</p>
<p>The reviewers pooled the mean difference between groups for continuous outcomes and calculated pooled odds ratios for the dichotomous outcomes using the intention-to-treat denominator. They evaluated the heterogeneity among the trials by using the <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic. The reviewers generated summary treatment effects with the random-effects model estimated by using the DerSimonian and Laird method in settings of low heterogeneity (<em>I<sup>2</sup></em> &amp;lt;50%) and the profile likelihood estimate in settings of high heterogeneity (<em>I<sup>2</sup></em> &amp;ge;50%).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Adapting an evidence grading scheme recommended in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) guide for conducting comparative effectiveness reviews, 2 reviewers sequentially graded the studies' limitations, consistency, directness, precision, and potential reporting bias for the evidence on each outcome and comparison. The reviewers graded the evidence separately for RCTs and observational studies. The final evidence grade and conclusion were based on the RCTs and could be strengthened by evidence from observational studies with few study limitations. High strength of evidence indicates that the evidence probably reflects the true effect; moderate strength indicates that further research may change the result; and low strength indicates low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect, and further research is very likely to change the result. Insufficient evidence indicates that evidence is unavailable or the body of evidence has unacceptable deficiencies, precluding a conclusion.</p></div>"/>
