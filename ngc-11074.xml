	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the ratings of overall strength of evidence and recommendation categories are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conclusions and Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>A summary of the findings of this evidence-based review of urine culture preanalytics can be found in Table 15 in the original guideline document. Conclusions are categorized as &quot;recommended,&quot; &quot;not recommended,&quot; or &quot;no recommendation for or against&quot; and refer to studies of urine collected by noninvasive methods:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>No recommendation for or against is made for delayed processing of urine that is stored at room temperature, refrigerated, or preserved in boric acid due to insufficient evidence. Data from nine studies receiving a &quot;fair&quot; quality rating suggest that both refrigeration and boric acid adequately preserve urine specimens for up to 24 hours prior to their being processed. Furthermore, data from three studies receiving a &quot;fair&quot; quality rating suggest that urine held at room temperature for more than 4 hours should not be processed due to overgrowth of both clinically significant and contaminating flora. However, because the overall strength of the body of evidence was rated as low, no recommendation for or against can be made due to insufficient evidence. This does not preclude the use of refrigeration or chemical preservatives in clinical practice. It does indicate, however, that more systematic studies evaluating the utility of these measures are needed. </li>
    <li>If noninvasive collection is being considered for women, midstream collection with cleansing is recommended, but no recommendation for or against is made for midstream collection without cleansing due to insufficient evidence. Data from two studies, including one randomized controlled trial receiving a &quot;good&quot; quality rating and three studies receiving a &quot;fair&quot; quality rating, show that contamination rates are similar between specimens obtained by midstream collection with and without cleansing. The overall strength of this body of evidence was rated as high. However, whether midstream collection can be routinely used in place of straight catheterization is unclear. Data from three studies, two with a quality rating of &quot;fair&quot; and one with a rating of &quot;good,&quot; suggest that clean-catch midstream urine collection is highly accurate for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women; however, because the overall strength of this body of evidence was rated as low, no recommendation for or against can be made. </li>
    <li>If noninvasive collection is being considered for men, midstream collection with cleansing is recommended and collection of first-void urine is not recommended. No recommendation for or against is made for collection of midstream urine without cleansing due to insufficient evidence. Data from two studies, one with a quality rating of &quot;good&quot; and one with a rating of &quot;fair,&quot; found a large reduction in the level of contamination in specimens obtained by midstream collection with cleansing compared to the level of contamination after collection of first-void urine. This body of evidence was rated as high. Although data from one study rated as &quot;good&quot; quality found no difference in contamination between midstream urine collected with and that collected without cleansing, imprecision was largely due to the small event size, and no recommendation can be made as to which method is superior. Whether midstream collection can be used routinely in place of straight catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is unclear. Data from two studies receiving a &quot;fair&quot; quality rating suggest that midstream collection with cleansing is highly accurate for the diagnosis of UTIs in men; however, because the overall strength of the body of evidence was rated as low, no recommendation for or against can be made. </li>
    <li>If noninvasive collection is being considered for children, midstream collection with cleansing is recommended and collection with sterile urine bags, from diapers, or midstream without cleansing is not recommended. Data from six studies, two with a quality rating of &quot;good&quot; and four rated as &quot;fair,&quot; found large reductions in contamination in midstream clean-catch urine specimens compared to contamination after other noninvasive methods of collection. This body of evidence was rated as high. Whether midstream collection with cleansing can be routinely used in place of catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is unclear. Data from eight studies, two with a quality rating of &quot;good&quot; and six rated as &quot;fair,&quot; suggest that midstream collection with cleansing is accurate for the diagnosis of UTIs in infants and children and that midstream collection with cleansing has higher average accuracy than sterile urine bag collection (data for diaper collection was lacking). However, the overall strength of evidence was low, as multivariate modeling could not be performed; thus, no recommendation for or against can be made due to insufficient evidence. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall Strength of Evidence Ratings*</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel rates the overall strength of the body of evidence in support of the practice and it is categorized as High, Moderate, Suggestive, and Insufficient as defined.</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: Adequate volume of consistent evidence of substantial healthcare quality impact from studies without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Some evidence of consistent substantial healthcare quality impact from studies without major limitations; OR an adequate volume of consistent evidence of moderate healthcare quality impact from studies without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: Limited evidence of moderate healthcare quality impact from a small number of studies without major limitations; OR the quality of some studies' design and/or conduct is limited.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient</strong>: Any estimate of an effect on healthcare quality impact is too uncertain.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*These rating categories have their basis in the work of Guyatt et al.; they were modified to reflect both the quality of the evidence and effect size observed, rather than attempting to anticipate the impact of future potential evidence. The modified definitions for these categories are modeled after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Categories</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommend</strong>: High or moderate for improving healthcare quality. The practice should be identified as a &quot;best practice&quot; for implementation in appropriate care settings, taking into account variations and applicability in implementation and/or care settings.</p>
<p><strong>No recommendation for or against</strong>: Suggestive or insufficient. A potentially favorable impact on healthcare quality is not of sufficient size, or not sufficiently supported by evidence to indicate that it should be identified as a &quot;best practice&quot; for implementation in appropriate care settings.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend against</strong>: High or moderate for adversely affecting healthcare quality. The practice should not be identified as a &quot;best practice&quot; for implementation because it is not likely to result in more good than harm.</p></div>"/>

<p>The search for studies of practice effectiveness was conducted to identify those with measurable outcomes collected to the rigor of review requirements. With input from the expert panel and assistance of a research librarian at the Jesse Jones Library at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, TX, a literature search strategy and set of terms were developed. A search of three electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL) for English language articles published between 1965 and 2014 was conducted. In addition, hand searching of bibliographies from relevant information sources was performed. All search results were catalogued and maintained using a Web-based, commercial reference software package (RefWorks; ProQuest LLC, Ann Arbor, MI). Finally, solicitation of unpublished quality improvement studies was attempted by posting requests for data on both the Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Web site (<a href=&quot;https://wwwn.cdc.gov/futurelabmedicine/&quot; title=&quot;CDC LMBP Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://wwwn.cdc.gov/futurelabmedicine/</a>) and two listservs supported by the American Society for Microbiology: clinmicronet (<a href=&quot;http://www.asm.org/index.php/online-community-groups/listservs&quot; title=&quot;ASM Clinmicronet Web site&quot;>http://www.asm.org/index.php/online-community-groups/listservs</a>) and DivCNet (<a href=&quot;http://www.asm.org/division/c/divcnet.htm&quot; title=&quot;ASM DivCNet Web site&quot;>http://www.asm.org/division/c/divcnet.htm</a>).</p>

<p>Titles and abstracts were initially screened by the review coordinator, with assistance from the expert panel when necessary, to select studies for a full review. A study was included if it was considered likely to provide valid and useful information and met the PICO criteria previously discussed. Specifically, these inclusion criteria required that a study (i) address a defined population/definable group of patients, (ii) evaluate a specific intervention/practice included in this review, (iii) describe at least one finding for a relevant outcome measure (percent contamination, diagnostic accuracy) reproducible in comparable settings, and (iv) present results in a format which was useful for statistical analysis. Studies failing to meet the inclusion criteria (not considered to report a relevant practice, did not include a practice of interest, or did not present an outcome measure of interest) were excluded from further review.</p>
<p>Search results produced 5,092 unique documents that were initially screened for eligibility to contribute to evidence of effectiveness for practices defined by the eight clinical questions posed (storage and preservation of urine, collection of urine from women, collection of urine from men, and collection of urine from infants and children). There was no response to requests for unpublished data. The reduction of studies through the screening process is detailed in Figure 2 in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Studies that cleared the initial screening were then abstracted and evaluated by the expert panel. For eligible studies, information on study characteristics, interventions, outcome measures, and findings of the study was extracted using a standardized form and assigned a quality rating derived from points awarded for meeting quality criteria. Individual quality ratings were based on four dimensions: study quality, practice effectiveness, defined outcome measure(s), and findings/results. The objective for rating individual study quality was to judge whether sufficient evidence of practice effectiveness was available to support inclusion in an overall body of evidence for evaluation of a best-practice recommendation (that is, a practice likely to be effective in improving one or more outcomes of interest in comparison to other commonly used practices).</p>
<p>The four study quality dimensions were rated separately, with a rating score assigned up to the maximum for a given dimension. The rating scores for all four dimensions were added to reach a single summary score reflecting overall study quality. A total of 10 points were available for each study. Reviewers assigned one of three quality ratings to each study: good (8 to 10 points), fair (5 to 7 points), or poor (4 points or less). Each study was reviewed and rated by two expert panel members to minimize subjectivity and bias. Any study ranked as poor by one reviewer but good by the second reviewer was assigned to a third expert panel member for resolution. More detail on the rating process of individual studies can be found elsewhere (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field and additional references the original guideline document). Studies that did not meet a study quality rating of fair or good were excluded from further consideration. Data from published studies that passed a full review were transformed to a standardized, common metric according to Laboratory Medicine Best Practices (LMBP) methods. Summary data and quality scores for each publication included in this evidence-based review can be found in Appendix 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The study quality ratings and results from the individual studies for each clinical question were aggregated into bodies of evidence. The consistency of effects and patterns of effects across studies and the rating of overall strength of the body of evidence (high, moderate, low, suggestive, and insufficient) were based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Estimates of effect and the strength of the body of evidence were then used to translate results into one of three evidence-based recommendations (recommend, no recommendation for or against, recommend against). The ratings criteria are described in greater detail elsewhere (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>While recommendations are based on the entire body of evidence, meta-analyses to generate summary estimates of effect were undertaken for outcomes that provided sufficient data for measurements of diagnostic accuracy and contamination, i.e., proportions of specimens containing periurethral, perianal, epidermal, or vaginal flora. For the outcome of contamination proportion, summary odds ratios were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel methods in a random-effects model performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software version 5.0 (2008; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, DK). A contamination event was defined according to how individual studies defined contamination because definitions varied between studies. Wherever possible, contamination proportions were determined for the entire test population rather than a subset population (such as only among those individuals that tested negative for urinary tract infection). The <em>I</em>&amp;sup2; statistic, which describes the percentage of variability in effects estimates due to statistical heterogeneity rather than sampling error, was used to assess between-study heterogeneity. For the outcomes of diagnostic accuracy, it was planned that point estimates of sensitivity and specificity would be summarized using the bivariate model when similar cutoff points were used; however, all models failed to converge due to a too-small number of study or sample sizes. Similarly, hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curves (HSROC) could not be generated because these models too failed to converge. Solutions for failure of convergence, including removing individual studies, were explored but did not improve convergence. Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy outcomes and curve fitting were not pursued further given the limitations of univariate methods. All work on summarizing diagnostic accuracy outcomes was performed using SAS software version 9.2 (2008; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and the MetaDAS macro, version 1.3. Significant growth (i.e., a positive sample) was defined according to how each individual study defined significant growth because cutoff points tended to vary among studies. All other growth, including contamination and no growth, were considered nonsignificant growth (i.e., a negative sample), as this most closely reflects actual clinical practice. Two-by-two tables were used to determine sensitivity and specificity, and exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated.</p></div>"/>

Poorly collected or preserved specimens can become easily contaminated with perineal, vaginal, and periurethral flora, which can inhibit or obscure the presence of true urinary tract pathogens. Conversely, the use of high concentrations of boric acid as a preservative has been known to inhibit urinary pathogens such as <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. Midstream urine collection may be the preferred choice for collection for most patients; however, there are patient populations and clinical scenarios where a more invasive method of collection is preferred. All of these issues can produce incorrect culture results, misdiagnosis, especially in asymptomatic patients, poor patient management, including the use of inappropriate or ineffective antibiotics, and potentially more complicated urinary tract infection in the long term.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Future Research Needs</span></strong></p>
<p>The findings of this systematic review highlight the lack of recent high-quality studies that evaluate components of the preanalytical phase of urine culture. For example, the relative paucity of rigorous studies evaluating methods of storage and chemical preservation of urine specimens is troublesome considering the widespread use of these practices in many laboratories and a general consensus among microbiologists as to their benefit. A large number of the studies suffered from small sample sizes, limiting the precision of the results and reducing the likelihood that findings are applicable across a larger population. Studies also used various or unclear definitions of contamination or positivity thresholds, making meta-analysis or qualitative summary analysis problematic. Studies further suffered from missing data. For example, most studies were cross-sectional or otherwise observational (without randomization) in design, but many, particularly those retrospective in nature, did not obtain or report the results of samples from all patients obtained by all collection methods under study. These inconsistencies lead to significantly uneven comparison groups in some cases.</p>

<p>The methods of specimen collection and handling covered in the review are feasible in all settings and patient populations and are, in fact, commonly used in most medical environments today. There are data showing the benefit of either refrigerating or chemically preserving urine samples that are not immediately processed. Furthermore, midstream urine collection, with or without cleansing, is common practice for most clinical settings and patient populations. For facilities that have historically paid little attention to the preanalytic aspects of urine culture, there may be some resistance on the part of patients and staff that is typically associated with quality improvement initiatives. Appropriate education regarding the proper collection of urine specimens may be needed for both patients and health care workers. The additional costs associated with chemical preservatives, such as boric acid, would also need to be budgeted and justified.</p></div>"/>
