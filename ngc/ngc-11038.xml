	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1</span></strong> </p>
<p>In adult patients with colonic obstruction (malignant or benign) (P), should surgery (I) or endoscopic stenting (C) be performed to decrease mortality (O)? </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>PICO Question 2</span></strong> </p>
<p>In adult patients with colonic obstruction (malignant or benign) (P), should surgery (I) or endoscopic stenting (C) be performed to decrease emergency, nonplanned procedures (O)? </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations</span></strong> </p>
<p>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma <strong>conditionally recommends</strong> endoscopic, colonic stenting (if available) as the initial therapy for colonic obstruction. In their review, stent use was associated with decreased mortality and rates for emergency, nonplanned procedures to include reoperations. This conditional recommendation is limited to those with malignancy because of the lack of literature supporting this practice in benign colonic disease. Moreover, their review supports expedient intervention when the diagnosis of colonic obstruction is made because of the high complication and mortality rates associated with ischemic perforation (see Figure 6 in the original guideline document). </p>

<p><strong>Study Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published in the English language reporting adult patients 18 years or older, who required hospitalization for the management of colonic obstruction with surgery or endoscopic stenting. The reviewers excluded meta-analyses, case reports, letters, and reviews lacking original data. </p>
<p><strong>Intervention and Comparators</strong> </p>
<p>The reviewers only included studies directly comparing stenting with emergency, nonplanned surgery. </p>
<p><strong>Critical Outcome</strong> </p>
<p>As per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, outcomes were chosen by the team and rated in importance from 1 to 9, with scores of 7 to 9 representing critical outcomes after intervention for colonic obstruction. The critical outcome was mortality, rated a score of 9. </p>
<p><strong>Secondary Outcome</strong> </p>
<p>Emergency, nonplanned procedures were selected as a secondary outcome because of a rated score of 7. Other outcomes considered but excluded were renal failure, length of stay, and hospital cost because of ratings of lower than 7.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sources</strong></p>
<p>Two professional librarians conducted a systematic search using the PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases of published studies. The search was last run on January 2, 2015, and used the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms: ((&quot;Stents&quot;[Mesh] OR stent*[tiab]) OR (&quot;surgery&quot;[tiab] OR surgical*[tiab] OR &quot;surgery&quot; [Subheading: NoExp] OR &quot;Digestive System Surgical Procedures&quot;[Mesh])) AND ((&quot;Colon&quot;[Majr] OR &quot;colon&quot;[tiab] OR &quot;colonic&quot;[tiab]) AND (&quot;Intestinal Obstruction&quot;[Mesh:NoExp] OR obstruct*[tiab])) AND (&quot;mortality&quot; [Subheading] OR &quot;mortality&quot;[tiab] OR death*[tiab] OR survival[tiab]) AND (&quot;Comparative Study&quot; [Publication Type] OR compare*[tiab] OR compari*[tiab]). In addition to the electronic search, the reviewers hand-searched the bibliographies of recent reviews and articles accepted for this study and reviewed the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. All studies found from 1990 until the last date of the search were considered. The last search was performed in January 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Studies</strong></p>
<p>After completing the electronic literature search, two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, applying the a priori Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) inclusion criteria. Any disagreement on inclusion was resolved by consensus. The resulting studies then underwent full-text review, again by two independent reviewers, to determine appropriateness for inclusion.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Initially, the search yielded 210 studies. Title-only review excluded 102 articles. Abstract review excluded another 71 articles, leaving 37 articles for full-text review. Of those 37 articles, 6 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These RCTs were included in the final qualitative review (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document for a CONSORT diagram detailing the search and included articles in the review). The reviewers were unable to find literature that addressed stent use in benign disease; however, they included two articles focusing on benign disease for the qualitative review. </p>
<p>Finally, they identified four studies that were appropriate for quantitative synthesis for Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1 and two studies for PICO Question 2.</p></div>"/>

<p>Two independent reviewers extracted the desired variables from the studies into Microsoft Excel. For two meta-analyses, the reviewers used Review Manager X.6 (RevMan a program developed for The Cochrane Collaboration to assist authors in preparing Cochrane reviews for publication in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Measures of Treatment Effect</span></strong> </p>
<p>The reviewers reported the dichotomous outcomes of mortality and need for emergency, nonplanned operation as an odds ratio, with associated 95% confidence intervals and <em>p</em> values. The unit of analysis was individual patients. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessment of Heterogeneity</strong></span></p>
<p>Potential heterogeneity exists because of population differences, different types of surgery performed, and how obstruction was defined. The reviewers examined these differences across studies to assess the clinical and methodological heterogeneity. For the meta-analyses, they used RevMan to calculate the Q statistic, and then, the <em>I</em>&amp;sup2; statistic (%) was used to determine the proportion of variation between studies attributable to heterogeneity and categorized as low (25%-49%), moderate (50%-74%), or high (74%-100%). They also used the &amp;chi;<sup>2</sup> test for heterogeneity and examined the confidence intervals for overlap, with decreasing overlap representing increasing heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was moderate to high, they did not consider pooling the data to be appropriate, and they performed a qualitative narrative summary of results. Based on the methodological and clinical similarity, the reviewers performed meta-analysis for each outcome.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Qualitative Analysis and Quantitative <strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Analysis</span></strong> (Meta-Analysis)</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to the outcome of reduced mortality rates and for unplanned procedures or reoperations found no serious risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, or publication bias. However, studies comparing the rate of mortality for stent use versus surgery in patients with colonic obstruction included patients with only a malignant etiology for obstruction. No articles compared these techniques as applied to benign disease. All included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, the overall quality of evidence was downgraded to low secondary to the small number of studies fulfilling criteria, serious imprecision, and the large variation in outcomes.</p></div>"/>

Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider.
