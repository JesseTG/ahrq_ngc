	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

Please check the CDC's <a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/usspr.htm&quot; title=&quot;CDC Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Division of Reproductive Health Web site</a> for any changes that have been made to the recommendations since this guideline was published.</p>
<p>This document updates CDC's 2013 <em>U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use</em> (U. S. SPR), based review of the scientific evidence and consultation with national experts. Major updates include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Revised recommendations for starting regular contraception after the use of emergency contraceptive pills </li>
    <li>New recommendations for the use of medications to ease insertion of intrauterine devices </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>How to Use This Document</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations in this report are intended to help health care providers address issues related to use of contraceptives, such as how to help a woman initiate use of a contraceptive method, which examinations and tests are needed before initiating use of a contraceptive method, what regular follow-up is needed, and how to address problems that often arise during use, including missed pills and side effects such as unscheduled bleeding. Each recommendation addresses what a woman or health care provider can do in specific situations. For situations in which certain groups of women might be medically ineligible to follow the recommendations, comments and reference to <em>U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</em> (U.S. MEC) are provided. The full U.S. MEC recommendations and the evidence supporting those recommendations have been updated in 2016 and are summarized (see Appendix A in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The information in this document is organized by contraceptive method, and the methods generally are presented in order of effectiveness, from highest to lowest. However, the recommendations are not intended to provide guidance on every aspect of provision and management of contraceptive method use. Instead, they incorporate the best available evidence to address specific issues regarding common, yet sometimes complex, clinical issues. Each contraceptive method section generally includes information about initiation of the method, regular follow-up, and management of problems with use (e.g., usage errors and side effects). Each section first provides the recommendation and then includes comments and a brief summary of the scientific evidence on which the recommendation is based. The level of evidence from the systematic reviews for each evidence summary are provided based on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force system, which includes ratings for study design (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field), and categorization of the evidence as direct or indirect for the specific review question.</p>
<p>Recommendations in this document are provided for permanent methods of contraception, such as vasectomy and female sterilization, as well as for reversible methods of contraception, including the copper-containing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD); levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (LNG-IUDs); the etonogestrel implant; progestin-only injectables; progestin-only pills (POPs); combined hormonal contraceptive methods that contain both estrogen and a progestin, including combined oral contraceptives (COCs), a transdermal contraceptive patch, and a vaginal contraceptive ring; and the standard days method (SDM). Recommendations also are provided for emergency use of the Cu-IUD and emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).</p>
<p>For each contraceptive method, recommendations are provided on the timing for initiation of the method and indications for when and for how long additional contraception, or a back-up method, is needed. Many of these recommendations include guidance that a woman can start a contraceptive method at any time during her menstrual cycle if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant. Guidance for health-care providers on how to be reasonably certain that a woman is not pregnant is provided.</p>
<p>For each contraceptive method, recommendations include the examinations and tests needed before initiation of the method. These recommendations apply to persons who are presumed to be healthy. Those with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances. Most women need no or very few examinations or tests before initiating a contraceptive method although they might be needed to address other noncontraceptive health needs. Any additional screening needed for preventive health care can be performed at the time of contraception initiation, and initiation should not be delayed for test results. The classification system was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and adopted by CDC to categorize the applicability of the various examinations or tests before initiation of contraceptive methods (refer to the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>The classifications focus on the relation of the examinations or tests to safe initiation of a contraceptive method. They are not intended to address the appropriateness of these examinations or tests in other circumstances. For example, some of the examinations or tests that are not deemed necessary for safe and effective contraceptive use might be appropriate for good preventive health care or for diagnosing or assessing suspected medical conditions. Systematic reviews were conducted for several different types of examinations and tests to assess whether a screening test was associated with safe use of contraceptive methods. Because no single convention exists for screening panels for certain diseases, including diabetes, lipid disorders, and liver diseases, the search strategies included broad terms for the tests and diseases of interest.</p>
<p>Summary charts and clinical algorithms that summarize the guidance for the various contraceptive methods have been developed for many of the recommendations, including when to start using specific contraceptive methods (see Appendix B in the original guideline document), examinations and tests needed before initiating the various contraceptive methods (see Appendix C in the original guideline document), routine follow-up after initiating contraception (see Appendix D in the original guideline document), management of bleeding irregularities (see Appendix E in the original guideline document), and management of IUDs when users are found to have pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (see Appendix F in the original guideline document). These summaries might be helpful to health care providers when managing family planning patients. Additional tools are available on the <a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/USSPR.htm&quot; title=&quot;CDC Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations (SPR) Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Contraceptive Method Choice</span></strong></p>
<p>Many elements need to be considered individually by a woman, man, or couple when choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method. Some of these elements include safety, effectiveness, availability (including accessibility and affordability), and acceptability. Although most contraceptive methods are safe for use by most women, U.S. MEC provides recommendations on the safety of specific contraceptive methods for women with certain characteristics and medical conditions; a U.S. MEC summary (see Appendix A in the original guideline document) and the categories of medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use (see Box 1 in the original guideline document) are provided.</p>
<p>Voluntary informed choice of contraceptive methods is an essential guiding principle, and contraceptive counseling, where applicable, might be an important contributor to the successful use of contraceptive methods.</p>
<p>Contraceptive method effectiveness is critically important in minimizing the risk for unintended pregnancy, particularly among women for whom an unintended pregnancy would pose additional health risks. The effectiveness of contraceptive methods depends both on the inherent effectiveness of the method itself and on how consistently and correctly it is used (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). Both consistent and correct use can vary greatly with characteristics such as age, income, desire to prevent or delay pregnancy, and culture. Methods that depend on consistent and correct use by clients have a wide range of effectiveness between typical use (actual use, including incorrect or inconsistent use) and perfect use (correct and consistent use according to directions). IUDs and implants are considered long-acting, reversible contraception (LARC); these methods are highly effective because they do not depend on regular compliance from the user. LARC methods are appropriate for most women, including adolescents and nulliparous women. All women should be counseled about the full range and effectiveness of contraceptive options for which they are medically eligible so that they can identify the optimal method.</p>
<p>In choosing a method of contraception, dual protection from the simultaneous risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) also should be considered. Although hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STDs, including HIV. Consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for HIV infection and other STDs, including chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, and trichomoniasis. Although evidence is limited, use of female condoms can provide protection from acquisition and transmission of STDs. All patients, regardless of contraceptive choice, should be counseled about the use of condoms and the risk for STDs, including HIV infection. Additional information about prevention and treatment of STDs is available from the <em>CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines</em>.</p>
<p>Women, men, and couples have increasing numbers of safe and effective choices for contraceptive methods, including LARC methods such as IUDs and implants, to reduce the risk for unintended pregnancy. However, with these expanded options comes the need for evidence-based guidance to help health care providers offer quality family planning care to their patients, including assistance in choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method for individual circumstances and using that method correctly, consistently, and continuously to maximize effectiveness. Removing unnecessary barriers can help patients access and successfully use contraceptive methods. Several medical barriers to initiating and continuing contraceptive methods might exist, such as unnecessary screening examinations and tests before starting the method (e.g., a pelvic examination before initiation of COCs), inability to receive the contraceptive on the same day as the visit (e.g., waiting for test results that might not be needed or waiting until the woman's next menstrual cycle to start use), and difficulty obtaining continued contraceptive supplies (e.g., restrictions on number of pill packs dispensed at one time). Removing unnecessary steps, such as providing prophylactic antibiotics at the time of IUD insertion or requiring unnecessary follow-up procedures, also can help patients access and successfully use contraception.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>How to Be Reasonably Certain That a Woman Is Not Pregnant</span></strong></p>
<p>In most cases, a detailed history provides the most accurate assessment of pregnancy risk in a woman who is about to start using a contraceptive method. Several criteria for assessing pregnancy risk are listed in the recommendation that follows. These criteria are highly accurate (i.e., a negative predictive value of 99% to 100%) in ruling out pregnancy among women who are not pregnant. Therefore, CDC recommends that health care providers use these criteria to assess pregnancy status in a woman who is about to start using contraceptives (see box below). If a woman meets one of these criteria (and therefore the health care provider can be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant), a urine pregnancy test might be considered in addition to these criteria (based on clinical judgment), bearing in mind the limitations of the accuracy of pregnancy testing. If a woman does not meet any of these criteria, then the health care provider cannot be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant, even with a negative pregnancy test. Routine pregnancy testing for every woman is not necessary.</p>
<p>On the basis of clinical judgment, health care providers might consider the addition of a urine pregnancy test; however, they should be aware of the limitations, including accuracy of the test relative to the time of last sexual intercourse, recent delivery, or spontaneous or induced abortion. Routine pregnancy testing for every woman is not necessary. If a woman has had recent (i.e., within the last 5 days) unprotected sexual intercourse, consider offering emergency contraception (either a Cu-IUD or ECPs) if pregnancy is not desired.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Intrauterine Contraception</span></strong></p>
<p>Four IUDs are available in the United States, the copper-containing IUD and three levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (containing a total of either 13.5 mg or 52 mg levonorgestrel). Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 becomes pregnant in the first year of using IUDs (with typical use). IUDs are long-acting, are reversible, and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents, and by parous and nulliparous women. IUDs do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about initiation of Cu-IUDs and LNG-IUDs, examinations and tests needed before initiation of a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD, and other issues regarding IUD contraception is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Implants</span></strong></p>
<p>The etonogestrel implant, a single rod with 68 mg of etonogestrel, is available in the United States. Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 becomes pregnant in the first year of use of the etonogestrel implant with typical use. The implant is long acting, is reversible, and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents. The implant does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about initiation of implants, examinations and tests needed before implant insertion, and other issues regarding implant contraception is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Injectables</span></strong></p>
<p>Progestin-only injectable contraceptives (depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA], 150 mg intramuscularly or 104 mg subcutaneously) are available in the United States; the only difference between these two formulations is the route of administration. Approximately 6 out of 100 women will become pregnant in the first year of use of DMPA with typical use. DMPA is reversible and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents. DMPA does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about initiation of injectables, examinations and tests needed before initiation of an injectable, and other issues regarding injectable contraception is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Combined Hormonal Contraceptives</span></strong></p>
<p>Combined hormonal contraceptives contain both estrogen and a progestin and include 1) COCs (various formulations), 2) a transdermal contraceptive patch (which releases 150 &amp;mu;g of norelgestromin and 20 &amp;mu;g ethinyl estradiol daily), and 3) a vaginal contraceptive ring (which releases 120 &amp;mu;g etonogestrel and 15 &amp;mu;g ethinyl estradiol daily). Approximately 9 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year of use with combined hormonal contraceptives with typical use. These methods are reversible and can be used by women of all ages. Combined hormonal contraceptives are generally used for 21 to 24 consecutive days, followed by 4 to 7 hormone-free days (either no use or placebo pills). These methods are sometimes used for an extended period with infrequent or no hormone-free days. Combined hormonal contraceptives do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives, examinations and tests needed before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives, and other issues regarding combined hormonal contraceptives is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Progestin-Only Pills</span></strong></p>
<p>POPs contain only a progestin and no estrogen and are available in the United States. Approximately 9 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year of use with POPs with typical use. POPs are reversible and can be used by women of all ages. POPs do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about initiation of POPs, examinations and tests needed before initiation of POPs, and other issues regarding POPs is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Standard Days Method</span></strong></p>
<p>SDM is a method based on fertility awareness; users must avoid unprotected sexual intercourse on days 8 to 19 of the menstrual cycle. Approximately 5 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year of use with perfect (i.e., correct and consistent) use of SDM; effectiveness based on typical use is not available for this method but is expected to be lower than that for perfect use. SDM is reversible and can be used by women of all ages. SDM does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about use of SDM among women with various durations of the menstrual cycle is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Emergency Contraception</span></strong></p>
<p>Emergency contraception consists of methods that can be used by women after sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Emergency contraception methods have varying ranges of effectiveness depending on the method and timing of administration. Four options are available in the United States: the Cu-IUD and three types of ECPs.</p>
<p>Information about types of emergency contraception, initiation of emergency contraception, advance provision of ECPs, and other issues regarding emergency contraception is available in the original guideline document. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Female Sterilization</span></strong></p>
<p>Laparoscopic, abdominal, and hysteroscopic methods of female sterilization are available in the United States, and some of these procedures can be performed in an outpatient procedure or office setting. Fewer than 1 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year after female sterilization. Because these methods are intended to be irreversible, all women should be appropriately counseled about the permanency of sterilization and the availability of highly effective, long-acting, reversible methods of contraception. Female sterilization does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about when female sterilization is reliable for contraception is available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Male Sterilization</span></strong></p>
<p>Male sterilization, or vasectomy, is one of the few contraceptive methods available to men and can be performed in an outpatient procedure or office setting. Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 becomes pregnant in the first year after her male partner undergoes sterilization. Because male sterilization is intended to be irreversible, all men should be appropriately counseled about the permanency of sterilization and the availability of highly effective, long-acting, reversible methods of contraception for women. Male sterilization does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.</p>
<p>Information about when male sterilization is reliable for contraception and other postprocedure recommendations are available in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>When Women Can Stop Using Contraceptives</span></strong></p>
<p>Contraceptive protection is still needed for women aged &amp;gt;44 years if the woman wants to avoid pregnancy.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed all of the existing recommendations in the 2013 <em>U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use</em> (U.S. SPR) for new evidence identified by continuous identification of research evidence (CIRE) that had the potential to lead to a changed recommendation. During August 27&amp;ndash;28, 2014, CDC held a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, of 11 family planning experts and representatives from partner organizations to solicit their input on the scope of and process for updating both the 2010 <em>U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</em> (U.S. MEC) and the 2013 U.S. SPR. The participants were experts in family planning and represented different provider types and organizations that represent health care providers. A list of participants is provided at the end of the original guideline document. The meeting related to topics to be addressed in the update of U.S. SPR based on new scientific evidence published since 2013 (identified though the CIRE system), topics addressed at a 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) meeting to update global guidance, and suggestions CDC received from providers for the addition of recommendations not included in the 2013 U.S. SPR (e.g., from provider feedback through e-mail, public inquiry, and questions received at conferences). CDC identified one topic to consider adding to the guidance: the use of medications to ease intrauterine device (IUD) insertion (evidence question: &quot;Among women of reproductive age, does use of medications before IUD insertion improve the safety or effectiveness of the procedure [ease of insertion, need for adjunctive insertion measures, or insertion success] or affect patient outcomes [pain or side effects] compared with nonuse of these medications?&quot;). CDC also identified one topic for which new evidence warranted a review of an existing recommendation: initiation of regular contraception after emergency contraceptive pills (evidence question: &quot;Does ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception interact with regular use of hormonal contraception leading to decreased effectiveness of either contraceptive method?&quot;). CDC determined that all other recommendations in the 2013 U.S. SPR were up to date and consistent with the current body of evidence for that recommendation.</p>
<p>During August 26&amp;ndash;28, 2015, CDC held a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, of 29 participants who were invited to provide their individual perspectives on the scientific evidence presented and to discuss potential recommendations that followed. Participants represented a wide range of expertise in family planning provision and research and included obstetrician/gynecologists, pediatricians, family physicians, nurse practitioners, epidemiologists, and others with research and clinical practice expertise in contraceptive safety, effectiveness, and management. Lists of participants and any potential conflicts of interest are provided at the end of the original guideline document. During the meeting, the evidence from the systematic review for each topic was presented, including direct evidence and any indirect evidence or theoretical concerns. Participants provided their perspectives on using the evidence to develop the recommendations that would meet the needs of U.S. health care providers. After the meeting, CDC determined the recommendations in this report, taking into consideration the perspectives provided by the meeting participants.</p></div>"/>

Bleeding irregularities, including amenorrhea, commonly occur with implants, injectables, and other hormonal contraceptive methods. </li>
    <li>Risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place during pregnancy. Theoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD); however, whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown. A systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (including spontaneous abortion, septic abortion, preterm delivery, and chorioamnionitis) compared with women who had their IUDs removed or who did not have an IUD. Copper-containing IUD (Cu-IUD) removal decreased risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD. One case series examined LNG-IUDs. When they were not removed, eight in 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions. </li>
    <li>Theoretically, IUD insertion could induce bacterial spread and lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or infective endocarditis. A meta-analysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials examining antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no treatment for IUD insertion. Use of prophylaxis reduced the frequency of unscheduled return visits but did not significantly reduce the incidence of PID or premature IUD discontinuation. Although the risk for PID was higher within the first 20 days after insertion, the incidence of PID was low among all women who had IUDs inserted. In addition, the American Heart Association recommends that the use of prophylactic antibiotics solely to prevent infective endocarditis is not needed for genitourinary procedures. Studies have not demonstrated a conclusive link between genitourinary procedures and infective endocarditis or a preventive benefit of prophylactic antibiotics during such procedures. </li>
    <li>Although hormonal contraceptives can have some adverse effects on glucose metabolism in healthy and diabetic women, the overall clinical effect is minimal. </li>
    <li>Women taking combined estrogen and progestin emergency contraception pills (ECPs) are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting than those who take levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate (UPA)&amp;nbsp;ECPs.</li>
    <li>Health-care providers should consider the risks for becoming pregnant in a woman of advanced reproductive age, as well as any risks of continuing contraception until menopause. Pregnancies among women of advanced reproductive age are at higher risk for maternal complications, such as hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism, and death, and fetal complications, such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomalies. Risks associated with continuing contraception, in particular risks for acute cardiovascular events (venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or stroke) or breast cancer, also are important to consider. </li>
    <li>Figure 1 in the original guideline document shows the unintended pregnancy rate (within first year of typical use) for individual contraceptive methods. </li>
    <li>The U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2016 (U.S. MEC) focuses on who can safely use specific methods of contraception and provides recommendations on safe use of contraceptive methods for women with various medical conditions and other characteristics (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) and characteristics (e.g., age, parity, and smoking status). See Appendix A in the original guideline document for a summary chart of the U.S. MEC. </li>
    <li>Evidence for misoprostol from two systematic reviews, including a total of 10 randomized controlled trials, suggests that misoprostol does not improve provider ease of insertion, reduce the need for adjunctive insertion measures, improve insertion and might increase patient pain and side effects. </li>
    <li>For methods requiring a visit to a health care provider, such as DMPA, implants, and IUDs, starting the method at the time of UPA use may be considered; the risk that the regular contraceptive method might decrease the effectiveness of UPA must be weighed against the risk of not starting a regular hormonal contraceptive method. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is committed to working with partners at the federal, national, and local levels to disseminate, implement, and evaluate <em>U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use 2016</em> (U.S. SPR) recommendations so that the information reaches health care providers. Strategies for dissemination and implementation include collaborating with other federal agencies and professional and service organizations to widely distribute the recommendations through presentations, electronic distribution, newsletters, and other publications; development of provider tools and job aids to assist providers in implementing the new recommendations; and training activities for students, as well as for continuing education. CDC conducts surveys of family planning health care providers to assess attitudes and practices related to contraceptive use. Results from these surveys will assist CDC in evaluating the impact of these recommendations on the provision of contraceptives in the United States. Finally, CDC will continually monitor new scientific evidence and will update these recommendations as warranted by new evidence. Updates to the recommendations, as well as provider tools and other resources, are available on the <a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/USSPR.htm&quot; title=&quot;CDC Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>CDC U.S. SPR Web site</a>.</p></div>"/>
