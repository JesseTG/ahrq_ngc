	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>These recommendations represent guidance from the ACS for women at average risk of breast cancer: women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (e.g., <em>BRCA</em>), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.</p>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation</em></strong>)

        <li>Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually. (<strong><em>Qualified Recommendation</em></strong>) </li>
        <li>Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually. (<strong><em>Qualified Recommendation</em></strong>) </li>
        <li>Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years. (<strong><em>Qualified Recommendation</em></strong>) </li>

    <li>Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer. (<strong><em>Qualified Recommendation</em></strong>) </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American Cancer Society (ACS) Guideline Development Group (GDG) selected the Duke University Evidence Synthesis Group to conduct an independent systematic evidence review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) of the breast cancer screening literature, after a response to a request for proposals. In addition, the ACS commissioned the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) to update previously published analyses related to the screening interval and outcomes. The ACS Surveillance and Health Services Research Program provided supplementary data on disease burden using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Parameters of Review</span></strong></p>
<p>With input from the ACS and GDG, the reviewers developed specific key questions (KQs) relevant to breast cancer screening and specified patients, interventions, comparators outcomes, timing, and settings (PICOTS) for each question (see Box 1 in the original guideline document). In their review, they focused on the results for women at &quot;average&quot; risk for breast cancer, defined as the absence of a known susceptibility gene mutation (e.g., <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em>); history of previous breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); family history of breast cancer; or history of lobular neoplasia, proliferative lesions on prior biopsy, or chest irradiation. Abstracts and full-text articles were screened for descriptions of the subject population and excluded if women at higher risk were either exclusively included or explicitly included but results not reported separately. Population-based studies that did not report results separately were not excluded. The review reports on results for KQ 1 (mammography screening vs no screening), KQ 2 (mammography screening at different intervals), and KQ 3 (clinical breast examination [CBE] with or without mammography). The review identified almost no evidence relevant to KQ 4 (screening vs no screening in women at high risk of breast cancer) or KQ 5 (screening at different intervals for high-risk women). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched PubMed (to March 6, 2014), CINAHL (to September 10, 2013), and PsycINFO (to September 10, 2013). No earlier date limit was used for randomized clinical trials (RCTs); for observational studies, the group searched for all citations published after January 1, 2000. &quot;Gray literature&quot; was not searched nor were attempts made to identify unpublished studies. An experienced search librarian advised on all searches. Exact search strings are included in in eAppendix 1 in the systematic review supplement (eTables 1, 2, and 3). Hand searches of 4 systematic reviews of RCTs and 3 systematic reviews of observational studies were performed to ensure that all these studies were included. All citations were imported into an electronic database (EndNote X4; Thomson Reuters) that was also used for recording screening decisions and data extraction.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers developed specific inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Box 2 in the systematic review) that were used by 2 investigators to independently review titles and abstracts for potential relevance to the KQs. Articles included by either reviewer underwent full-text screening. At the full-text review stage, paired researchers independently reviewed the articles and indicated a decision to &quot;include&quot; or &quot;exclude&quot; the article for data abstraction. When the 2 reviewers arrived at different decisions about whether to include or exclude an article, they reconciled the difference through review and discussion, or through a third-party arbitrator if needed. Full-text articles meeting the eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American Cancer Society (ACS) Guideline Development Group (GDG) selected the Duke University Evidence Synthesis Group to conduct an independent systematic evidence review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) of the breast cancer screening literature, after a response to a request for proposals.

The ACS Surveillance and Health Services Research Program provided supplementary data on disease burden using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.</p>
<p>Prior to the review, the GDG had agreed to use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess quality of evidence and resulting certainty or uncertainty about benefit and harm to formulate specific recommendations. Decisions about which outcomes were &quot;critical&quot; in the context of GRADE (e.g., all false-positive results vs false-positive biopsy results) were made by the GDG.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Abstraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on clinical and methodological expertise, a pair of investigators were assigned to abstract data from each eligible article. One investigator abstracted the data, and the second reviewed the completed abstraction form alongside the original article to check for accuracy and completeness. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by obtaining a third reviewer's opinion if consensus could not be reached. In addition to specific study characteristics, individual study limitations (risk of bias) were rated using a 4-point scale from very low to high quality using the GRADE methodology.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Qualitative Evidence Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers summarized results and methodological limitations of included studies, noted qualitative patterns or inconsistencies, and identified common themes and potential explanations for observed patterns or inconsistencies.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quantitative Evidence Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>Four high-quality systematic reviews or meta-analyses published within the past 4 years have synthesized the available data, particularly for breast cancer mortality, and have reported roughly similar results. Prior to beginning their review, the Evidence Synthesis Group planned to conduct a new meta-analysis only if any additional literature was substantially different in results from previous studies or would substantively improve the ability to grade the quality of evidence for a particular outcome (because it would substantially improve the precision of the estimate of association with harm or benefit). As of March 6, 2014, no updated evidence from included studies, new evidence from other studies, or new evidence for outcomes not amenable to quantitative synthesis in previous reviews (such as overdiagnosis) were identified, and it was judged that additional meta-analyses would not substantially help the GDG resolve uncertainties about the evidence.</p>
<p>Absolute associations of screening (particularly mortality reduction and cumulative false-positive rates) were estimated using both the results of simulation-based modeling reported in the literature and results of simpler models (see eAppendix 2 in the systematic review supplement). Published population-based data on incidence, mortality, and survival, screening prevalence, and estimates of false-positive outcome were used. To estimate the absolute reduction in mortality associated with screening over 15 years, the reviewers used an approach similar to that of a previous model (see eAppendix 2 in the systematic review supplement), based on estimates of prevalence of screening, the mortality reduction associated with screening (across a wide range of estimates), and observed mortality. However, in contrast to the previous approach, the reviewers used age-specific incidence-based mortality rather than age-specific mortality. Because breast cancer deaths at a given age reflect cases diagnosed both at that age and younger ages, estimating the effects of screening using this approach will not capture the potential effect of screening prior to the beginning of a given age interval (for example, applying a given risk reduction associated with mammography to 50- to 59-year-old women will include deaths attributable to cancer diagnosed prior to age 50 years). Using incidence-based mortality results in somewhat lower estimates of number needed to screen (NNS), compared with age-specific mortality at a given estimate of screening effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Overall Quality Rating</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers graded the overall quality of the body of evidence for each outcome per Key Question (KQ) based on the specific criteria outlined by GRADE (see eAppendix 1 in the systematic review supplement [eTables 5 and 6]). There is no explicit &quot;formula&quot; for grading strength of evidence when data are available from both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, particularly when, as is the case with breast cancer screening, differences exist in the magnitude of association across different study designs and factors other than study internal validity or risk of bias, such as secular trends in incidence, screening technology, and treatment effectiveness, may influence the applicability of the evidence to the population of interest. For each outcome per KQ, the Evidence Synthesis Group provided an assessment of the overall strength of evidence across all included study designs by assessing 4 domains: (1) risk of bias (graded primarily by study design, with RCTs having the lowest risk of bias, and, within study designs, by factors such as method of randomization, adequacy of adjustment for potential confounding, and plausible direction of unmeasured confounding); (2) consistency (graded primarily on consistency in the direction of association&amp;mdash;e.g., did studies consistently show a reduction in breast cancer mortality across a range of study designs and settings); (3) directness (graded based on whether the study directly measured the outcome of interest, rather than a direct measure of a surrogate or an estimate of the outcome based on the modeling of surrogates, and by applicability to screening as currently practiced in the United States); and (4) precision, which primarily affected the estimate of the magnitude (strength) of association&amp;mdash;for example, it would be possible for evidence for a particular outcome to be considered high quality in terms of consistency if all studies showed the same direction of association (e.g., decreased breast cancer mortality) but low quality for the magnitude of association if results varied substantially within or across study designs or settings. If available, results from meta-analyses were used when evaluating consistency (forest plots, tests for heterogeneity), precision (confidence intervals), and strength of association (weighted mean difference). These domains were considered qualitatively, and a summary rating of high, moderate, low, or very low strength of evidence was assigned after discussion by 2 investigators using a 4-level scale from high to very low. Any disagreement was resolved through consensus.</p>
<p>Much of the available evidence on the outcomes of specific screening strategies, particularly for the United States, is derived from published studies of simulation modeling. GRADE does not provide explicit guidance on how to weight modeling studies. Even the most sophisticated modeling study will be limited by the strength of the evidence available for the most important parameters. In general, because modeling is often most useful for addressing questions for which direct evidence is difficult to obtain (comparing a large number of different screening intervals and starting and stopping ages), and because virtually all models require assumptions or imputed values (such as the progression rate of undetected cancer) to produce usable results (such as estimates of cancer deaths prevented). Therefore, the Evidence Synthesis Group assumed that modeling studies could be no higher than moderate quality. As part of the total body of evidence, modeling studies raised quality if they contributed to improved consistency of results (e.g., if model-based estimates of mortality reduction were consistent with observational studies that were not used to provide inputs into the model).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Process</span></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with the new guideline development process, the American Cancer Society (ACS) organized an interdisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) consisting of clinicians (n=4), biostatisticians (n=2), epidemiologists (n=2), an economist (n=1), and patient representatives (n=2). After evaluating available methods to grade the evidence and the strength of recommendations, the GDG selected the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is an accepted approach with a defined analytic framework, an explicit consideration of values and preferences addressing patient-centered outcomes, the capacity for flexibility in evaluating results from observational studies, and separation between quality of evidence and strength of recommendation.</p>
<p>The ACS GDG selected the Duke University Evidence Synthesis Group to conduct an independent systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature, after a response to a request for proposals. This effort is referred to as the evidence review. In addition, the ACS commissioned the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) to update previously published analyses related to the screening interval and outcomes. The ACS Surveillance and Health Services Research Program provided supplementary data on disease burden using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.</p>
<p>The GDG deliberations on the evidence and framing of the recommendations were guided by the GRADE domains: the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, the diversity in women's values and preferences, and confidence in the magnitude of the effects on outcomes. The GDG chose to assess recommendations as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;qualified,&quot; in accordance with GRADE guidance. A strong recommendation conveys the consensus that the benefits of adherence to the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. Qualified recommendations indicate there is clear evidence of benefit but less certainty about either the balance of benefits and harms, or about patients' values and preferences, which could lead to different decisions (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>The GDG members voted on agreement or disagreement with each recommendation and on the strength of recommendation. A record of the vote with respect to each question was made without attribution. The panel attempted to achieve 100% agreement whenever possible, but a three-quarters majority was considered acceptable.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>There are invariably gaps between the available evidence and the evidence needed for the development of guidelines that precisely quantify and weigh the benefits vs the harms associated with breast cancer screening. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) synthesized evidence from a variety of sources, including the randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies of modern service screening, and modeling studies. Still, even after broadening the evidence base, gaps remain. Empirical comparisons of screening programs that differ in terms of their ages to start and stop screening, and in their intervals between screening examinations, generally were lacking. Further, most breast screening studies did not provide estimates of benefits and harms over a lifetime horizon, which is important when considering policies that will span several decades or more of an individual's lifetime. The value and applicability of meta-analysis of mammography screening RCTs to guide current health policy also should be kept in perspective. While the RCT evidence demonstrated the efficacy of mammography screening, these studies were conducted from the 1960s through the 1990s with varying protocols, most using older screen-film systems and often using single-view mammography. The RCTs demonstrated a range of outcomes in terms of mortality reductions and, importantly, in terms of the degree to which an invitation to screening was associated with a reduced risk of being diagnosed with an advanced breast cancer, which is strongly associated with reduced breast cancer mortality. Overall and age-specific mortality reduction estimates derived from meta-analysis of intention-to-treat results do not reveal these differences in the performance of the trials. In addition, RCT estimates based on intention-to-treat analyses are influenced by nonadherence to the protocol by both the invited and control group. In these respects, meta-analysis results are a sound basis for judging the efficacy of mammography screening, but a poor basis for estimating the effectiveness of modern high-quality screening, especially when calculating absolute benefits and harms. </p>
