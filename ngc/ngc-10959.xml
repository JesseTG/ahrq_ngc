	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (+OOO, ++OO, +++O, and ++++); the strength of the recommendation (1 or 2); the difference between a &quot;recommendation&quot; and a &quot;suggestion,&quot; and the definition of &quot;best practice statements&quot; are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Who Should Be Tested and How?</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends diagnostic testing to exclude primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) in acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of PAI (volume depletion, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fever, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation or, especially in children, hypoglycemia). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends confirmatory testing with the corticotropin stimulation test in patients with clinical symptoms or signs suggesting PAI when the patient's condition and circumstance allow. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with severe adrenal insufficiency symptoms or adrenal crisis, the Task Force recommends immediate therapy with intravenous (iv) hydrocortisone at an appropriate stress dose prior to the availability of the results of diagnostic tests. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Optimal Diagnostic Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests the standard dose (250 &amp;mu;g for adults and children &amp;ge;2 y of age, 15 &amp;mu;g/kg for infants, and 125 &amp;mu;g for children &amp;lt;2 y of age) iv corticotropin stimulation (30 or 60 min) test over other existing diagnostics tests to establish the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 &amp;mu;g/dL) (assay dependent) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests the low-dose (1 &amp;mu;g) corticotropin test for diagnosis of PAI only when the substance itself is in short supply. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>If a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible, the Task Force suggests using a morning cortisol &amp;lt;140 nmol/L (5 &amp;mu;g/dL) in combination with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (until confirmatory testing with corticotropin stimulation is available). (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measurement of plasma ACTH to establish PAI. The sample can be obtained at the same time as the baseline sample in the corticotropin test or paired with the morning cortisol sample. In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH &amp;gt;2-fold the upper limit of the reference range is consistent with PAI. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends the simultaneous measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone in PAI to determine the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that the etiology of PAI should be determined in all patients with confirmed disease. (For diagnostic workup, see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the original guideline document.) (<strong>Ungraded best practice recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment of Primary Adrenal Insufficiency in Adults</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Glucocorticoid Replacement Regimen</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends glucocorticoid therapy in all patients with confirmed PAI. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests using hydrocortisone (15&amp;ndash;25 mg) or cortisone acetate (20&amp;ndash;35 mg) in two or three divided oral doses per day; the highest dose should be given in the morning at awakening, the next either in the early afternoon (2 h after lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and afternoon (three-dose regimen). Higher frequency regimens and size-based dosing may be beneficial in individual cases. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>As an alternative to hydrocortisone, the Task Force suggests using prednisolone (3&amp;ndash;5 mg/d), administered orally once or twice daily, especially in patients with reduced compliance. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against using dexamethasone for the treatment of PAI because of risk of Cushingoid side effects due to difficulties in dose titration. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests monitoring glucocorticoid replacement using clinical assessment including body weight, postural blood pressure, energy levels, signs of frank glucocorticoid excess. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against hormonal monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement and to adjust treatment only based on clinical response. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Mineralocorticoid Replacement in PAI </strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that all patients with confirmed aldosterone deficiency receive mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone (starting dose, 50&amp;ndash;100 &amp;mu;g in adults) and not restrict their salt intake. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends monitoring mineralocorticoid replacement primarily based on clinical assessment (salt craving, postural hypotension, or edema), and blood electrolyte measurements. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients who develop hypertension while receiving fludrocortisone, the Task Force suggests reducing the dose of fludrocortisone. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the Task Force suggests initiating antihypertensive treatment and continuing fludrocortisone. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Dehydroepiandrosterone Replacement</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests a trial of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement in women with PAI and low libido, depressive symptoms, and/or low energy levels despite otherwise optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests an initial period of 6 months of DHEA replacement. If the patient does not report a sustained, beneficial effect of replacement after 6 months, the DHEA should be discontinued. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests monitoring DHEA replacement by measuring morning serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) levels (aiming at the midnormal range) before the intake of the daily DHEA replacement dose. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment during Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that pregnant patients with PAI be monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid over- and under-replacement (e.g., normal weight gain, fatigue, postural hypotension or hypertension, hyperglycemia), with at least one review per trimester. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that, based on the individual clinical course, an increase in hydrocortisone dose should be implemented, in particular during the third trimester. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>In pregnant women with PAI, The Task Force suggests using hydrocortisone over cortisone acetate, prednisolone, or prednisone (<strong>2|++OO</strong>) and recommend against using dexamethasone because it is not inactivated in the placenta. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends hydrocortisone stress dosing during the active phase of labor, similar to that used in major surgical stress. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment and Monitoring during Childhood</strong></p>
<p>In children with PAI, the Task Force suggests treatment with hydrocortisone in three or four divided doses (total starting daily dose of 8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area) over other types of glucocorticoid replacement therapies, with doses adjusted according to individual need. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>In children with PAI, the Task Force suggests avoiding synthetic, long-acting glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone). (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests monitoring glucocorticoid replacement by clinical assessment, including growth velocity, body weight, blood pressure, and energy levels. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>In children with PAI and confirmed aldosterone deficiency, the Task Force recommends treatment with fludrocortisone (starting dosage, 100 &amp;mu;g/d). For infants, the Task Force recommends sodium chloride supplements in the newborn period and up to the age of 12 months. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Management and Prevention of Adrenal Crisis in Patients with PAI</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with an immediate parenteral injection of 100 mg (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for children) hydrocortisone, followed by appropriate fluid resuscitation and 200 mg (50&amp;ndash;100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for children) of hydrocortisone/24 hours (via continuous iv therapy or 6 hourly injection); age- and body surface-appropriate dosing is required in children (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>If hydrocortisone is unavailable, the Task Force suggests prednisolone as an alternative. Dexamethasone is the least-preferred alternative and should only be given if no other glucocorticoid is available. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For the prevention of adrenal crisis, the Task Force suggests adjusting glucocorticoid dose according to severity of illness or magnitude of the stressor. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests patient education concerning glucocorticoid adjustments in stressful events and adrenal crisis-prevention strategies including parenteral self- or lay-administration of emergency glucocorticoids. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that all patients should be equipped with a steroid emergency card and medical alert identification to inform health personnel of the need for increased glucocorticoid doses to avert or treat adrenal crisis and the need of immediate parenteral steroid treatment in the event of an emergency. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that every patient should be equipped with a glucocorticoid injection kit for emergency use and be educated on how to use it. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Additional Monitoring Requirement</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that adults and children with PAI be seen by an endocrinologist or a healthcare provider with endocrine expertise at least annually. Infants should be seen at least every 3 to 4 months. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that PAI patients be evaluated annually for symptoms and signs of over- and under-replacement. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests periodic screening for autoimmune diseases known to be more prevalent in PAI patients in whom autoimmune origin of PAI has not been excluded. The optimal frequency of screening is unknown but can be done annually. These conditions include thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, premature ovarian failure, celiac disease, and autoimmune gastritis with vitamin B12 deficiency. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests patient education about increasing the dosage of glucocorticoids during intercurrent illness, fever, and stress. This education includes identification of precipitating symptoms and signs and how to act in impending adrenal crisis. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests genetic counseling for patients with PAI due to monogenic disorders. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>: In this guideline, the Task Force made several statements to emphasize various monitoring and patient education actions needed to prevent the severe morbidity and mortality of adrenal crisis and reduce medication side effects. These were labeled as ungraded best practice statements. Direct evidence for these statements was either unavailable or not systematically appraised and was considered out of the scope of this guideline. The intention of these statements is to draw attention and remind providers of these principles, and these statements should not be considered as graded recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>Study selection and data extraction were done in duplicate. Diagnostic estimates from included studies were pooled using the random effects model as implemented in Meta disc software package. See the full systematic review for details of the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p>Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies (QUADAS)-2 instrument, studies overall had moderate risk of bias. This conclusion is mainly driven by unclear or inappropriate patient selection and referral bias leading to high prevalence. Otherwise, the studies had low risk of bias in the domains of index test, reference standard, and flow and timing.</p>

<p><strong>Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p>Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomized control trials and the Newcastle Ottawa scale for observational studies. In summary, there was a moderate risk of bias in the included randomized controlled trials. There was incomplete data analysis in 3 studies and allocation was not concealed or unclear in all of the studies. The observational studies were generally of good quality and the authors tried to minimize the risk of bias. Samples were representative in most studies with no baseline imbalance; nearly all the studies adjusted for at least one important confounder and most of the studies had adequate follow up period. </p></div>"/>

    <li>Retrospective studies of patients taking higher doses of glucocorticoids in some cases, including prednisolone or dexamethasone, appear to show a tendency to adverse metabolic consequences including weight gain, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. </li>
    <li>Symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid over-replacement are weight gain, insomnia, and peripheral edema. Insufficient dosing is characterized by nausea, poor appetite, weight loss, lethargy, and hyperpigmentation. </li>
    <li>Signs and symptoms of inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement include poor weight gain, salt craving, dehydration, hyponatremia with hyperkalemia, and elevated plasma renin activity or concentration. Excessive mineralocorticoid replacement results in hypertension and suppressed plasma renin. </li>
    <li>Primary hypertension may also be present in primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). Assessment of the hypertensive PAI patient should involve an evaluation of not only the fludrocortisone dose but also the glucocorticoid dose because overtreatment with either preparation can lead to hypertension. </li>
    <li>Cortisone acetate may be used instead of hydrocortisone; however, caution should be used because 11&amp;beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity is variable in childhood, and it is uncertain whether the hydrocortisone dose equivalency used in adults applies in children. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict of interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before they are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict-of-interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (e.g., stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through the Endocrine Society office.</p>
