	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Mitral Valve Operations and Concomitant Surgical Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) can be performed without additional risk of operative mortality or major morbidity, and is recommended at the time of concomitant mitral operations to restore sinus rhythm. (<strong>Class I, Level A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Aortic Valve and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) Operations with Concomitant Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical ablation for AF can be performed without additional risk of operative mortality or major morbidity, and is recommended at the time of concomitant isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), isolated CABG, and AVR plus CABG operations to restore sinus rhythm. (<strong>Class I, Level B nonrandomized</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Stand-Alone Surgical Ablation for AF</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical ablation for symptomatic AF in the absence of structural heart disease that is refractory to class I/III antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter-based therapy is reasonable as a primary stand-alone procedure to restore sinus rhythm. (<strong>Class IIA, Level B randomized</strong>)</p>
<p>Surgical ablation for symptomatic persistent or long-standing persistent AF in the absence of structural heart disease is reasonable as a stand-alone procedure using the Cox-Maze III/IV lesion set compared with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone. (<strong>Class IIA, Level B nonrandomized</strong>)</p>
<p>Surgical ablation for symptomatic AF in the setting of left atrial enlargement (&amp;ge;4.5 cm) or more than moderate mitral regurgitation by PVI alone is not recommended. (<strong>Class III no benefit, Level C expert opinion</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Additional Considerations for Surgical Ablation Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>It is reasonable to perform left atrial (LA) appendage excision or exclusion in conjunction with surgical ablation for AF for longitudinal thromboembolic morbidity prevention. (<strong>Class IIA, Level C limited data</strong>)</p>
<p>At the time of concomitant cardiac operations in patients with AF, it is reasonable to surgically manage the LA appendage for longitudinal thromboembolic morbidity prevention (<strong>Class IIA, Level C expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary heart team assessment, treatment planning, and long-term follow-up can be useful and beneficial to optimize outcomes of surgical ablation for AF. (<strong>Class IIA, Level C expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classification of Strength of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> (strong; benefit &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; risk): procedure is useful, effective, and beneficial. Recommendation: procedure should be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Class IIA</strong> (moderate; benefit &amp;gt;&amp;gt; risk): procedure can be useful, effective, and beneficial. Recommendation: procedure is reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Class IIB</strong> (weak; benefit equal to or greater than risk): effectiveness is unknown, unclear, or uncertain. Recommendation: procedure might be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>, no benefit (moderate; benefit equals risk): procedure is not useful, effective, or beneficial. Recommendation: procedure should not be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>, harm (strong; benefit less than risk): Procedure potentially causes harm or excess mortality and morbidity. Recommendation: procedure should not be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong>: high-quality evidence from more than one randomized controlled trial (RCT); meta-analyses or high-quality RCTs; or one or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies.</p>
<p><strong>Level B randomized</strong>: moderate quality evidence from one or more RCTs or meta-analyses of moderate quality.</p>
<p><strong>Level B nonrandomized</strong>: moderate quality of evidence from one or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, registries, or observational analyses; meta-analyses of such studies.</p>
<p><strong>Level C limited data</strong>: randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution; meta-analyses of such studies; mechanistic or physiologic investigation in human subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Level C expert opinion</strong>: consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience. </p></div>"/>

<p>Literature searches focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, but also used registries, observational and descriptive studies, reviews, and expert opinion. Emphasis was placed on evidence that was relevant to important clinical questions.</p>
<p>Searches were accomplished in the Medline and EMBASE databases. Formal search results were limited to papers published on human subjects in English after January 1, 2004. The end date for the search was October 2015. The following search terms were used to identify relevant studies: exp Atrial Fibrillation, afib.mp, atrial fibrillation.mp, AF.mp, Surgical adj4 ablation.mp, cyroablation.mp, Ablation Techniques, Radiofrequency adj4 ablation.mp, Cox MAZE or Cox-MAZE.mp, RFA.mp, exp Microwaves, mortality.mp. or exp Mortality, exp Survival/ or Survival.mp, exp Stroke/ or Stroke.mp, Hemorrhage.mp. or exp Hemorrhage, bleeding.mp, heart failure.mp. or exp Heart Failure, exp Patient Readmission, readmission.mp, Heart Block.mp. or exp Heart Block, Reintervention.mp, exp Treatment outcome, exp Treatment failure, exp Recurrence, exp &quot;Quality of Life&quot;, exp Reoperation, and exp Pacemaker, Artificial.</p>
<p>The literature search was supplemented by manual examination of the identified studies. Abstracts were reviewed by at least three persons for relevance. A total of 1511 results were obtained, and papers were excluded if they were case reports, were population-based studies covering incidence and risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF), had a primary focus on nonsurgical procedures, or sought to identify potential outcomes or markers not within the focus of the guideline. The remaining 156 relevant articles were analyzed in detail by the writing group, and recommendations were reviewed and formulated by all members consistent with Institute of Medicine standards for guideline development.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Operative Safety of Surgical Ablation in Mitral Patients</span></strong></p>
<p>Using multivariable regression and propensity matching, a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database registry study demonstrated safety of surgical ablation concomitant to mitral surgery in a cohort made up of 52% mitral patients. Patients who underwent surgical ablation, however, had a 26% greater likelihood of requiring a permanent pacemaker (risk adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.49, p = 0.007). In a recent randomized trial of mitral valve surgery patients, the authors reported no increase in major operative risk with surgical ablation, but a twofold to threefold higher incidence of pacemaker implantation among patients undergoing ablation versus patients undergoing mitral valve surgery alone. The largest meta-analyses, which included any concomitant operation, however, reported no significant difference in permanent pacemaker implantation. Although influences on nonfatal complications are controversial, it is clear that concomitant ablation has not significantly increased risk of death or major complications.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Operative Safety of Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) or Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), or Both, with Surgical Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>A recent matched cohort analysis compared 124 patients from a single institution who underwent AVR with or without a concomitant maze procedure. No significant differences were observed in operative mortality and morbidity. Another cohort study of 124 patients also reported no significant difference in mortality and morbidity associated with AVR with or without CABG and concomitant surgical ablation. A 2014 randomized study compared both CABG plus a Cox maze procedure and CABG with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) to CABG alone and reported no in-hospital mortality.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Operative Safety of Stand-Alone Surgical Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>In a 2013 systematic review that compiled results from 23 observational studies with 752 patients who underwent minimally invasive stand-alone procedures, operative mortality was 0.4%. Complication rates attributed to surgery were just 3.2%. Analysis of stand-alone procedures recorded in the STS National Database showed an operative mortality rate of 0.74%. The complication rate was considerably higher at 16.43%, although major morbidities such as stroke (0.72%), renal failure (2.45%), and bleeding (0.99%) were low. Pacemakers were implanted in 1.03% of patients.</p></div>"/>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Several of the investigations classified as high-quality evidence documenting the safety endpoint of concomitant surgical ablation (SA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) at the time of primary mitral operations include occasional patients receiving additional secondary operative procedures. Although the majority of populations defined are weighted to persistent or longstanding persistent (nonparoxysmal) AF, occasional studies include mixed populations of paroxysmal AF patients, lending a degree of heterogeneity to the study populations. Finally, selection biases may be inherent to retrospective data that caution interpretation of such studies. </li>
    <li>The majority of evidence documenting the safety endpoint and rhythm efficacy endpoint of concomitant SA for primarily closed atrial procedures (isolated aortic valve replacement [AVR], coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], or AVR plus CABG) include patients receiving additional secondary operative procedures. Whereas the majority of populations defined are weighted to paroxysmal AF, many include persistent or longstanding persistent nonparoxysmal AF, lending a degree of inhomogeneity to the study populations. </li>
    <li>The majority of the studies comprising the evidence documenting the safety endpoint and rhythm efficacy endpoint of stand-alone SA for AF are of moderate quality as they include a variety of lesion sets and energy sources leading to technique variability. Although the majority of defined populations are weighted to paroxysmal AF, many include persistent or longstanding persistent (nonparoxysmal) AF, lending a degree of heterogeneity to the study populations. </li>
