	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid routine treatment with antibiotics, which may be inappropriate or ineffective treatment for a neck mass, thus leading to delayed diagnosis of malignancy or other serious illness.

    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Under treatment of a missed bacterial infection </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perception by the guideline development group (GDG) that antibiotics are common for noninfectious neck masses, delaying diagnosis and/or referral. Further perception that physical examination is the primary determinant of an infectious cause of a neck mass, and history is a secondary determinant. </li>

    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>

    <li>Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The risk of missing or delaying diagnosis of a malignancy in a patient who is at increased risk is more important than false-positive clinical diagnosis in a patient with nonmalignant disease.

    <li>Differences of opinion: GDG debated whether firm consistency of the mass is a predictor of malignancy (majority opinion: 14 of 18 felt that firmness is predictive of malignancy); GDG also debated whether absolute size of the mass, regardless of neck location, is a predictor of malignancy. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Statement 2c. Additional Suspicious Signs and Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for all adults with a neck mass to identify those patients with an increased risk for malignancy. </p>

    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on case series </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for increased-risk patients, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, psychological benefit of timely evaluation, facilitate further care </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The risk of missing or delaying diagnosis of malignancy in an increased-risk patient is more important than potentially misclassifying patients with nonmalignant disease. Assumption by the GDG that early identification of at-risk status with the initial history and physical examination can improve outcomes. Assumption by the GDG that the listed signs and symptoms can predict risk of cancer above and beyond lack of infectious etiology, &amp;ge;2 weeks' duration of mass, reduced mobility, firm texture, size &amp;gt;1.5 cm, ulceration. </li>

<p>The recommendations in this clinical practice guideline are based on systematic reviews identified by a professional information specialist using an explicit search strategy. Additional background evidence included randomized controlled trials and observational studies, as needed, to supplement the systematic reviews or to fill gaps when a review was not available. An information specialist conducted 2 systematic literature searches from December 2015 through February 2016 using a validated filter strategy to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and comparative studies. For a complete list of search terms, refer to the original guideline document. </p>
<p>The English-language searches were performed in multiple databases, including PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) UK, and Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase (Canada). In certain instances, targeted searches for lower-level evidence were performed to address gaps from the systematic searches identified in writing the guideline from April 2016 through November 2016. January 1980 was the beginning date for all of the searches.</p></div>"/>

The guideline development group (GDG) consisted of 21 panel members representing experts in advanced practice nursing, clinical pathology, consumer advocacy, emergency medicine, general practice medicine, general surgery, head and neck surgery and oncology, otolaryngology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, physician assistants, and radiology.</p>
<p>In a series of conference calls, the GDG defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 12 months devoted to guideline development ending in August 2016, the GDG met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, with use of decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) to facilitate the creation of actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft were used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). </p>
<p>The AAO-HNSF staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in September 2016 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating neck masses. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible clinician, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent practice variation is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline development group (GDG) sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>

<p>The clinical practice guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em>, which will facilitate reference and distribution.

Existing brochures and publication by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations. As a supplement to clinicians, an algorithm of the guideline's action statements has been provided (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The algorithm allows for a more rapid understanding of the guideline's logic and the sequence of the action statements.

<p>Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established &quot;stake&quot; in an issue.</p>
