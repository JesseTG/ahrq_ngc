<p><strong>Acute Dietary Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Provide aggressive nutrition management during illness or at first presentation to prevent or reverse catabolism and promote anabolism by supplying: adequate energy (up to 150% of usual energy intake); branched chain amino acids (BCAA)-free protein (increased to replace BCAA-containing intact protein); fluid (up to 150 mL/kg with careful monitoring of electrolytes and possible cerebral edema); and electrolytes and insulin (if needed). (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use parenteral nutrition alone (providing BCAA-free amino acids, lipids and/or glucose) or in conjunction with enteral feedings, when necessary to meet energy needs in severe illness. (<strong>B.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Include nutritional intervention when dialysis, hemoperfusion or similar treatment is necessary to lower plasma BCAA and remove toxic metabolites. (<strong>C.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Monitor BCAA, acid&amp;ndash;base balance, urine &amp;alpha;-ketoacids, blood glucose and clinical symptoms closely during illness. If hemofiltration or dialysis is necessary, blood gas, hematocrit, total protein, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, urea, and creatinine should also be monitored. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Add isoleucine (ILE) and valine (VAL), even if they are already in the 200&amp;ndash;400 &amp;mu;mol/L range, to help lower elevated plasma leucine (LEU) into the treatment range. (<strong>B.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Reintroduce intact protein (or complete amino acid mixtures) when elevated plasma LEU approaches the upper limit of the treatment range: 200 &amp;mu;mol/L for infants and children &amp;le;5 years of age; and 300 &amp;mu;mol/L for individuals &amp;gt;5 years of age. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider use of breast milk (mean LEU concentration of 1 mg/mL) as a source of intact protein (and BCAA) in the dietary management of infants with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) if there is frequent anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory monitoring of the infant and mother has adequate milk production. (<strong>D.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Manage mild illnesses with patient-specific sick-day instructions to include reduction of intact protein by 50% to 100% for 24 to 48 hours by replacement with additional BCAA-free medical food, adequate hydration, addition of non-protein energy sources, and close monitoring. (<strong>D.II</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Achieving Appropriate BCAA Blood Concentrations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Maintain plasma LEU concentrations, with frequent monitoring, between 75 and 200 &amp;mu;mol/L for infants and children &amp;le;5 years old and between 75 and 300 &amp;mu;mol/L for individuals &amp;gt;5 years of age to achieve favorable cognitive outcomes. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Maintain plasma ILE and VAL concentrations, with frequent monitoring, between 200 and 400 &amp;mu;mol/L (or slightly above the normal ranges) in all individuals to avoid metabolic instability and BCAA deficiencies. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Employ MSUD-specific dietary management strategies to achieve recommended BCAA concentrations. (<strong>A.I</strong>) (see Tables 3 and 4 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Maintain plasma BCAA within the recommended ranges throughout life. (<strong>C.II</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Thiamin Supplementation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Perform a thiamin challenge for all individuals with MSUD except those known to be homozygous for the 1312T&amp;gt;A mutation or other mutations resulting in less than 3% branched-chain &amp;alpha;-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme activity. (<strong>B.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Initiate a thiamin challenge with a dosage of 50&amp;ndash;200 mg/day. (<strong>C.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evaluate response to thiamin challenge over a one month period by assessing plasma BCAA and/or tolerance for dietary BCAA. (<strong>D.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Maintain thiamin supplementation and appropriate dietary BCAA restriction in thiamin-responsive individuals. (<strong>D.II</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and Postnatal Period in Women with MSUD</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Monitor closely and provide individualized dietary guidance to assure that intake is adequate to meet the increased protein, BCAA and energy requirements of pregnancy. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Maintain plasma BCAA concentrations in the normal (MSUD) treatment range (LEU: 75&amp;ndash;300 &amp;mu;mol/L; ILE and VAL: 200&amp;ndash;400 &amp;mu;mol/L) throughout pregnancy. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Treat pregnancy-related poor appetite, nausea and vomiting aggressively to prevent or minimize endogenous protein catabolism. See treatment strategies to prevent endogenous catabolism in Research Question 1 (see the &quot;Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence&quot; field). (<strong>A.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evaluate the need for vitamin and/or mineral supplementation based on the pregnant woman's prescribed medical food, dietary adherence and laboratory assessment. (<strong>D.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pay special attention to the prevention of catabolism during particularly vulnerable periods of labor/delivery and the first two weeks postpartum, as well as up to six weeks postpartum. (<strong>C.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Provide increased nutrient intake and close clinical and biochemical monitoring for the woman with MSUD who is breastfeeding. (<strong>D.I</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Liver Transplantation in Individuals with MSUD</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Consider liver transplantation as a viable treatment option for individuals with MSUD. (<strong>B.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Attempt to bring candidates for liver transplant into good metabolic control (prior to surgery) through dietary management of BCAA. (<strong>C.II</strong>) </li>
    <li>Prevent metabolic decompensation in the perioperative period. (<strong>B.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Allow relaxation of the BCAA-restricted diet and lift precautions for severe metabolic decompensation for individuals with MSUD who have had successful liver transplantation. (<strong>C.I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Provide nutrition counseling to assist in dietary transition, and monitor the anthropometric and nutritional status of individuals with MSUD who have had successful liver transplantation. (<strong>E.II</strong>) </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Search Process</strong></p>
<p>Because of the known scarcity of peer-reviewed scientific literature in nutrition management of inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), the search process included both published scientific studies and gray, or practice, literature.</p>
<p>For the peer-reviewed literature, medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were specific to each question, but inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same for all questions (see questions below). Eligibility for research questions was limited to human studies and published in English from 1985 to summer 2011 (except for the research question related to thiamin that used earlier references from 1971), with nutrition data included. There were no study-design, age or setting restrictions. PubMed was the primary database used. Searches were conducted by a research librarian. The titles and abstracts of identified articles were scanned for relevance and matched with inclusion/exclusion criteria by the workgroup. Excluded articles were noted and qualifying articles were gathered for review and abstracting. Reference lists within the identified articles were examined for additional resources. These were added if they contributed pertinent information.</p>
<p>Practice (or gray) literature sources, which are not accessible through standard search systems, include abstracts and presentations from scientific and practice-based meetings, clinical protocols and guidelines, unpublished research, communication among experts (including list-serves), professional newsletters, and book chapters. The search for gray literature involved requests to individuals (e.g., practitioners and researchers) and organizations through their professional list serves, as well as online searches for materials related to nutrition and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). Identified resources were screened and prioritized for inclusion based on relevance and substantive information not available in scientific literature, and currency.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Question Formulation</strong></p>
<p>The maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) workgroup consisted of eight experienced metabolic dietitians who began the process by independently identifying over 40 practice areas where uncertainty and/or variation in practice existed. These were categorized and prioritized. Five topics were identified for evidence analysis and guideline development. Research questions for each topic were formulated in the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) format.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Input and Evidence Summary</strong></p>
<p>Key information from all eligible evidence sources (scientific and gray literature) for each question was summarized on an evidence table. Many issues of concern to nutrition management were not addressed or were inconclusive from the combined sources. For these issues, expert input from nutrition and medical clinicians and researchers was sought using a Delphi survey, nominal group process meeting and a second-round Delphi survey. By systematically employing these techniques, the level of agreement with a specific practice statement was quantified. Also, input from the target population (patient and family) was included in the nominal group process. The final conclusion statement for each question represented a synthesis of evidence from scientific publications, gray literature, and Delphi and nominal group consensus techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development</strong></p>
<p>Specific recommendations for nutrition management in each of the five topic areas were derived from the summaries, and each recommendation was rated with respect to strength (A = strong, B = fair, C = weak, D = consensus, E = insufficient evidence) and need for clinical action (I = imperative or II = conditional). See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p>These practice recommendations along with background and other information to support their implementation are contained in the MSUD Nutrition Management Guideline document.</p></div>"/>
