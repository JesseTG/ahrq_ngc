	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
        <li>Immunocompetent individuals who live in a household with immunocompromised patients can safely receive inactivated vaccines based on the CDC&amp;ndash;ACIP's annually updated recommended vaccination schedules for children and adults (hereafter, CDC annual schedule; <strong>strong, high</strong>) or for travel (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>Individuals who live in a household with immunocompromised patients age &amp;ge;6 months should receive influenza vaccine annually (<strong>strong, high</strong>). They should receive either:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV; <strong>strong, high</strong>) or </li>
            <li>Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) provided they are healthy, not pregnant, and aged 2&amp;ndash;49 years (<strong>strong, low</strong>). Exceptions include individuals who live in a household with an immunocompromised patient who was a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipient within 2 months after transplant or with graft vs host disease (GVHD) or is a patient with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID).* In these exceptions, LAIV should not be administered (<strong>weak, very low</strong>) or, if administered, contact between the immunocompromised patient and household member should be avoided for 7 days (<strong>weak, very low</strong>). </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;8&quot;>
        <li>Healthy immunocompetent individuals who live in a household with immunocompromised patients should receive the following live vaccines based on the CDC annual schedule: combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>); rotavirus vaccine in infants aged 2&amp;ndash;7 months (<strong>strong, low</strong>); varicella vaccine (VAR; <strong>strong, moderate</strong>); and zoster vaccine (ZOS; <strong>strong, moderate</strong>). Also, these individuals can safely receive the following vaccines for travel: yellow fever vaccine (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) and oral typhoid vaccine (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) should <em>not </em>be administered to individuals who live in a household with immunocompromised patients (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>Highly immunocompromised patients should avoid handling diapers of infants who have been vaccinated with rotavirus vaccine for 4 weeks after vaccination (<strong>strong, very low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Immunocompromised patients should avoid contact with persons who develop skin lesions after receipt VAR or ZOS until the lesions clear (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
        <li>Clinicians may administer inactivated vaccines indicated for travel based on the CDC annual schedule for immunocompetent adults and children (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Yellow fever vaccine generally should <em>not</em> be administered to immunocompromised persons (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). If travel to an endemic area cannot be avoided, vaccination can be considered in the following minimally immunocompromised human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&amp;ndash;infected individuals:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Asymptomatic HIV-infected adults with CD4 T-cell lymphocyte count &amp;ge;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (<strong>weak, low</strong>) </li>

        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;14&quot;>
        <li>With certain exceptions (e.g., yellow fever vaccine and MMR vaccine in certain HIV-infected patients [see recommendation 13 and &quot;Recommendations for Vaccination of HIV-infected Adults, Adolescents, and Children&quot; section] and in certain HSCT patient [see &quot;Recommendations for Vaccination of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients&quot;]), live vaccines should not be given to immunocompromised persons (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations for Varicella and Zoster Vaccines in Immunocompromised Patients</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>VAR</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li><strong>Should Immunocompromised Patients or Those Scheduled to Receive Immune Suppressive Therapy Receive VAR?</strong>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;15&quot;>
        <li>VAR should be given to immunocompetent patients without evidence of varicella immunity (i.e., age-appropriate varicella vaccination, serologic evidence of immunity, clinician-diagnosed or -verified history of varicella or zoster, or laboratory-proven varicella or zoster; <strong>strong, moderate</strong>) if it can be administered &amp;ge;4 weeks before initiating immunosuppressive therapy (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>A 2-dose schedule of VAR, separated by &amp;gt;4 weeks for patients aged &amp;ge;13 years and by &amp;ge;3 months for patients aged 1&amp;ndash;12 years, is recommended if there is sufficient time prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapy (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>VAR should <em>not</em> be administered to highly immunocompromised patients. However, certain categories of patients (e.g., patients with HIV infection without severe immunosuppression or with a primary immune deficiency disorder without defective T-cell&amp;ndash;mediated immunity, such as primary complement component deficiency disorder or chronic granulomatous disease [CGD]) should receive VAR, adhering to a 2-dose schedule separated by a 3-month interval (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>VAR can be considered for patients without evidence of varicella immunity (defined in recommendation 16) who are receiving long-term, low-level immunosuppression (<strong>weak, very low</strong>).* </li>
        <li>VAR should be administered to eligible immunocompromised patients as the single antigen product, not VAR combined with MMR vaccine (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;88&quot;>
        <li>Living donors should be current with vaccines based on age, vaccination history, and exposure history according to the CDC annual schedule (<strong>strong, high</strong>); MMR, MMRV, VAR, and ZOS vaccine administration should be avoided within 4 weeks of organ donation (<strong>weak, very low</strong>). Vaccination of donors solely for the recipient's benefit is generally not recommended (<strong>weak, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Adults and children with chronic or end-stage kidney, liver, heart, or lung disease, including solid organ transplant (SOT) candidates, should receive all age-, exposure history-, and immune status-appropriate vaccines based on the CDC annual schedule for immunocompetent persons (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>Adult SOT candidates; adults with end-stage kidney disease; and pediatric patients who are SOT candidates; are aged &amp;lt;6 years and have end-stage kidney, heart, or lung disease; or are aged 6&amp;ndash;18 years and have end-stage kidney disease should receive PCV13 as in recommendations 27a-c (<strong>strong, very low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Adults and children aged &amp;ge;2 years who are SOT candidates or have end-stage kidney disease should receive PPSV23 if they have not received a dose within 5 years and have not received 2 lifetime doses (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). Patients with end-stage kidney disease should receive 2 lifetime doses 5 years apart (<strong>strong, low</strong>). Adults and children aged &amp;ge;2 years with end-stage heart or lung disease as well as adults with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, should receive a dose of PPSV23 if they have never received a dose (<strong>strong, low</strong>). When both PCV13 and PPSV23 are indicated, PCV13 should be completed 8 weeks prior to PPSV23 (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>Anti-HBs&amp;ndash;negative SOT candidates should receive the HepB vaccine series (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) and, if on hemodialysis and aged &amp;ge;20 years, they should receive the high-dose (40 &amp;mu;g) HepB vaccine series (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). If a postvaccination anti-HBs concentration of &amp;ge;10 mIU/mL is not attained, a second 3-dose series of HepB vaccine (<strong>strong, low</strong>; alternative: 1 dose of HepB vaccine after which anti-HBs is tested*) should be administered, using standard dose (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) or high dose* for children (<strong>weak, low</strong>) and high dose for adolescents* and adults (<strong>strong, low</strong>). HepA-unvaccinated, -undervaccinated, or -seronegative SOT candidates (particularly liver transplant candidates) aged 12&amp;ndash;23 months (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) and &amp;ge;2 years (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) should receive a HepA vaccine series. </li>
        <li>Combined HepA&amp;ndash;HepB vaccine can be used for SOT candidates aged &amp;ge;12 years of age* in whom both vaccines are indicated (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>The HPV vaccine series should be administered to SOT candidates aged 11&amp;ndash;26 years (<strong>strong, low-moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>SOT candidates aged 6&amp;ndash;11 months can receive MMR vaccine if they are not receiving immunosuppression and if transplantation is not anticipated within 4 weeks (<strong>weak, very low</strong>). If transplantation is delayed (and the child is not receiving immunosuppression), the MMR vaccine should be repeated at 12 months (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>The VAR should be administered to SOT candidates without evidence of varicella immunity (as defined in recommendation 16) if they are not receiving immunosuppression and if transplantation is not anticipated within 4 weeks (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). The VAR can be administered to varicella-naive SOT candidates aged 6&amp;ndash;11 months who are not immunosuppressed provided the timing is &amp;ge;4 weeks prior to transplant (<strong>weak, very low</strong>).* Optimally, 2 doses should be administered &amp;ge;3 months apart (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>SOT candidates aged &amp;ge;60 years (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) and varicella-positive candidates (as defined in recommendation 22) aged 50&amp;ndash;59 years (<strong>weak, low</strong>)* who are not severely immunocompromised should receive ZOS if transplantation is <em>not </em>anticipated within 4 weeks. </li>

        <li>Vaccination should be withheld from SOT recipients during intensified immunosuppression, including the first 2-month posttransplant period, because of the likelihood of inadequate response (<strong>strong, low</strong>). However, IIV can be administered &amp;ge;1 month after transplant during a community influenza outbreak (<strong>weak, very low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Standard age-appropriate inactivated vaccine series should be administered 2 to 6 months after SOT based on the CDC annual schedule (<strong>strong, low to moderate</strong>), including IIV (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>PCV13 should be administered 2 to 6 months after SOT if not administered before SOT, with the timing based on the patient's degree of immunosuppression, as described in recommendations 27a&amp;ndash;c (<strong>strong, very low to moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>For SOT patients aged &amp;ge;2 years, 1 dose of PPSV23 should be administered 2 to 6 months after SOT, with the timing based on the patient's degree of immunosuppression, and &amp;ge;8 weeks after indicated doses of PCV13, if not given within 5 years and if the patient has received no more than 1 previous lifetime dose (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>HepB vaccine should be considered for chronic HepB-infected recipients 2 to 6 months after liver transplant in an attempt to eliminate the lifelong requirement for HepB immune globulin (HBIG; <strong>weak, low</strong>).* </li>
        <li>MMR vaccine and VAR should generally <em>not</em> be administered to SOT recipients because of insufficient safety and effectiveness data (<strong>strong, low</strong>), except for varicella in children without evidence of immunity (as defined in recommendation 15) who are renal or liver transplant recipients, are receiving minimal or no immunosuppression, and have no recent graft rejection (<strong>weak, moderate</strong>).* </li>
        <li>Vaccination should <em>not</em> be withheld because of concern about transplant organ rejection (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>). </li>

        <li>Asplenic patients and those with sickle cell diseases should receive vaccines including PCV13 for children aged &amp;lt;2 years, as recommended routinely for immunocompetent persons based on the CDC annual schedule. No vaccine is contraindicated (<strong>strong, moderate</strong>) except LAIV (<strong>weak, very low</strong>). </li>
        <li>PCV13 should be administered to asplenic patients and patients with sickle cell diseases aged &amp;ge;2 years based on the CDC annual schedule for children and as in recommendations 27a&amp;ndash;c (<strong>strong, very low-moderate</strong>). </li>
        <li>PPSV23 should be administered to asplenic patients and patients with a sickle cell disease aged &amp;ge;2 years (<strong>strong, low</strong>) with an interval of &amp;ge;8 weeks after PCV13, and a second dose of PPSV23 should be administered 5 years later (<strong>strong, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>For PPSV23-naive patients aged &amp;ge;2 years for whom a splenectomy is planned, PPSV23 should be administered &amp;ge;2 weeks prior to surgery (and following indicated dose[s] of PCV13; <strong>strong, moderate</strong>) or &amp;ge;2 weeks following surgery (<strong>weak, low</strong>).* </li>
        <li>One dose of Hib vaccine should be administered to unvaccinated persons aged &amp;ge;5 years who are asplenic or have a sickle cell disease (<strong>weak, low</strong>). </li>
        <li>Meningococcal vaccine should be administered to patients aged &amp;ge;2 months who are asplenic or have a sickle cell disease (<strong>strong, low</strong>), as in recommendation 29. However, MCV4-D should<em> not</em> be administered in patients aged &amp;lt;2 years because of a reduced antibody response to some pneumococcal serotypes when both MCV4 and PCV are administered simultaneously (<strong>strong, low</strong>).

<p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee (SPGC) collaborated with partner organizations and convened a panel of 12 experts in vaccination of immunocompromised patients with a goal of devising recommendations for clinical practice. The panel represented diverse geographic areas, pediatric and adult practitioners, and a wide breadth of specialties (gastroenterology, immunology, infectious diseases, hematology and oncology, rheumatology, and stem cell and solid organ transplantation) and organizations (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]; American College of Rheumatology; North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition; American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP]; Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society; and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation).</p>
<p><strong>Process Overview and Consensus Development Based on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Panel subgroups reviewed the initial literature search, selected references, evaluated evidence, drafted recommendations, and summarized the evidence for each section. Published guidelines formed the basis for recommendations on vaccination of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with modifications based on newer references and discussion among panel members.</p>
<p>Drafts were circulated among panel members for commentary and discussed on 14 occasions by teleconference or in-person meeting.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The decision to administer or withhold a vaccine should be based on balancing the burden of the vaccine-preventable disease and risk of developing severe or life-threatening infection with the wild-type pathogen and the risks of adverse effects from vaccination. </li>
    <li>The risk of posttransplant disease from pretransplant administration of live vaccines such as varicella (VAR), measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), or zoster (ZOS) vaccines has not been completely defined. A waiting period of 4 weeks was chosen based, in part, on the outer range of risk for developing skin lesions postvaccination for most patients. </li>
    <li>MMR vaccine was safely administered to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children with &amp;ge;15% CD4 T lymphocytes in &amp;gt;1200 patients. However, some severe complications occurred in children with lower CD4 T-cell lymphocyte percentages or counts. </li>
    <li>Data are very limited on yellow fever vaccine in immunocompromised persons. Investigators recently studied the effect of yellow fever vaccine in 70 patients with rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and spondyloarthropathies who were treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Mild adverse effects (e.g., rash, myalgia, elevated hepatic transaminases) occurred in 22.5% of vaccinees, suggesting a reasonably safety profile. However, sample size was inadequate for detecting rare serious complications, and cases of yellow fever vaccine&amp;ndash;associated viscerotropic disease have been reported in this population. Yellow fever vaccine has been safely administered to a limited number of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients and to more than 200 HIV-infected adults, the majority of whom had CD4 T-cell lymphocyte counts &amp;gt;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. An increase in relapse of multiple sclerosis was noted in 7 yellow fever vaccine recipients. </li>
    <li>Administration of inactivated vaccines to HIV-infected persons appears safe as no increases in adverse effects or HIV-specific adverse effects have been recognized. However, data are not sufficient to comment on rare adverse effects. </li>
    <li>In the United States, diphtheria toxoid in combination with tetanus toxoid (DT) vaccine is not approved for persons aged &amp;gt;6 years due to adverse effects. However, experience with adult HSCT recipients indicates a lower risk for adverse effects than in previously vaccinated immunocompetent adults, suggesting that the adverse effect profile of DT vaccine may be acceptable in this population. It has not yet been determined whether the immune response to tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid vaccine (Td) is equivalent to the response to DT vaccine. </li>

    <li>Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is contraindicated for asplenic patients, immunocompromised patients, and those with sickle cell diseases. </li>
    <li>Live vaccines are generally contraindicated in immunodeficient patients because attenuation is relative. </li>
    <li>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is contraindicated for patients with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) because paralytic poliomyelitis has occurred after vaccination. </li>
    <li>Varicella vaccine (VAR) is generally considered contraindicated for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are receiving 6-mercaptopurine. </li>
    <li>Live, attenuated, cold-adapted intranasal influenza vaccine is not administered to immunocompromised patients based on insufficient clinical data to support these judgments. </li>

    <li>In general, live vaccines are contraindicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with low CD4 T-cell lymphocyte counts or percentages. </li>
    <li>Live viral vaccines are contraindicated during chemotherapy because of the risk of disseminated disease. </li>
    <li>Many molecular defects can result in defects of antiviral immunity, contraindicating the use of live viral vaccines. </li>

    <li>It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. The guidelines are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. </li>
    <li>Data on safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy/effectiveness of vaccines for immunocompromised populations are limited. Prelicensure studies often exclude immunocompromised persons, and postlicensure studies examine small numbers of immunocompromised patients. These small numbers are problematic when assessing adverse effects. Furthermore, immune defects vary among and within categories of patients with immune deficiencies (e.g., degree of immune deficiency, nutritional status, immunosuppressive regimen), which may limit the generalizability of study findings. </li>
    <li>This guideline addresses vaccines routinely recommended on the basis of patient age, social or occupational history, increased risk of infection related to underlying disease or treatment of disease, and travel. Vaccines for bioterrorism are not addressed. Immunobiological agents administered for active vaccination are addressed; immune globulin preparations and monoclonal antibodies used for passive vaccination are not. This guideline focuses on vaccines available in the United States, which are often relevant to other areas. Informed consent prior to vaccination, including provision of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine information statement, documentation of the vaccination, communication about vaccination to the patient (parent) or to clinicians involved in the patient's care, and discussion of vaccination registries, is beyond the scope of this document. </li>

<p>All panel members complied with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) policy on conflict of interest, which requires disclosure of any financial or other interest that might be construed as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict. They were provided IDSA's conflict-of-interest disclosure statement and asked to identify ties to companies that develop products that might be affected by promulgation of the guideline. Information was requested regarding employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, research funding, expert testimony, and membership on company advisory committees. The panel decided on a case-by-case basis whether conflict should limit member participation.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The following list is a reflection of what has been reported to the IDSA. In order to provide thorough transparency, the IDSA requires full disclosure of all relationships, regardless of relevancy to the guideline topic. Evaluation of such relationships as potential conflicts of interest is determined by a review process that includes assessment by the Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee (SPGC) chair, the SPGC liaison to the development panel, the Board of Directors liaison to the SPGC, and, if necessary, the Conflict of Interest Task Force of the board. This assessment of disclosed relationships for possible conflict of interest is based on the relative weight of the financial relationship (i.e., monetary amount) and the relevance of the relationship (i.e., the degree to which an association might reasonably be interpreted by an independent observer as related to the topic or recommendation of consideration). The reader of these guidelines should be mindful of this when the list of disclosures is reviewed. R. A. has served as a subinvestigator on clinical trials funded by ViroPharma, Roche, and the CDC.
