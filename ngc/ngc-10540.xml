	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

The DAR for this guidance was prepared by Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam and Maastricht University (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Systematic Review Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>Search Strategy</em></p>
<p>Search strategies were based on target condition and intervention, as recommended in the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance for undertaking reviews in health care and the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews.</p>
<p>Candidate search terms were identified from target references, browsing database thesauri (e.g., Medline MeSH and EMBASE Emtree), existing reviews identified during the rapid appraisal process and initial scoping searches. These scoping searches were used to generate test sets of target references, which informed text mining analysis of high-frequency subject indexing terms using Endnote reference management software. Strategy development involved an iterative approach testing candidate text and indexing terms across a sample of bibliographic databases and aimed to reach a satisfactory balance of sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p>The following databases were searched for relevant studies from 2000 to August 2011:</p>

<p>Searches were undertaken to identify studies of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) mutation testing in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main EMBASE strategy for each set of searches was independently peer reviewed by a second Information Specialist, using the PRESS-EBC checklist. Search strategies were developed specifically for each database and the keywords associated with NSCLC were adapted according to the configuration of each database. Searches took into account generic and other product names for the intervention. No restrictions on language or publication status were applied. Limits were applied to remove animal studies. Full search strategies are reported in Appendix 1 in the DAR.</p>
<p>Electronic searches were undertaken for the conference abstracts. Refer to the Assessment Report for web sites and dates searched.</p>
<p>Identified references were downloaded in Endnote X4 software for further assessment and handling. References in retrieved articles were checked for additional studies. The final list of included papers was also checked on PubMed for retractions, errata, and related citations.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>Separate inclusion criteria were developed for each of the three clinical effectiveness questions; these are summarised in Table 2 in the DAR.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Screening</em></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by searches and any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus. Full copies of all studies deemed potentially relevant were obtained and the same two reviewers independently assessed these for inclusion; any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Details of studies excluded at the full paper screening stage are presented in Appendix 5 in the DAR.</p>
<p>Studies provided by the manufacturers of therascreen&amp;reg;, and cobas&amp;reg; EGFR Mutation Testing Kit were first checked against the project reference database, in Endnote X4; any studies not already identified by the searches were screened for inclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Review of Economic Analyses of EGFR Mutation Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Search Strategy</em></p>
<p>Searches were undertaken to identify cost-effectiveness studies of EGFR-TK testing in NSCLC. As with the clinical effectiveness searching, the main EMBASE strategy for each set of searches was independently peer reviewed by a second Information Specialist, using the PRESS-EBC checklist. Search strategies were developed specifically for each database and searches took into account generic and other product names for the intervention. All search strategies are reported in Appendix 1 in the DAR.</p>
<p>The following databases were searched for relevant studies from 2000 to present:</p>

<p>Additional searches were undertaken to update the Resource Utilisation searches in the Manufacturer's submission for Single Technology Appraisal (STA) 192. (Refer to Section 4.1.1 in the DAR for the list of resources searched.)</p>
<p>Identified references were downloaded in Endnote X4 software for further assessment and handling. References in retrieved articles were checked for additional studies.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>Studies reporting a full economic analysis, which related explicitly to the test-treat combination of EGFR mutation testing and treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), were eligible for inclusion. Specifically, one of the comparators included EGFR mutation testing and for this comparator the treatment decision was guided by the test result; patients whose tumour was EGFR-mutation negative were also included in the treatment pathway.</p>
<p>Studies were independently assessed for inclusion by two health economists, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an Expert Assessment Group to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare a Diagnostics Assessment Report (DAR). The DAR for this guidance was prepared by Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam and Maastricht University (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Systematic Review Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>Data Extraction</em></p>
<p>Data were extracted on the following: study design/details, participant details (e.g., tumour stage, histological diagnosis, performance status, smoking status, ethnicity), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation test(s) and mutations targeted, clinical outcomes, test performance outcome measures (against treatment response as reference standard), details of specific mutations identified by outcome measure (where reported) and test failure rates. Data were extracted by one reviewer, using a piloted, standard data extraction form and checked by a second; any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Full data extraction tables are provided in Appendix 2 in the DAR.</p>
<p><em>Quality Assessment</em></p>
<p>The risk of bias in included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. Studies used to derive accuracy data, for the ability of EGFR mutation tests to predict treatment response, were assessed using QUADAS-2. Studies which provided both accuracy data and data on the effectiveness of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) following testing were assessed using both tools. Risk of bias assessments was undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.</p>
<p>The results of the risk of bias assessments were summarised and presented in tables and graphs in the results of the systematic review and are presented in full, by study, in Appendix 3 in the DAR.</p>
<p><em>Survey of Laboratories Providing EGFR Mutation Testing</em></p>
<p>The Assessment Group conducted a web-based survey to gather data on the technical performance characteristics of EGFR mutation tests. An e-mail invitation was sent to National Health Service (NHS) laboratories participating in the UK National External Quality Assurance Scheme (NEQAS) pilot scheme for EGFR mutation testing, who had responded to a request to provide information to NICE at the start of this assessment. Survey Monkey online software was used to run the survey. The survey was structured into sections on:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Laboratory details </li>
    <li>EGFR testing methods </li>
    <li>Logistics Technical Methods </li>
    <li>Costs </li>
</ul>
<p>Where possible the Assessment Group used multiple choice options with tick boxes to make the survey quick and easy to complete. A copy of the survey is provided in Appendix 4 in the DAR.</p>
<p><em>Methods of Analysis/Synthesis</em></p>
<p>The results of studies included in this review were summarised by research question (see Section 1 in the DAR), i.e., studies providing technical information on EGFR mutation testing in NHS laboratories in England and Wales, studies providing information on the accuracy of EGFR mutation tests for predicting response to TKI treatment, and studies reporting information on how clinical outcomes may vary according to which test is used to select patients for TKI treatment. The Assessment Group planned to use a bivariate/hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) random effects model to generate summary estimates and a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve for test accuracy data, and a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to generate summary estimates of treatment effects. However, because the review identified a relatively small number of studies with between study variation in participant characteristics, methods used to test for EGFR mutations and mutations targeted, the Assessment Group did not consider meta-analyses to be appropriate and has provided a structured narrative synthesis.</p>
<p>For all studies that provided data on accuracy for the prediction of response to treatment with TKIs, the absolute numbers of true positive, false negative, false positive and true negative test results, as well as sensitivity and specificity values, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented in results tables, for each reference standard response (e.g., objective response [OR], disease control [DC]) reported. Where reported, data on the numbers of failed EGFR mutation tests and reasons for failure were also included in the results tables. The results of individual studies were plotted in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plane to illustrate the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity and for ease of comparison between test methods; separate plots were provided for each reference standard response. For RCTs providing information on how clinical outcomes may vary according to which test is used to select patients for TKI treatment, hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% CIs, are provided survival outcome measures (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) and relative risk (RR), with 95% CIs, are reported for tumour response outcomes (OR and DC). The results of individual studies were illustrated in forest plots. Between-study clinical heterogeneity was assessed qualitatively. There were insufficient studies to assess heterogeneity statistically such as the chi-squared test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>The health economic analysis considers the long-term consequences of technical performance and accuracy of the different tests/test combinations followed by treatment with either standard chemotherapy or a TKI in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For this purpose a decision tree and a Markov model were developed. The decision tree was used to model the test result (positive, negative or unknown) and the treatment decision. Patients with a positive test result receive an anti-EGFR TKI. It is assumed that patients with a negative test result or unknown EGFR mutation status will receive doublet chemotherapy (Pemetrexed and Cisplatin), as the negative consequences of treatment with TKIs in false positives are greater than the negative consequences of treatment with doublet chemotherapy in false negatives. The decision tree is shown in Figure 10 in the DAR.</p>
<p>The long-term consequences in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using a Markov model with a cycle time of 21 days (resembling the duration of one cycle of chemotherapy), and a time horizon of six years. Health states in the Markov model are: progression free (subdivided into 'response' and 'stable disease'), disease progression and death. In the progression-free state, patients are on treatment (either TKI or doublet chemotherapy). In each cycle these patients are subdivided over the 'stable disease' and 'response' states, based on the objective response rate, in order to account for a difference in quality of life between those states. In addition, disutilities and costs associated with treatment related characteristics (intra-venous or oral therapy) are modelled. For adverse events of treatment, disutilities and costs were applied for a single cycle in the model. The Markov model structure is shown in Figure 11 in the DAR. The model is described in more detail in <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta192&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>NICE Technology Appraisal 192</a>.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Developing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>After reviewing the evidence the Diagnostic Advisory Committee (DAC) agrees draft recommendations on the use of the technology in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. When formulating these recommendations, the Committee has discretion to consider those factors it believes are most appropriate to the evaluation. In doing so, the Committee has regard to any relevant provisions of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Directions, set out by the Secretary of State for Health, and legislation on human rights, discrimination and equality. In undertaking evaluations of healthcare technologies, NICE takes into account the broad balance of clinical benefits and costs, the degree of clinical need of patients under consideration, any guidance issued to the NHS by the Secretary of State that is specifically drawn to the attention of NICE by the Secretary of State, and any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, and the potential for long-term benefits to the NHS of innovation.</p>
<p>The Committee takes into account advice from NICE on the approach it should take to making scientific and social value judgements. Advice on social value judgements is informed in part by the work of NICE's Citizens Council.</p>
<p>The Committee takes into account how its judgements have a bearing on distributive justice or legal requirements in relation to human rights, discrimination and equality. Such characteristics include, but are not confined to: race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender reassignment and pregnancy or maternity.</p>
<p>The Committee considers the application of other Board-approved NICE methods policies, such as the supplementary guidance on discounting and the end-of-life criteria, if they are relevant to the evaluation.</p>
<p>Because the Programme often evaluates new technologies that have a thin evidence base, in formulating its recommendations the Committee balances the quality and quantity of evidence with the expected value of the technology to the NHS and the public.</p>
<p>The credibility of the guidance produced by NICE depends on the transparency of the DAC's decision-making process. It is crucial that the DAC's decisions are explained clearly, and that the contributions of registered stakeholders and the views of members of the public are considered. The reasoning behind the Committee's recommendations is explained, with reference to the factors that have been taken into account.</p>
<p>The language and style used in the documents produced by the Committee are governed by the following principles:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clarity is essential in explaining how the DAC has come to its conclusions. </li>
    <li>The text of the documents does not need to reiterate all the factual information that can be found in the information published alongside the guidance. This needs careful judgement so that enough information and justification is given in the recommendations to enable the reader to understand what evidence the DAC considered and, if appropriate, who provided that evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Committee may take into account factors that may provide benefits to the NHS or the population, such as patient convenience. It may also consider costs and other positive or negative impacts on the NHS that may not be captured in the reference-case cost analysis, such as improved processes.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Results from the 'comparative effectiveness' analysis showed the therascreen epidermal growth factor receptor polymerase chain reaction (EGFR PCR) Kit to be both less effective and less costly compared with Sanger sequencing of exons 19 to 21, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &amp;pound;32,167 saved per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) lost. Adjustments to costs and the proportions of patients with unknown mutation status in sensitivity analyses had little effect on the results. When treatment costs and adverse event costs were updated to 2012 costs, the ICER was &amp;pound;32,196 saved per QALY lost for the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit compared with Sanger sequencing. When the proportions of patients with unknown mutation status were based on the results from the web-based survey rather than information from published trials, the ICER was &amp;pound;34,555 saved per QALY lost for the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit compared with Sanger sequencing.</p>
<p>Results from the 'linked evidence' analysis also showed the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit to be both less effective and less costly than Sanger sequencing of exons 18 to 21 at an ICER of &amp;pound;31,849 saved per QALY lost. Sensitivity analyses had little effect on the results. When the treatment costs and adverse event costs were updated to 2012 costs, the ICER was &amp;pound;34,169 saved per QALY lost for the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit compared with Sanger sequencing of exons 18 to 21. When the proportions of patients with unknown mutation status were based on the results from the web-based survey rather than information from published trials, the ICER was &amp;pound;31,880 saved per QALY lost for the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit compared with Sanger sequencing of exons 18 to 21.</p>
<p>In the 'assumption of equal prognostic value' analysis, the comparative effectiveness, test accuracy and proportion of patients with unknown mutation status for each test strategy were assumed equal to those of the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit. Therefore, the test strategies only differed with respect to costs. Results showed that the test strategy of Sanger sequencing or the cobas EGFR Mutation Test for samples with insufficient tumour cells was the least expensive (&amp;pound;15 [0.06%] cheaper than Sanger sequencing of exons 18 to 21 alone), and fragment length analysis combined with pyrosequencing was the most expensive strategy (&amp;pound;33 [0.13%] more expensive than Sanger sequencing of exons 18 to 21 alone).</p>
<p>The External Assessment Group did not include next-generation sequencing and the therascreen EGFR Pyro Kit in any of the cost-effectiveness analyses because of a lack of data.</p>
<p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The Diagnostics Advisory Committee noted that the analysis in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance 192 (Gefitinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer) was primarily based on data from the IPASS trial, which used the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit to classify tumours of patients as EGFR-tyrosine kinase (TK) mutation positive or negative. The Committee acknowledged that the recommendation of gefitinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose tumours test positive for the EGFR-TK mutation (NICE technology appraisal guidance 192) implies that the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit is recommended and cost-effective as part of the test-treat strategy. The Committee concluded that, for the cobas EGFR Mutation Test and for Sanger sequencing-based methods, an equivalent evidence base exists, and therefore these tests and the therascreen EGFR PCR Kit can be considered clinically effective and cost-effective for informing first-line treatment decisions in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in the NHS. The Committee further concluded that, for the non-Sanger sequencing-based tests (high-resolution melt analysis, pyrosequencing combined with fragment length analysis and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis) and for tests not included in the External Assessment Group's assessment (the therascreen EGFR Pyro Kit and next-generation sequencing), the evidence was insufficient to allow any recommendations to be made on their use.</p>
