	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence-Based, Formal Consensus, Informal Consensus, No Recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Endocrine therapy, rather than chemotherapy, should be offered as the standard first-line treatment for patients with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive advanced/metastatic breast cancer, except for immediately life threatening disease or if there is concern regarding endocrine resistance.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The main benefit is less toxicity and better quality of life for the patient associated with endocrine therapy compared with chemotherapy (potential benefit: high). The harm is that metastatic disease could progress rapidly and prove fatal if there is no response, but the risk of this is low (potential harm: low). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence is intermediate, and is based on the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer (NCCC) systematic review. </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is strong and is supported by the evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: It should be noted that the basis for this recommendation is the relative likelihood of response to chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy and not the rapidity of response, for which there are no good data.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Sequential single-agent chemotherapy rather than combination therapy should be offered, although combination regimens may be considered for immediately life-threatening disease for which time may allow only one potential chance for therapy.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefit is less toxicity and better quality of life (potential benefit: high). The potential harm is for rapidly progressing, life-threatening disease to escape control if response to a single agent isn't achieved (potential harm: high). The main benefit is there is less toxicity and better quality of life for the patient associated with sequential single agent chemotherapy compared with combination chemotherapy (potential benefit: high). The harm is that metastatic disease could progress rapidly if there is no response, but the risk of this is low (potential harm: low). </li>
        <li>The evidence quality is high, and includes a large randomized controlled trial (RCT). </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is strong. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>With regard to targeted agents, the role of bevacizumab is controversial, and this therapy should be considered (where available) with single-agent chemotherapy only when there is immediately life-threatening disease or severe symptoms, in view of improved response rates (similar to Recommendation 2 regarding the use of combination chemotherapy). It is recognized that there is not currently an approved indication for bevacizumab in the United States because the weight of evidence shows no significant survival benefit. Other targeted agents should not be used either in addition to, or as a replacement for, chemotherapy in this setting outside of a trial.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefit is improved disease control (potential benefit: moderate). The potential harms are unique toxicity, increased costs, and barriers to access (potential harm: high). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence is high and is supported by multiple trials. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is moderate and is based on both evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: Bevacizumab added to single-agent chemotherapy improves response and progression-free survival but not overall survival.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>No single agent has demonstrated superiority in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer, and there are several active agents appropriate for first-line chemotherapy. The evidence for efficacy is strongest for taxanes and anthracyclines. Other options include capecitabine, gemcitabine, platinum-based compounds, vinorelbine, and ixabepilone. Treatment selection should be based on previous therapy, differential toxicity, comorbid conditions, and patient preferences. Specifically, drugs for which clinical resistance has already been shown should not be reused.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefit is a patient-tailored approach with potential improvements in disease control and quality of life (potential benefit: high). The harm is the potential use of a less active agent (potential harm: low). </li>
        <li>The evidence quality supporting the activity of a number of single agents is high, but there is insufficient evidence to support superiority of any single agent. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong and is based on the available evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy should be continued until progression of disease as tolerated because it modestly improves overall survival and substantially improves progression-free survival, but this has to be balanced against toxicity and quality of life. Short breaks, flexibility in scheduling, or a switch to endocrine therapy (in patients with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive disease) may be offered to selected patients.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefits are more time before disease-progression and modestly improved survival (potential benefit: high). The harm is more prolonged toxicity (potential harm: moderate). </li>
        <li>The evidence quality is high, and is based on a systematic review with meta-analysis. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong, and is supported by evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: It is recognized that the balance between continuing treatment to maintain disease control and coping with progressive adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity is a difficult one. It will be influenced by many factors, including drug used (e.g., long-term use of capecitabine is relatively easy, whereas docetaxel is severely limited by cumulative toxicity) and requires a continuing dialogue between doctor and patient.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy regimens should not be specifically tailored to different breast cancer subtypes (e.g., triple negative, lobular) at the present time due to the absence of evidence proving differential efficacies. In addition, in vitro chemoresistance assays should not be used to select treatment.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefits are not omitting potentially efficacious treatment and cost-saving on in vitro assays (potential benefit: high). </li>
        <li>Current evidence shows no convincing basis for either of these approaches. </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is moderate, and is supported by expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: This recommendation will need to be modified if ongoing or future research addressing this important issue suggests benefits of tailoring.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Second- and later-line therapy may be of clinical benefit and should be offered as determined by previous treatments, toxicity, coexisting medical conditions, and patient choice. As with first-line treatment, no clear evidence exists for the superiority of one specific drug or regimen. Active agents include those active in first-line treatment.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefit is further chance of disease control and symptomatic improvement (potential benefit: high). The harm is toxicity (potential harm: high). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence ranges from high to low as reported in multiple randomized trials. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong and is based on expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: The most convincing data are for eribulin based on survival superiority against best standard treatment in a recent large RCT, but there is a lack of good comparative data between these various agents.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Palliative care should be offered throughout the continuum of care. As there are diminishing returns with later lines of chemotherapy, clinicians should also offer best supportive care without further chemotherapy as an option.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The benefits include a patient-centered approach emphasizing quality of life (potential benefit: high). The main harm is fear of abandonment and giving up hope, which can be addressed by effective communication and appropriate end-of-life planning (potential harm: moderate). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence is intermediate and is supported by several RCTs in patients with advanced cancer. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong and is supported by evidence, expert consensus, and another independent expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: Evidence suggests that response to second and subsequent lines of chemotherapy is strongly influenced by response to earlier treatment; patients whose disease has failed to respond to up to two initial lines of treatment are less likely to respond to a third or subsequent line.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>As there is no cure yet for patients with advanced breast cancer, clinicians should encourage all eligible patients to enroll onto clinical trials.

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this guideline was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>For this clinical practice guideline (CPG), the recommendations were developed by an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation using a systematic review (January 2009 through to May 2013 for first-line trials; January 1993 through to May 2013 for second-line trials) of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and clinical experience.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Included women 18 years of age and older with&amp;nbsp;human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (or unknown) advanced breast cancer </li>
    <li>Were fully published reports identified using the MEDLINE (OVID) database or abstracts from specific conference proceedings (San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; 2011, 2012) and ASCO abstracts (2012, 2013) </li>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, community oncology, patient representation, and guideline methodology. The Expert Panel members are listed in the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel, who met via teleconference and corresponded through email, were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations in consideration of the evidence. Members of the Expert Panel are responsible for drafting the penultimate version of guideline, which was then circulated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> for editorial review and publication.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations were developed on the basis of systematic reviews of the scientific literature and expert panel consensus, using the best available evidence and clinical experience as guides. The recommendations are evidence based and informed by randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. Summary descriptions of results are provided in the literature review and analysis section of the original guideline document. Ratings for the type of recommendation and strength of the evidence are offered (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; fields).</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using the Guidelines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software (see the Methodology Supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). A guideline implementability review was conducted to improve clarity around recommended actions for clinical practice.</p></div>"/>

    <li>There are many agents available for the systemic treatment of breast cancer that may result in tumor response or stability; however, most antineoplastic agents are also associated with adverse events (AEs) that may impair quality of life (QoL) and even cause life-threatening toxicity. </li>
    <li>In one study there were no significant differences between the duration of overall survival (OS) between single-agent and combination arms, and the combination arm was associated with more severe adverse effects. Another pivotal trial reported as well, along with two follow-up articles, that single-agent sequential therapy is likely no different from combination regimens, although combination regimens are associated with greater, and more severe, AEs. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Guideline Implementation</strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors, and to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href=&quot;http://www.asco.org/&quot; title=&quot;ASCO Web site&quot;>ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
