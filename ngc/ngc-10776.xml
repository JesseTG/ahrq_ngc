	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The recommendations below encompass 4 major areas: diagnosis, predictors of severity, surveillance for complications, and treatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>When clinical presentation of FSHD is typical and the inheritance pattern is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, clinical diagnosis is usually straightforward. If, in such circumstances, the diagnosis is genetically confirmed in a first-degree relative, genetic testing is not necessary for each affected individual. However, atypical presentations are not uncommon. In the setting of atypical or sporadic cases, genetic confirmation is important for genetic counseling, especially with the recent discovery of 2 genetically distinct forms of FSHD.</p>
<p>In the most common FSHD type, FSHD1, disease results from contraction of a DNA repeat sequence, termed <em>D4Z4 repeat</em>, on 1 copy of 4q35 from &amp;gt;10 repeats to 1&amp;ndash;10 repeats. In addition, the contraction must occur in the presence of 1 particular (A variant) of 2 (A/B) sequence variants distal to the repeats. Available molecular testing for FSHD1, which measures only the presence of a repeat contraction on initial testing, is highly sensitive and specific. In studies that utilized strict diagnostic criteria for FSHD, determining whether a contraction occurs on an A variant genetic background does not appear to improve diagnostic specificity. However, in clinical practice, strict clinical diagnostic criteria might not be adhered to, increasing the chances of a false-positive result. In consequence, determining that a D4Z4 contraction is occurring on an A variant is warranted when the clinical presentation is atypical for FSHD. At present, commercial genetic testing in FSHD is limited to FSHD1 testing.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain genetic confirmation of FSHD1 in patients with atypical presentations and no first-degree relatives with genetic confirmation of the disease (<strong>Level B</strong>). The figure in the original guideline document shows the recommended FSHD molecular diagnosis decision tree.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Predictors of Severity in FSHD</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Factors that predict disease severity in FSHD are important for counseling patients and for screening for and managing potential complications. The D4Z4 deletion size appears to be somewhat predictive of the overall rate of disease progression. D4Z4 deletion size should be used cautiously for predicting disease progression rate in any particular individual due to other sources of variation affecting disease severity, including intrafamilial factors. Clinical experience suggests that patients with severe childhood-onset disease almost invariably have very large deletions (i.e., contracted D4Z4 allele of 10&amp;ndash;20 kb or 1&amp;ndash;4 repeats), suggesting a much more robust correlation between disease severity and large deletions.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Large D4Z4 deletion sizes (contracted D4Z4 allele of 10&amp;ndash;20 kb) should alert the clinician that the patient is more likely to develop more significant disability and at an earlier age. Patients with large deletions are also more likely to develop symptomatic extra muscular manifestations (<strong>Level B</strong>) (see the next section, &quot;Monitoring for Complications of FSHD&quot;).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Monitoring for Complications of FSHD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulmonary Complications</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The guideline panel's systematic review revealed that some patients with FSHD develop respiratory muscle weakness that can result in respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilator assistance (e.g., nocturnal bilevel positive airway pressure), although this complication is uncommon. Patients with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular-related weakness often do not have classic symptoms of ventilatory failure (i.e., overt dyspnea). Impending respiratory failure, therefore, may begin with respiratory insufficiency mainly during sleep, resulting in excessive daytime somnolence or nonrestorative sleep. Respiratory insufficiency in patients with FSHD, therefore, may be evident only through pulmonary function testing. Respiratory failure constitutes a major source of morbidity in patients with most MD types and can severely disrupt sleeping, daily activities, and quality of life (QOL). Early intervention with noninvasive mechanical ventilation leads to improved survival and QOL.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain baseline pulmonary function tests on all patients with FSHD. Patients should be monitored regularly if they have abnormal baseline pulmonary function test results or any combination of severe proximal weakness, kyphoscoliosis, wheelchair dependence, or comorbid conditions that may affect ventilation (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac disease) (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients who have FSHD and either (1) compromised pulmonary function studies (e.g., forced vital capacity &amp;lt;60%) or (2) symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence or nonrestorative sleep (e.g., frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches), clinicians should refer patients for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for consideration of nocturnal sleep monitoring or nocturnal noninvasive ventilation in order to improve QOL (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Patients with FSHD who do not get regular pulmonary function testing should be tested prior to surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia, as such testing may uncover asymptomatic respiratory compromise (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Cardiac Abnormalities</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The guideline panel's systematic review revealed very little evidence for structural cardiac abnormalities in FSHD. Also, data are insufficient to suggest that patients with FSHD are susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias. Routine electrocardiographic/echocardiographic testing is therefore unnecessary in patients with FSHD who are asymptomatic.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Patients with FSHD should be referred for cardiac evaluation if they develop overt signs or symptoms of cardiac disease (e.g., shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations). However, routine cardiac screening is not essential in the absence of cardiac signs or symptoms (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Retinal Vascular Disease</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The guideline panel's systematic review suggests that symptomatic retinal vascular disease in the form of an exudative retinopathy (Coats disease) is very rare in FSHD but tends to affect patients with large deletions almost exclusively. Untreated exudative retinopathy can lead to significant visual loss, which may be prevented by early intervention.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should refer patients with FSHD and large deletions (contracted D4Z4 allele of 10&amp;ndash;20 kb) to an experienced ophthalmologist (e.g., retina specialist) for dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (<strong>Level B</strong>). The presence and severity of retinal vascular disease at initial screening should be used to determine the frequency of subsequent monitoring (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The guideline panel's systematic review shows that the available studies fail to capture the prevalence and clinical relevance of hearing loss in FSHD. In clinical practice, most patients with FSHD and hearing loss requiring the use of a hearing aid have childhood-onset FSHD with large D4Z4 deletions. Two recent studies support this clinical impression. Moreover, one of the studies suggests that hearing loss is progressive in some patients. Adults and older children are cognizant of the hearing loss onset, and therefore intervention can occur early when required. However, failure to detect hearing loss in infants and younger children may significantly delay or impair language development.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should screen all young children with FSHD at diagnosis and yearly thereafter until these children start school, as hearing loss may not be present at diagnosis and can be progressive (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Pain</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Pain is a common complaint in FSHD and appears to be mostly musculoskeletal in origin. Pain compounding muscle weakness can have a significant impact on QOL. Physical therapists often can provide insight into the mechanism of pain in patients with weakness. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are useful for acute pain, and antidepressants or antiepileptics for chronic musculoskeletal pain.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Treating physicians should routinely inquire about pain in patients with FSHD. Referral for a physical therapy evaluation may prove helpful as an initial nonpharmacologic intervention. In patients with persistent pain and no contraindications, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is appropriate for acute pain and antidepressants or antiepileptics for chronic pain (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment of FSHD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pharmacologic Interventions</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>As of this writing, no evidence exists for any effective pharmacologic interventions that improve strength or slow disease progression in FSHD. Randomized, controlled trials of albuterol were negative. Uncontrolled, open-label trials of corticosteroid and diltiazem showed no benefit. A controlled early phase II study of MYO-029, a myostatin inhibitor, also failed to show benefit.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>In patients with FSHD, clinicians should not prescribe albuterol, corticosteroid, or diltiazem for improving strength (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Scapular Fixation</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>In patients with FSHD, limited shoulder range of motion due to periscapular muscle weakness is a major source of functional limitation. Moreover, in many patients, bedside manual scapular fixation can result in significant improvement in shoulder range of motion. Postoperative complications are infrequent but include hemothorax or pneumothorax, pain, infection, nonunion, and reduced lung capacity. Scapular fixation appears to be generally safe and may be effective for improving shoulder range of motion.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Surgical scapular fixation might be offered cautiously to selected patients after careful consideration of the overall muscle impairment in the involved arm, assessment of potential gain in range of motion by manual fixation of the scapula, the patient's rate of disease progression, and the potential adverse consequences of surgery and prolonged postsurgical bracing (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Aerobic Exercise</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Aerobic exercise in FSHD appears to be safe and potentially beneficial, as has been shown in many other muscle diseases. Aerobic fitness is important for overall health. To minimize injury from falls or overuse, the type of aerobic exercise should be tailored to the patient's particular distribution of weakness. For example, a stationary bicycle rather than a treadmill should be recommended for patients with leg weakness. Although no data exist to suggest that strength training is detrimental in FSHD, further research is needed to determine whether such strength training will result in clinically meaningful long-term functional improvement.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Clinicians might encourage patients with FSHD to engage in low-intensity aerobic exercise. An experienced physical therapist can help guide development of individualized exercise programs. Clinicians might also use the practical physical activities guidelines for individuals with disabilities, provided by the US Department of Health and Human Services, when counseling patients about aerobic exercise (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients interested in strength training, clinicians may refer patients to physical therapists to establish a safe exercise program using appropriate low/ medium weights/resistance that takes into consideration the patients' physical limitations (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb should. Should recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb may or might. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In July 2010, the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee (GDDI) of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Practice Issues Review Panel (PIRP) of the American Association of the Neuromuscular &amp;amp; Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) convened a panel of clinicians with expertise in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (see Appendices e-1 and e-2 in the FSHD Guideline [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field] for a listing of the members of the AAN GDDI and AANEM PIRP). In accordance with the processes outlined in the 2004 and 2011 AAN guideline development manuals, the panel searched the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Scopus databases from 1948 to October 2012 for relevant peer-reviewed articles in humans and in all languages (see Appendix e-3 in the FSHD Guideline for search strategies).</p>
<p>The guideline addresses the following practical issues related to FSHD (reflective only of evidence relevant to FSHD1; no large FSHD2 clinical studies exist):</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>For patients with clinically defined FSHD (as determined by explicitly stated clinical criteria substantially similar to the consortium criteria), how often does D4Z4 contraction on 4q35 confirm the diagnosis of FSHD (irrespective of its occurrence on an allele A)? For individuals who do not have FSHD, how often is a D4Z4 contraction on 4q35 found? For individuals who do not have FSHD, how often is a D4Z4 contraction on 4q35 on allele A found? </li>
    <li>Which factors are associated with or predict loss of clinically meaningful milestones (e.g., loss of independent ambulation)? </li>
    <li>How frequent are respiratory abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, retinal disease, hearing loss, and pain? </li>
    <li>Do interventions (as compared with no intervention) improve patient relevant outcomes? Are there features that identify patients who are more or less likely to improve with a specific intervention? </li>
</ol>
<p>Selected articles contained information relevant to the 4 questions posed above and had acceptable study designs, including randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; case-control studies; and case series. Reviews and meta-analyses were excluded, as were studies with 6 or fewer participants for studies of FSHD complications and prognosis, fewer than 9 participants for genetic screening, and fewer than 5 participants for treatment. Also excluded were studies not relevant to the clinical questions, studies including participants who had unrelated diseases or were outside of the study population, and articles that were not peer reviewed.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The methods used to develop this guideline are detailed in the FSHD Guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). In brief, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) convened an author panel of clinicians with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) expertise. The panel systematically reviewed the evidence relevant to the posed questions according to the processes described in the 2004 and 2011 AAN process manuals. The panel formulated practice recommendations based on the evidence systematically reviewed, stipulated axiomatic principles of care, strong evidence from closely related conditions, and judgments regarding risk benefit and patient preferences.</p>
<p>The panel formulated a rationale for recommendations based on the evidence systematically reviewed and stipulated axiomatic principles of care. This rationale is explained in a section that precedes each set of recommendations. From this rationale, corresponding actionable recommendations were inferred. The level of obligation of the recommendations was assigned using a modified Delphi process that considered the following prespecified domains: the confidence in the evidence systematically reviewed, the acceptability of axiomatic principles of care, the strength of indirect evidence, and the relative magnitude of benefit to harm. Additional factors explicitly considered by the panel that could modify the level of obligation include judgments regarding the importance of outcomes, cost of compliance with the recommendation relative to benefit, the availability of the intervention, and anticipated variations in patients' preferences. The prespecified rules for determining the final level of obligation from these domains are indicated in Appendix e-5 in the FSHD Guideline. The level of obligation was indicated using standard modal operators. <em>Must</em> corresponds to <em>Level A</em>, very strong recommendations; <em>should</em> to <em>Level B</em>, strong recommendations; and <em>might</em> to <em>Level C</em>, weak recommendations. The panel members' judgments supporting the levels of obligation are indicated in Appendix e-6 of the FSHD Guideline.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. Level A is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. Level B corresponds to the helping verb should. Should recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, Level C corresponds to the helping verb may or might. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A <strong>Level R</strong> designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular &amp;amp; Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) are committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN and AANEM keep separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN and AANEM limit the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN and AANEM forbid commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, at least 1 AANEM committee, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em>&amp;reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
