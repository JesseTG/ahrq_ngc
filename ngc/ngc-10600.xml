	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic literature search of the databases MEDLINE&amp;reg;, CINAHL&amp;reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and nonrandomized trials and studies, case reports, letters, reviews, and guidelines. Search terms included <em>surgical skin preparation, skin preparation, skin prep, skin antisepsis, skin antiseptic, sterile preparation, disinfectants, local anti-infective agents, antiseptic solution, preoperative care, perioperative nursing, preoperative, surgical procedures, surgical wound infection, skin, skin care, paint, scrub, antiseptic shower, antiseptic cloth, chlorhexidine wipe, preoperative shower, preoperative wash, preoperative bathing, bathing and baths, hair removal, shaving, depilation, depilatory, nonshaved, razor, clipping, clipper, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, iodine, iodophors, iodine compounds, 2-propanol, alcohols, baby shampoo, isopropyl alcohol, alcohol-based, parachoroxylenol, chloroxylenol, PCMX, DuraPrep, pHisoHex, Prevantics, Hibiclens, Techni-Care, Chlora-Prep, Betadine, Betasept, PVP-I Prep, ExCel AP, Castile, iodophor, cyanoacrylates, tissue adhesives, chemical burns, skin diseases, dermatitis, skin sensitivity, surgical fires, fires, flammability, flammable, penis, vagina, mucous membrane, stoma, fingernails, nail polish, artificial nails, jewelry, body piercing, body jewelry,</em> and <em>subdermal implant</em>.</p>
<p>The initial search, conducted on December 5, 2013, was limited to literature published in English between January 2006 and December 2013; however, the time restriction was not considered in subsequent searches. At the time of the search, the librarian also established weekly alerts on the topics included in the search and until February 2014, presented relevant alert results to the lead author.</p>
<p>Before the systematic search, the medical librarian had provided the lead author with a list of the citations from the 2008 revision of the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Recommended Practices for Preoperative Patient Skin Antisepsis for consideration for the 2014 revision. During the development of the guideline, the lead author requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. Finally, the lead author and medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer&amp;ndash;reviewed publications, studies that evaluated skin antisepsis as part of a bundle to prevent surgical site infection (SSI), and low-quality evidence when higher-quality evidence was available.</p>

    <li>The harms of preoperative patient bathing with an antiseptic may include skin irritation, allergic reaction, or unnecessary treatment with antiseptics. </li>
    <li>The benefits of a 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) shampoo may not outweigh the potential harms of CHG causing injury by contact with the eyes, ears, or mouth. </li>
    <li>Neonates, especially extremely premature neonates, are at an increased risk for skin irritation and chemical burns of the skin from both CHG and alcohol-based skin antiseptics. </li>
    <li>The harms of leaving the hair in place at the surgical site may include risk of fire. The risk of fire may be minimized by confining the hair with a water-soluble gel and non-metallic ties or with braids for longer hair. </li>
    <li>Some patients are susceptible to iodism from preoperative skin antisepsis with iodine and iodophor-based antiseptics.&amp;nbsp;A literature review recommended minimizing neonatal iodine exposure because of the risk of significant iodine overload and severe transient hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates with increased skin permeability and immature thyroid glands. </li>
    <li>Fragile skin or tissue, burns, and open wounds are at a high risk for skin injury during preoperative patient skin antisepsis. Vigorous skin antisepsis in areas of malignancy may potentially spread cancer cells. </li>
    <li>Flammable skin antiseptics are a fuel source and pose a fire hazard. The prevention of pooling of flammable skin antiseptics and allowing for the complete drying of the antiseptic to minimize the fire hazard is supported by published guidance. Disposal of unused flammable skin antiseptics must be handled in a manner to decrease the risk of fire and in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. </li>
    <li>Refer to the original guideline document for additional discussion of potential harms of specific interventions. Also refer to Table 2 in the original guideline document for considerations and cautions for use of specific skin antiseptics. </li>

    <li>The presence of hair may contraindicate the use of flammable antiseptics according to manufacturers' instructions for use. A flammable antiseptic for preoperative skin antisepsis is contraindicated when the procedure involves an ignition source (e.g., electrosurgical unit [ESU], laser) and the solution is unable to dry completely in hair. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), alcohol-based skin antiseptics that wick into the patient's hair result in prolonged drying times. No evidence was found that describes the length or amount of hair that constitutes a fire risk during use of alcohol-based skin antiseptics. </li>
