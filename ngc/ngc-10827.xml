	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li>In patients without a personal history of colorectal or another cancer but with a family history suggestive of Lynch syndrome, the AGA suggests that risk prediction models be offered rather than proceeding directly with germline genetic testing. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA recommends testing the tumors of all patients with colorectal cancer with either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or for micro satellite instability (MSI) to identify potential cases of Lynch syndrome versus doing no testing for Lynch syndrome. (<strong>Strong recommendation, Moderate quality of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that in patients with colorectal cancer with IHC absent for <em>MLH1</em>, second-stage tumor testing for a <em>BRAF</em> mutation or for hypermethylation of the <em>MLH1</em> promoter should be performed rather than proceeding directly to germline genetic testing. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA recommends surveillance colonoscopy (versus doing nothing) in persons with Lynch syndrome. (<strong>Strong recommendation, Moderate quality of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that surveillance colonoscopy should be performed every 1 to 2 years versus less frequent intervals. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Low quality of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that aspirin be offered for cancer prevention in patients with Lynch syndrome. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Low quality of evidence</strong>) </li>

<p>An experienced librarian conducted 3 distinct computerized medical literature searches (according to grouping of population, intervention, comparator, and outcome [PICO] questions using a similar search strategy) using the following databases from inception to November 18, 2013: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Health Technology Assessment.</p>
<p>All searches included a highly sensitive search strategy to identify reports of randomized trials, cohort studies, or case-control studies using a combination of controlled vocabulary and text words. The first search related to PICO questions 1, 2, 4, and 5 included the following terms: (1) hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Lynch and (2) colonoscopy or immunohistochemistry or genetic testing or microsatellite instability or acetylsalicylic acid (complete search strings are shown in Appendix 2 of the technical review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The search related to PICO question 3 addressed the following: (1) colorectal neoplasms and (2) <em>BRAF</em> mutation or <em>MLH1</em> DNA methylation (see Appendix 3 in the technical review). In addition, recursive searches and cross-referencing was performed; hand searches of articles identified after the initial search were also completed. The PICO questions can be found in Appendix Table 1 of the technical review.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Trial Selection and Patient Population</span></strong></p>

<p>Study eligibility was assessed independently by 3 investigators, with discrepancies resolved after discussion and reaching a consensus. Data extraction was thoroughly performed by content experts. Risk of bias for individual studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for observational diagnostic studies, a modified Jadad score (one point added if allocation was concealed) for randomized trials, and the Newcastle&amp;ndash;Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The quality of the evidence for each statement was rated as very low, low, moderate, and high based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (see Appendix 5 in the technical review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]); disagreements were resolved by discussion. See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field for the quality of evidence definitions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statistical Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Study data were carefully extracted in 2x2 tables for intervention-related outcomes and comparators. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and reported as proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled estimates determined with meta-analysis using a bivariate linear mixed model were calculated by including all studies that provided data allowing computation of both sensitivity and specificity. Heterogeneity is to be expected in the results; therefore, the investigators used random effects models. To give an indication of the between-study heterogeneity, summary receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, including sensitivity and specificity confidence regions for the summary points as well as the prediction region. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.2 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2008).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline was developed by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Guidelines Committee and approved by the AGA Governing Board.</p>
<p>The guideline was developed using the AGA Process for Developing Guidelines (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Briefly, the AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and best practices as outlined by the Institute of Medicine. GRADE methodology was used to prepare the accompanying technical review on focused questions and their related specific population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO). Optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review. The quality of available evidence on each question was first judged by the technical review panel of content and methodological experts according to the published GRADE process (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Reasons justifying grading are detailed in the guideline text when appropriate. The guideline authors met with the technical review panel and a patient representative to discuss the evidence. The guideline authors subsequently met privately and drafted recommendations, taking into account the quality of evidence, as well as the balance between benefits and harms, patient preferences, and resource utilization. Such pertinent considerations are also detailed in the guideline text when relevant. The strengths of the recommendations were categorized as (1) strong, (2) weak/conditional, or (3) no recommendation according to GRADE terminology (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Formulation of Clinical Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>The participants were selected by the AGA Clinical Guidelines Committee based on clinical content and guidelines methodological expertise. Focused questions were generated, and a statement was framed for each question in terms of PICO. In accordance with a modified Delphi method, the questions and PICO statements were developed by multiple structured iterations until a consensus among experts was reached. The final proposed clinically pertinent, focused questions and PICO statements related to 3 different populations: adults without a personal history of colorectal cancer or another cancer but with a family history of cancer that could be suggestive of Lynch syndrome, adults with colorectal cancer, and adults with Lynch syndrome. The final set of questions and statements was approved by the AGA Governing Board. The final PICO questions are shown in Appendix Table 1 of the technical review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

Moreover, the dose tested in this trial was high and uncertainties about risks versus benefits remain, so an individualized approach is best, considering the patient's personal risk of adverse events with aspirin therapy. </li>
    <li>Because immunohistochemistry (IHC) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing have comparable sensitivities and specificities, their implementation has varied depending on the level of expertise and availability within a given institution. Although many sites can technically perform IHC, the results must be interpreted with caution; appropriate training and experience of pathologists is required to ensure that they are adept at interpreting the data. Furthermore, a system for systematic follow-up of all positive results must be in place. </li>
    <li>The meta-analysis in the technical review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) found that <em>BRAF</em> mutations and hypermethylation of the <em>MLH1</em> promoter are also found in some patients with Lynch syndrome.
