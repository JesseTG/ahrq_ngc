	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) Definition</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use the term BRUE to describe an event occurring in an infant &amp;lt;1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of &amp;ge;1 of the following: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cyanosis or pallor </li>
    <li>Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing </li>
    <li>Marked change in tone (hyper or hypotonia) </li>
    <li>Altered level of responsiveness </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, clinicians should diagnose a BRUE only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination (see Tables 2 and 3 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Key Action Statements for Lower-Risk BRUE</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Cardiopulmonary</strong></p>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade B</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, radiation exposure, and caregiver/infant anxiety; avoid consequences of false-positive results </li>
    <li>Risks, harm, cost: May rarely miss diagnostic opportunity for early lower respiratory tract or cardiac disease </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: The benefits of reducing unnecessary testing, radiation exposure, and false-positive results, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety, outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for lower respiratory tract or cardiac disease </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Caregiver may express concern regarding a longstanding breathing pattern in his/her infant or a recent change in breathing that might influence the decision to obtain chest radiography </li>

</ul>
<p>1D. Clinicians should not obtain measurement of venous or arterial blood gases in infants presenting with a lower-risk BRUE (<strong>Grade B, Moderate Recommendation</strong>) </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade B</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, pain, risk of thrombosis, and caregiver/infant anxiety; avoid consequences of false-positive results </li>
    <li>Risks, harm, cost: May miss rare instances of hypercapnia and acid-base imbalances </li>

    <li>Benefits: Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, and caregiver/infant anxiety; avoid consequences of false-positive results </li>
    <li>Risks, harm, cost: May miss rare instances of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and/or bradycardia that would be detected by polysomnography </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: The benefits of reducing unnecessary testing and false-positive results, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety, outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and/or bradycardia </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Caregivers may report concern regarding some aspects of their infant's sleep pattern that may influence the decision to perform polysomnography </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Strength:<strong> Moderate recommendation</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>1F. Clinicians may obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram for infants presenting with lower-risk BRUE (<strong>Grade C, Weak Recommendation</strong>) </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade C</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: May identify BRUE patients with channelopathies (long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome), ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), cardiomyopathy, or other heart disease </li>
    <li>Risks, harm, cost: False-positive results may lead to further workup, expert consultation, anxiety, and cost; false reassurance from negative results; cost and availability of electrocardiography testing and interpretation </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: The benefit of identifying patients at risk of sudden cardiac death outweighs the risk of cost and false results </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Caregiver may decide not to have testing performed </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Strength: <strong>Weak recommendation</strong> (because of equilibrium between benefits and harms) </li>
</ul>
<p>1G. Clinicians should not obtain an echocardiogram in infants presenting with lower-risk BRUE (<strong>Grade C, Moderate Recommendation</strong>)</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade C</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, caregiver/infant anxiety, and sedation risk; avoid consequences of false-positive results </li>
    <li>Risks, harm, cost: May miss rare diagnosis of cardiac disease </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: The benefits of reducing unnecessary testing and sedation risk, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety, outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for cardiac causes </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Abnormal cardiac physical examination reflects the clinical judgment of the clinician </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Some caregivers may prefer to have echocardiography performed </li>

The subcommittee partnered with the Society of Hospital Medicine Expert Panel and a librarian to update the original systematic review with articles published through December 31, 2014, with the use of the same methodology as the original systematic review. PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies involving children younger than 24 months by using the stepwise approach specified in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Search terms included &quot;ALTE(s),&quot; &quot;apparent life threatening event(s),&quot; &quot;life threatening event(s),&quot; &quot;near miss SIDS&quot; or &quot;near miss sudden infant death syndrome,&quot; &quot;aborted crib death&quot; or &quot;aborted sudden infant death syndrome,&quot; and &quot;aborted SIDS&quot; or &quot;aborted cot death&quot; or &quot;infant death, sudden.&quot; The Medical Subject Heading &quot;infantile apparent life threatening event,&quot; introduced in 2011, was also searched but did not identify additional articles.</p>
<p>In updating the systematic review published in 2012, pairs of 2 subcommittee members used validated methodology to independently score the newly identified abstracts from English language articles (n=120) for relevance to the clinical questions (Supplemental Fig. 3 in the Supplemental Information [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In July 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a multidisciplinary subcommittee composed of primary care clinicians and experts in the fields of general pediatrics, hospital medicine, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, child abuse, sleep medicine, pulmonary medicine, cardiology, neurology, biochemical genetics, gastroenterology, environmental health, and quality improvement. The subcommittee also included a parent representative, a guideline methodologist/informatician, and an epidemiologist skilled in systematic reviews. The subcommittee performed a comprehensive review of the literature related to apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) from 1970 through 2014.</p>
<p>The resulting systematic review was used to develop the guideline recommendations by following the policy statement from the AAP Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management, &quot;Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice Guidelines.&quot; Decisions and the strength of recommendations were based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence from the updated literature review by 2 independent reviewers and incorporation of a previous systematic review. Expert consensus was used when definitive data were not available. If committee members disagreed with the rest of the consensus, they were encouraged to voice their concern until full agreement was reached. If full agreement could not be reached, each committee member reserved the right to state concern or disagreement in the publication (which did not occur). Because the recommendations of this guideline were based on the ALTE literature, the subcommittee relied on the studies and outcomes that could be attributable to the new definition of lower- or higher-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) patients.</p>
<p>Key action statements were generated by using BRIDGE-Wiz (Building Recommendations in a Developers Guideline Editor), an interactive software tool that leads guideline development teams through a series of questions that are intended to create clear, transparent, and actionable key action statements. BRIDGE-Wiz integrates the quality of available evidence and a benefit harm assessment into the final determination of the strength of each recommendation. Evidence-based guideline recommendations from the AAP may be graded as strong, moderate, weak based on low-quality evidence, or weak based on balance between benefits and harms. Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with &quot;should&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; recommendation statements, whereas weak recommendation may be recognized by use of &quot;may&quot; or &quot;need not&quot; (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

Further support will be sought from stakeholder organizations (American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Board of Pediatrics, Society of Hospital Medicine). A Web-based toolkit (to be published online) will include caregiver handouts and a shared decision-making tool to facilitate patient- and family-centered care. Efforts will address appropriate disease classification and diagnosis coding. </p>
<p><strong>Integration of Clinical Workflow</strong></p>
<p>An algorithm is provided (Figure 1 in the original guideline document) for diagnosis and management. Structured history and physical examination templates also are provided to assist in addressing all of the relevant risk factors for brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) (see Tables 2 and 3 in the original guideline document). Order sets and modified documents will be hosted on a Web-based learning platform that promotes crowd-sourcing. </p>
<p><strong>Administrative and Research</strong></p>
<p>International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, diagnostic codes are used for billing, quality improvement, and research; and new codes for lower- and higher-risk BRUEs will need to be developed. In the interim, the current code for an&amp;nbsp;apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) (799.82) will need to be used for billing purposes. Efforts will be made to better reflect present knowledge and to educate clinicians and payers in appropriate use of codes for this condition. </p>
<p><strong>Quality Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Quality improvement initiatives that provide Maintenance of Certification credit, such as the AAP's PREP and EQIPP courses, or collaborative opportunities through the AAP's Quality Improvement Innovation Networks, will engage clinicians in the use and improvement of the guideline. By using proposed quality measures, adherence and outcomes can be assessed and benchmarked with others to inform continual improvement efforts. Proposed measures include process evaluation (use of definition and evaluation), outcome assessment (family experience and diagnostic outcomes), and balancing issues (cost and length of visit). Future research will need to be conducted to validate any measures.</p></div>"/>
