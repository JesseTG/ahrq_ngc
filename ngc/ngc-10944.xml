	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Is the Indication of Vancomycin Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: TDM should be performed in patients who receive concomitant nephrotoxic agents, who are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) or are obese, and those who have burns or impaired renal function. (<strong>1C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: TDM should be performed in elderly patients and patients with concomitant hepatic diseases. (<strong>2C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Which Variables Should Be Used to Monitor Vancomycin Efficacy and Renal Safety?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: Trough serum vancomycin concentrations should be monitored to ensure vancomycin efficacy and renal safety. (<strong>1C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Is the Target Trough Concentration of Vancomycin?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>: Trough serum vancomycin concentrations should be maintained at 10-15 mg/L in adult patients. (<strong>1C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>: Trough serum vancomycin concentrations should be maintained at 10-20 mg/L in adult patients with serious methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) infections. (<strong>2C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>When to Start Initial Vancomycin TDM?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong>: Initial vancomycin TDM should be started on day 3 (48 hours since initiation of vancomycin therapy) for patients with normal renal function. (<strong>2D</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong>: Initial vancomycin TDM should be started after 72 hours of vancomycin therapy for patients with impaired renal function. (<strong>1B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>How Should the Vancomycin Dose Be Administered and Adjusted?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong>: Vancomycin dosage should be administered and adjusted individually based on population pharmacokinetic method. (<strong>2D</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Is an Initial Loading Dose Needed?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9</strong>: An initial loading dose should be given for adult patients with serious MRSA infections. (<strong>2D</strong>) </p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Retrieval and Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Databases Searched</strong></p>
<p>The literature was systematically searched (until January 16, 2014) in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and three Chinese literature databases (CNKI, CBM and WanFang). </p>
<p><strong>Search Terms</strong></p>
<p>The search terms were a combination of text free terms and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms such as &quot;Vancomycin&quot;. The group also used the search terms &quot;human&quot; in PubMed and &quot;human and (case report or clinical article or clinical protocol or clinical trial or cohort analysis or comparative study or controlled clinical trial or controlled study or major clinical study or medical record review or meta-analysis or multicenter study or observational study or outcomes research or practice guideline or prospective study or randomized controlled trial or retrospective study or systematic review) and (article or article in press or conference paper or conference review or review or short survey) and (bacteremia or bacterial endocarditis or bacterial infection or bacterial meningitis or catheter infection or diarrhea or endophthalmitis or fever or hospital infection or infection or kidney failure or methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus infection or nephrotoxicity or neutropenia or osteomyelitis or pneumonia or postoperative infection or sepsis or side effect or skin infection or staphylococcus infection or urinary tract infection)&quot; in EMBASE. </p>
<p><strong>Pilot Search</strong></p>
<p>To ensure the consistency of the literature selection standards, the authors of the systematic reviews conducted a pre-test. They randomly selected 64 bibliographical references for the pre-test. By summarizing the results of the literature selection and discussing the inconsistencies, all of the authors had a definite understanding of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Selection</strong></p>
<p>A total of 67,406 studies were identified, of which 21,621 were duplicate articles. After excluding 44842 studies that were not relevant using the titles and abstracts, 943 studies were included for full-text reading. Sixteen pharmacists, who were divided into 8 groups, performed the literature selection and reading.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of a body of evidence and to develop and report recommendations. According to the GRADE approach, the quality of evidence is categorized as high, moderate, low or very low. Randomized controlled trials are categorized as high-quality evidence, and observational studies are categorized as low-quality evidence. The assessment of evidence was conducted across studies on an outcome-by-outcome basis. The guideline methodologists were responsible for quality assessment, drafting the evidence summaries and presenting these summaries at the Guideline Development Group meeting.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Patients' Values and Preferences</strong></span></p>
<p>Patients' values and preferences were investigated regarding vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The results of the investigation were analyzed and considered by the Guideline Steering Group and the Guideline Development Group when the recommendations were formulated. See <em>Values and Preferences in Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Vancomycin in Infectious Patients</em> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for a detailed description of the survey and results.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The guideline was launched at the Chinese Third Annual Conference of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in Shanghai by the Peking University TDM and Clinical Toxicology Center and the Division of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Chinese Pharmacological Society in July 2013. Methodological support was provided by the Chinese GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Evaluation and Development) Center. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Guideline Development Group and Guideline Steering Group</strong></span></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group, the Guideline Steering Group, and the Guideline Secretary Group were established in July 2013. To ensure fair representation by gender and region, the Guideline Development Group consists of 30 members from multiple fields of subjects, as follows: 17 clinical pharmacists, 2 respiratory physicians, 1 infectious diseases physician, 2 evidence-based medical experts, 2 medical laboratory scientists, 2 microbiologists, 1 pharmacologist, and 1 pharmacoeconomist, 1 pediatric physician and 1 nurse. The mission of the Guideline Development Group is as follows: (1) to define the scope of the guideline, draft the PICOs (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) and choose and rate the outcomes; (2) to grade the quality of the evidence; (3) to draft preliminary recommendations; (4) to write the draft guideline; and (5) to publish and promote the guideline. The Guideline Steering Group consists of 8 members, including 1 pharmacologist, 1 evidence-based medical expert, 3 clinical pharmacists, 2 respiratory physicians and 1 infectious diseases physician. The mission of the Guideline Steering Group is as follows: (1) to approve the PICOs; (2) to supervise the literature search and systematic reviews; (3) to check the grade of the evidence; (4) to draft the final recommendations using a modified Delphi approach; and (5) to approve the publication of the guideline. The Guideline Secretary Group is responsible for conducting systematic reviews and investigation of patients' views and preferences.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Formulating Questions and Choosing Outcomes</strong></span></p>
<p>After its proposal by the Guideline Development Group and approval by the Guideline Steering Group, the PICOs were finalized. The Guideline Development Group chose the outcomes and rated them by their importance. The scores of the outcomes ranged from 1-9; on this scale, 7-9 is considered critical, 4-6 is important, and 1-3 is not important. For this guideline, the mortality rate, the treatment efficacy rate (the rate of clinical efficacy, treatment failure or treatment success) and the rate of nephrotoxicity are considered critical; the cost-effectiveness and the proportions of the vancomycin target concentrations that are reached are considered important; and the pharmacokinetic parameters (the half-life, volume of distribution, clearance and area under curve [AUC]), trough concentrations, the length of hospital stay, the length of vancomycin therapy and the microbiological eradication rates are considered not important.</p>
<p>The 12 questions and associated PICOs are listed in the guideline protocol document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Developing Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>After completion of the GRADE evidence profile, the Guideline Development Group drafted preliminary recommendations based on the quality of the evidence, the balance between the benefits and the harms, the patients' values and preferences and the health resources. The Guideline Development Group developed the draft recommendations through 2-4 rounds of the Delphi process and submitted the draft recommendations to the Guideline Steering Group for final approval. The group referred to the GRADE Grid to reach consensus. Five choices, including &quot;Strong recommendation&quot;, &quot;Weak recommendation&quot;, &quot;Unclear recommendation&quot;, &quot;Weak disrecommendation&quot;, and &quot;Strong disrecommendation&quot; were used for each draft item on the questionnaire. For each item, if more than 50% of the experts voted for any choice except the &quot;unclear&quot; one or if more than 70% of the experts voted for one of the 2 choices on the same side, this meant that consensus on the item had been reached. Otherwise, the item was deemed controversial and would need one more round of the Delphi process.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>See <em>Economic Evaluation of Vancomycin Therapeutic Drug Monitoring: a Systematic Review</em> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), which reviewed five previously published economic studies. Three studies reported cost-effectiveness analyses and two were cost-benefit analyses. Two studies calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness of vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The review concluded that whether vancomycin TDM has economic advantages depends on the patients' preexisting renal function and their comorbid conditions. Patients with a higher risk of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity may benefit from TDM from an economic perspective; however, the available evidence is of low quality. Additionally, well-designed economic evaluation studies are needed to further inform the value of TDM.</p>
