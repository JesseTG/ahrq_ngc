	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li>Discharge patients with solid nodules that show stability (&amp;lt;25% change in volume) on CT after 1 year. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>If two-dimensional diameter measurements are used to assess growth, follow-up with CT for a total of 2 years. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>

    <li>Discuss the options of observation with repeat CT, CT-guided biopsy, or resection/non-surgical treatment with the patient where the risk of malignancy is approximately &amp;gt;10%; consider factors such as age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider using changes in mass of SSNs to accurately assess growth. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider resection/non-surgical treatment or observation for pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs) that enlarge &amp;ge;2 mm in maximum diameter; if observed, repeat CT after a maximum of 6 months. Take into account patient choice, age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Favour resection/non-surgical treatment over observation for part-solid nodules (PSNs) that show enlargement of the solid component, or for pGGNs that develop a solid component. Take into account patient choice, age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Favour resection/non-surgical treatment over observation where malignancy is pathologically proven. Take into account patient choice, age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Further Imaging in Management of Pulmonary Nodules</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Offer a positron emission tomography&amp;ndash;computed tomography (PET-CT) scan to patients with a pulmonary nodule with an initial risk of malignancy of &amp;gt;10% (Brock model) where the nodule size is greater than the local PET-CT detection threshold. (<strong>B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ensure that PET-CT reports include the method of analysis. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use qualitative assessment with an ordinal scale to deﬁne fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake as absent, faint, moderate or high using the following guide:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Absent&amp;mdash;uptake indiscernible from background lung tissue </li>
        <li>Faint&amp;mdash;uptake less than or equal to mediastinal blood pool </li>
        <li>Moderate&amp;mdash;uptake greater than mediastinal blood pool </li>
        <li>Intense&amp;mdash;uptake markedly greater than mediastinal blood pool (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reassess risk after PET-CT using the Herder prediction tool. (<strong>B</strong>) </li>
    <li>After reassessment of risk:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

<p>Clinical questions were structured in the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Control, Outcome) format, to deﬁne the scope of the guideline and inform the literature search (see supplementary appendix 1 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p>Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline. For each topic area the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), Ovid EMBASE and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) from 1980.</p>
<p>The searches were ﬁrst run in November 2012 and updated in June 2014 (see supplementary appendix 2 for search strategy [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Searches included a combination of indexed terms and free text terms and were limited to English language publications only. The initial search identiﬁed 6819 potential abstracts and the second search 2739.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Appraisal of Literature</strong></span></p>
<p>Appraisal was performed to be compliant with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) collaboration. Two individuals read the title and abstract of each article retrieved by the literature searches and decided whether the paper was deﬁnitely relevant, possibly relevant or not relevant to the project. Criteria formulated for categorizing the abstracts into these three groups were:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Whether the study dealt with the clinical question </li>
    <li>Whether the appropriate study type was used to produce the best evidence to answer the clinical question </li>
    <li>Review articles were excluded </li>
    <li>Abstract was in English </li>
    <li>Abstracts were reviewed irrespective of the journal of publication, country in which the research was performed or published and the date of publication</li>
</ul>
<p>The full paper was obtained for all relevant or possibly relevant abstracts and allocated to the relevant section(s) of the guideline.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst screening process identiﬁed 2021 of the initial 6819 reference abstracts to be deﬁnitely or possibly relevant to the guideline.</p>
<p>The second literature search in June 2014 yielded 2739 abstracts of which 1611 were possibly or deﬁnitely relevant. Four members of the group sorted the references into subject groups and these were forwarded to the pairs of reviewers for each group.</p></div>"/>

The methodology used to write the guideline adheres strictly to the criteria as set out by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) collaboration, which is available online (<a href=&quot;http://www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-ii/&quot; title=&quot;AGREE Web site&quot;>http://www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-ii/</a>).

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Considered Judgement and Grading of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) used the evidence tables to judge the body of evidence and grade recommendations for this guideline. Evidence tables are available in supplementary appendix 3 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Where evidence was lacking to answer the formulated clinical questions, expert opinions were obtained through consensus. The following were considered in grading of the recommendations:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The available volume of the body of evidence </li>
    <li>How applicable the obtained evidence was in making recommendations for the deﬁned target audience of this guideline </li>
    <li>Whether the evidence was generalisable to the target population for the guideline </li>
    <li>Whether there was clear consistency in the evidence obtained to support recommendations </li>
    <li>What the implications of recommendations would be on clinical practice in terms of resources and skilled expertise </li>
    <li>Cost-effectiveness was not reviewed in detail as in-depth economic analysis of recommendations fell beyond the scope of this guideline</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations were graded from A to D according to the strength of the evidence as shown in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field. In line with Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidance, 'minus' evidence was considered in context but in the absence of other 'plus' supporting evidence, it was discussed by the GDG and any recommendation hence made was grade D. Important practical points lacking any research evidence, and not likely to be obtained by research evidence were highlighted as 'good practice points'. Recommendations for further research are designated 'RR'.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Drafting the Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The GDG corresponded regularly by email, and meetings of the full group were held in February, May and November 2012, February, April, June and October 2013, February and June 2014.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Risk of false-positive and false-negative imaging and biopsy results </li>
    <li>Lesion detection on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans is adversely affected by breathing artefact, particularly peripheral lesions and those just above the diaphragm, the latter additionally affected by scatter artefact from the liver. </li>
    <li>Pneumothorax is the most common complication of CT-guided biopsies; by far the largest study showed an incidence of 15%, with 6.6% of patients requiring an intercostal drain insertion. Consistent factors that increase the risk are lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and presence of emphysema along the needle tract. </li>
    <li>The frequency of complications in case series of patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was as follows: pneumothorax was the most commonly reported complication with rates varying from 9% to 54% in 19 case series. Other reported complications after RFA were bleeding (0.7%&amp;ndash;26%), pleural effusion (1.8%&amp;ndash;19%), pneumonia (1.8%&amp;ndash;12%), pleuritis (0.6%&amp;ndash;4.3%), lung abscess (0.3%&amp;ndash;3.1%), haemothorax (3.0%), severe pain (2%), bronchopleural ﬁstula (1.5%&amp;ndash;1.8%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1.5%) and pericardial tamponade (0.9%). Procedure-related mortality varied from 0% to 0.9% in seven case series, although one series reported a 30-day procedure-related mortality of 2.6%. </li>
    <li>The main acute toxicities of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) are fatigue, chest pain, skin erythema and cough, but these side effects are almost always mild (&amp;lt;grade 3) and self-limiting. Severe radiation pneumonitis&amp;mdash;that is, grade 3 (requiring oxygen, severe symptoms&amp;plusmn;limiting self-care), is uncommon (range 1%&amp;ndash;2.8%) and grade 2 (symptomatic requiring medical intervention&amp;plusmn;limiting activities of daily living) or less ranges from 1% to 11%. The incidence of radiation pneumonitis does not appear to be higher in patients with poor pulmonary function. Rib fracture and chest wall pain are the main late side effects with varying incidence depending on the dose fractionation scheme used. </li>
    <li>The ﬁnding of a pulmonary nodule has an adverse impact on quality of life.
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Patients commonly assume that the ﬁnding of a nodule means that they have cancer. </li>
        <li>Patients may be frustrated if healthcare providers fail to deal with their concerns about cancer or potential adverse effects of surveillance. </li>
        <li>Effective communication by the healthcare team can reduce the impact on quality of life after diagnosis of a pulmonary nodule. </li>
