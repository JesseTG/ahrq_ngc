<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>In hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients, at what hemoglobin concentration should a decision to transfuse red blood cells (RBCs) be considered?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The AABB recommends adhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy. </li>
    <li>In adult and pediatric intensive care unit patients, transfusion should be considered at hemoglobin concentrations of 7 g/dL or less. </li>
    <li>In postoperative surgical patients, transfusion should be considered at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL or less or for symptoms (chest pain, orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, or congestive heart failure). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: high; strength of recommendation: strong</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, at what hemoglobin concentration should a decision to transfuse RBCs be considered?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The AABB suggests adhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy. </li>
    <li>Transfusion should be considered at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL or less or for symptoms (chest pain, orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, or congestive heart failure). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: weak</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients with the acute coronary syndrome, at what hemoglobin concentration should an RBC transfusion be considered?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The AABB cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive RBC transfusion threshold. Further research is needed to determine the optimal threshold.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: uncertain</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>In hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients, should transfusion be guided by symptoms rather than hemoglobin concentration?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The AABB suggests that transfusion decisions be influenced by symptoms as well as hemoglobin concentration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: weak</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong> - Indicates considerable confidence in the estimate of effect. The true effect probably lies close to the estimated effect, and future research is unlikely to change the estimate of the health intervention's effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> - Indicates confidence that the estimate is close to the truth. Further research is likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate of the health intervention's effect.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> - Indicates that confidence in the effect is limited. The true effect may differ substantially from the estimate, and further research is likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Very low</strong> - Indicates little confidence in the effect estimate. Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of recommendations (for or against intervention) is graded as &quot;strong&quot; (indicating judgment that most well-informed people will make the same choice; &quot;The AABB recommends. . .&quot;), &quot;weak&quot; (indicating judgment that a majority of well-informed people will make the same choice, but a substantial minority will not; &quot;The AABB suggests . . .&quot;), or &quot;uncertain&quot; (indicating that the panel made no specific recommendation for or against interventions; &quot;The AABB&quot; cannot recommend . . .&quot;).</p></div>"/>

<p>The search for trials was not restricted by date, language or publication status.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Searches</strong></p>
<p>The Cochrane Injuries Group Trials Search Coordinator conducted the latest search for trials and collated the results. The following databases were searched:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialized Register (searched 1 February 2011) </li>
    <li>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<em>The Cochrane Library</em> 2011, Issue 1) </li>
    <li>MEDLINE (Ovid) 1950 to January Week 3 2011 </li>
    <li>EMBASE (Ovid) 1980 to 2011 Week 04 </li>
    <li>Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to February 2011) </li>
    <li>ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to February 2011) </li>
</ul>
<p>The search strategies are presented in Appendix 1 in the systematic review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Searching Other Resources</strong></p>
<p>Experts in the field were contacted to identify information relevant to the review. Where possible, authors of published studies were contacted for clarification of trial methodology and data. This was only possible where a contact address was reported in the published study. The reference lists of relevant reviews and published papers as well as the reference lists of all included trials were searched for further studies.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Studies</strong></p>
<p>Two authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, or both, of the search results and selected trials that met the previously defined inclusion criteria. The authors discussed inclusion of studies until consensus was reached; there were no disagreements on the inclusion of studies. The authors identified trials in which patients were randomized to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion threshold and/or protocol), or to a control group which was randomized to a liberal transfusion strategy. The two authors independently extracted study characteristics and outcomes using a data extraction form. The extraction form recorded information regarding: study type, methodology descriptions, the presence of a transfusion threshold, transfusion protocol, the type of surgery involved, clinical setting, treatment outcomes and general comments.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Criteria for Considering Studies for the Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of Studies</strong></p>
<p>Randomized controlled trials with a concurrent control group. The reviewers included trials if the comparison groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger' or 'threshold, described as a hemoglobin or hematocrit level (with or without a specified level of hemodynamic instability) that had to be reached before a red cell transfusion was administered. Control group patients were required to be either transfused with allogeneic and/or autologous red blood cells (RBCs) at higher hemoglobin or hematocrit levels (transfusion threshold) than the intervention group or transfused in accordance with current transfusion practices, which may not have included a well-defined transfusion threshold, but involved liberal rather than restrictive transfusion practices.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Participants</strong></p>
<p>Trials of surgical or medical patients, involving adults and/or children, were included. Neonates were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Interventions</strong></p>
<p>The intervention considered was the use of transfusion thresholds ('triggers') as a means of guiding allogeneic and/or autologous RBC transfusion.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary Outcomes</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

<p>Two authors performed data extraction on articles that met the inclusion criteria. One author then entered data into Review Manager; data were checked by the second author. The panel contacted authors of trials to request missing data.</p>
<p>A data extraction form was used to record data on the following outcomes: the number of patients exposed to allogeneic blood, the amount of allogeneic blood transfused, the number of patients receiving any transfusion (allogeneic blood, autologous blood, or both). For trials involving surgical patients, the following outcomes were recorded: postoperative complications (infection, hemorrhage, non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac events, renal failure, stroke, thromboembolism, pulmonary edema, mental confusion), mortality and length of hospital stay (LOS). Data for blood loss and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (on admission, pre-post transfusion and at discharge) were recorded on the data extraction form as well as information regarding demographics (age, sex), type of surgery or medical condition. Data for allogeneic blood transfusion was extracted if it was expressed as packed red blood cells (RBCs). Information regarding the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or platelets was documented.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias is described in Section 8.5 of the <em>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</em>.</p>
<p>Two authors assessed the following domains for each study:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Sequence generation </li>
    <li>Allocation concealment </li>
    <li>Blinding </li>
    <li>Incomplete outcome data </li>
    <li>Selective outcome reporting </li>
    <li>Other potential sources of bias </li>
</ul>
<p>A &quot;Risk of bias&quot; table was completed for each study, incorporating a description of the study's performance against each of the above domains and the overall judgement of the risk of bias for each entry as follows: 'Low', 'Unclear' (indicating unclear or unknown risk of bias) and 'High' risk of bias.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Measures of Treatment Effect</span></strong></p>
<p>The risk ratio for allogeneic blood transfusion in the intervention group as compared with the control group and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each trial using the random-effects model (Der Simonian, 1986). A similar approach was adopted to examine the other outcomes of transfusion. The mean number of units of RBCs transfused to each group and the corresponding standard deviations were also entered. The mean difference (MD) and 95% CIs were used to express the average reduction in the number of units of RBC administered to the intervention group, compared with the control.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Unit of Analysis Issues</span></strong></p>
<p>The unit of analysis was the patient. Data expressed in milliliters (ml) for the volume of blood transfused were converted to units of blood by dividing by 300.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Dealing with Missing Data</span></strong></p>
<p>All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. No missing data were imputed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Heterogeneity</span></strong></p>
<p>There was significant clinical heterogeneity. The trials included surgical, medical and critical care patients. The data for all outcomes were pooled and presented data stratified by subgroups for the primary outcome only. The subgroups evaluated were allogeneic transfusion, autologous transfusion and clinical settings (cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery, acute blood loss/trauma, cancer and critical care). Reviewers also examined the proportion of patients exposed to transfusion stratified by the transfusion threshold (difference &amp;ge;2 g/dL, &amp;lt;2 g/dL), risk of bias and units of blood transfused.</p>
<p>Statistical heterogeneity was examined using both the I<sup>2</sup> statistic and Chi<sup>2</sup> test. The I<sup>2</sup> statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity and larger values show increasing heterogeneity; substantial heterogeneity is considered to exist when the I<sup>2</sup> &amp;gt;50%. For the Chi<sup>2</sup> test, a P value of &amp;lt;0.10 was used to indicate the presence of statistically significant heterogeneity.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Reporting Biases</span></strong></p>
<p>Funnel plots were examined for evidence of publication bias. Although the small number of trials hampered funnel plot assessment, the outcome with the largest data set could be assessed for the presence of publication bias. The funnel plot for this outcome is presented in Figure 1 in the systematic review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>Due to the anticipated significant clinical heterogeneity of the trials, data were analyzed using a random-effects model.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed using Review Manager software. Data were entered into Review Manager on the numbers of patients exposed to allogeneic blood and the numbers of patients in each treatment group. Data in ml were converted to units by dividing by 300. Studies reporting hematocrit were converted to hemoglobin concentration by dividing by three.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Subgroup Analysis and Investigation of Heterogeneity</span></strong></p>
<p>Subgroup analyses were performed to explore treatment effects by blood product (allogeneic versus autologous, units of blood transfused), clinical setting (cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery, cute blood loss/trauma, cancer, critical care), transfusion threshold (difference &amp;ge;2 grams per deciliter and difference less than 2 grams per deciliter) and risk of bias.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Sensitivity Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects of study allocation concealment on the results.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>A committee of 20 experts was assembled. Twelve were current or former members of the AABB Clinical Transfusion Medicine Committee, whereas 6 were appointed by their respective professional organizations as subject matter experts. Fifteen of the physicians were pathologists or hematologists, most of whom had subspecialty expertise in transfusion medicine. The others included an anesthesiologist; a cardiologist; a pediatrician; experts in critical care medicine; trauma surgeons; specialists in internal medicine and systematic review; and a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodologist.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel used the GRADE methodology to develop these guidelines. They prepared evidence profiles that display information on the effect of RBC transfusion in terms of benefits and harms for the most important clinical outcomes. The profiles also contained information on study limitations, consistency, directness, precision, and reporting bias. For each question or indication, the panel rated the importance of each outcome in influencing the decision to administer a transfusion to a patient. The outcomes were scored from 1 (not critical to making a decision) to 9 (critical to making a decision). The panel also rated the quality of evidence across all outcomes. The overall quality of the trials for each outcome was first assessed by 2 of the authors, after which a consensus of the entire panel was adopted. Each member of the panel was asked to make his or her final judgment on the strength of each recommendation and the overall quality of the body of evidence. The final quality rating and the strength of each recommendation were reached by consensus during an in-person meeting with the panel members.</p>

    <li>These guidelines focus on hemoglobin concentration thresholds and other clinical variables that might trigger red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Practice guidelines are not intended as standards or absolute requirements and do not apply to all individual transfusion decisions. Clinical judgment is critical in the decision to transfuse; therefore, transfusing RBCs above or below the specified hemoglobin threshold may be dictated by the clinical context. Similarly, the decision not to transfuse RBCs to a patient with a hemoglobin concentration below the recommended thresholds is also a matter of clinical judgment. </li>
    <li>The strength of the recommendations included in these guidelines is limited by the paucity of clinical trial data in certain patient populations. The results of the 3 largest trials (TRICC, TRIPICU, and FOCUS) have not been replicated and do not include patients from many other populations who frequently receive transfusions. Clinical trials are needed in other patient populations that include (but are not limited to) patients with the acute coronary syndrome, elderly medical patients recovering from illnesses that result in hospitalization, patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, transfusion-dependent patients, patients with coagulopathy or hemorrhagic shock, and patients with traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, trials are needed to examine lower transfusion thresholds (for example, 6 g/dL), because the current evidence has examined thresholds of 7 g/dL in intensive care unit patients and 8 g/dL in other populations. This relative lack of clinical trial data is a barrier to wider acceptance of these guidelines. </li>
    <li>Guidelines cannot account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to specific patients or special clinical situations. Accordingly, the AABB considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's unique circumstances. </li>
