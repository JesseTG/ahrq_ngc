	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>For patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer choosing EBRT with or without androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), brachytherapy boost (LDR or high-dose rate [HDR]) should be offered to eligible patients. For low-intermediate risk prostate cancer (Gleason 7, prostate-specific antigen, 10 ng/mL or Gleason 6, prostate-specific antigen, 10 to 20 ng/mL) LDR brachytherapy alone may be offered as monotherapy. For patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving EBRT and ADT, brachytherapy boost (LDR or HDR) should be offered to eligible patients. </li>
    <li><sup>125</sup>I and <sup>103</sup>PD are each reasonable isotope options for patients receiving LDR brachytherapy; no recommendation can be made for or against using <sup>131</sup>Cs or HDR monotherapy. </li>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a &quot;signals&quot; approach to facilitate guideline updating. This approach is intended to identify new, potentially practice-changing data&amp;mdash;signals&amp;mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. The Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provides additional information about the signals approach.</p>
<p>For this update, the signal was the presentation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing dose-escalated (DE)-external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy boost (LDR-B) that could potentially expand the patient population to whom the original recommendations would apply. The full Update Committee was then convened to review the evidence.</p>
<p>Evidence was also collected through a systematic review of the medical literature. Publications were included if they were phase III randomized clinical trials of brachytherapy compared with either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) in men with prostate cancer. These publications were identified by rerunning the original strategy in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, for the period from the original search in 2011 through to the end of August 2015. A final search for important papers was made in December 2016.</p>
<p>Further details on the search strategy and results are provided in Data Supplements 2 and 3 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) convened an Update Panel with multidisciplinary representation in radiation oncology, medical oncology, urology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Panel was led by two Co-Chairs (one from each organization) who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline product, the Co-Chairs selected additional members to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Update Panel held teleconferences on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Update Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software.&amp;trade; This method helps Guideline Expert Panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Expert Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recognizes that there is often a wide array of choices for treating many cancer types, with often a wide disparity in cost to patients and payers (despite much difference in effectiveness or toxicity). One study reported that of the radiation modalities used in the treatment of prostate cancer, from the Medicare payer perspective, low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy is the cheapest (compared with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy [SABR], external beam radiation therapy [EBRT], or protons). Another study showed that in the Canadian health care context, SABR had the higher quality-adjusted life-years and was more cost effective compared with LDR (and both were better than EBRT). Further work is needed to articulate cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility differences between the various prostate cancer treatment approaches.</p></div>"/>
