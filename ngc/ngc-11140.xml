	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacological Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Motor Symptoms</strong></p>
<p><em>Antiparkinson Drugs</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered</span>: Is non-oral administration of antiparkinson treatments (dopaminergics and anticholinergics) used for motor symptoms safer and more effective?</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The use of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is recommended only for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) with severe motor fluctuations and hyper/dyskinesia when the available combinations of the Parkinson's medications have not produced satisfactory results. This alternative may be cost effective with the conditions established within the framework of usage of orphan drugs.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Evaluation of antiparkinson treatment with transdermal rotigotine is recommended for patients with early or initial PD, at the doses specified in the product sheet, when other alternatives are ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Intermittent injections of apomorphine may be used to reduce motor fluctuations (<em>&quot;on-off&quot;</em> phenomena) in patients with PD in which symptoms are not controlled sufficiently by oral antiparkinson medication.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Continuous subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine may be used to reduce <em>off</em> time and dyskinesia in persons with PD and severe motor complications. This should only be initiated in expert units with facilities to allow adequate supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Problems Related to Antiparkinson Medications</strong></p>
<p><em>Drug-induced Psychosis</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered</span>: Is it more effective and safer to add an atypical antipsychotic (for example: quetiapine) to antiparkinson medication or reduce/discontinue these antiparkinson drugs (anticholinergics, selegiline, amantadine) to control the drug-induced psychosis associated with this disease?</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - All persons with PD and psychosis should receive a general medical evaluation, in order to exclude other treatable causes of psychosis.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Before considering the use of anti-psychotic medication, treatment for any precipitant condition is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The gradual discontinuation of antiparkinson medication that could trigger psychosis in persons with PD must be taken into account.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It may not be necessary to treat moderate psychotic symptoms in persons with PD if they are tolerated well by the patient and the caregiver.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Typical antipsychotics (such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones) should not be used in persons with PD because they may exacerbate the motor characteristics of PD.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Atypical antipsychotics may be considered for treatment of psychotic symptoms in persons with PD, although the evidence of its efficacy and safety is limited.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - The use of clozapine at the minimum effective dose is indicated in patients who develop psychotic disorders over the course of their PD, in cases in which standard treatment has failed.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When treatment with clozapine is applied, weekly monitoring is recommended during the first 18 weeks of treatment, followed by monitoring for as long as the treatment is continued (at least once every 4 weeks). These analytical controls should be continued for 4 weeks after complete interruption of the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with PD with clozapine requires the mandatory registration of the monitoring scenario of the atypical antipsychotic and of blood parameters (total white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count). For more information, see the product sheet (<a href=&quot;http://www.aemps.gob.es/&quot; title=&quot;AEMPS Web site&quot;>http://www.aemps.gob.es/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The use of low doses of quetiapine may be considered as an alternative antipsychotic to clozapine for the treatment of patients with psychosis in PD, when weekly routine blood monitoring is not possible, and within the framework of Royal Decree 1015/2009, dated 19 June, regulating the availability of medications in special situations.</p>
<p><em>Sleep Disorders</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered:</span> Which treatment is safest and most effective to reduce the sleep disorders associated with PD?</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) must be aimed at finding a reversible cause, such as depression, poor sleep hygiene, or medications, associated with the altered sleep pattern.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Modafinil and melatonin are not recommended for the management of EDS associated with PD.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Modified-release levodopa products may be used for nocturnal akinesia in patients with PD.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The sleep history of the patients with PD should be recorded to document the sleep disorder.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Proper sleep hygiene is recommended for persons with PD and any sleep disorder, including:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Avoid intake of stimulants in the afternoon (e.g., coffee, tea, etc.) </li>
    <li>Establish a regular sleep pattern </li>
    <li>Comfortable bedroom temperature and setting </li>
    <li>Provide healthcare products, such as bed lifts or rails to assist with movement and turning, which helps make people more comfortable </li>
    <li>Restrict naps during the day </li>
    <li>Recommend regular and adequate exercise to sleep better </li>
    <li>Review all of the medication and avoid drugs that affect sleep or alertness, or that could interact with other medication (e.g., selegiline, antihistamines, H2 antagonists, antipsychotics, and sedatives) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Special care should be taken to identify and control sleep behaviour disorders, such as restless leg syndrome and the REM (rapid eye movement) phase in persons with PD and sleep disorders.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Persons with PD who have sleep attacks should be advised not to drive or expose themselves to occupational risks. An attempt should be made to adjust medication in order to reduce the occurrence of these attacks.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Patients should be advised to exercise caution with medication that could alter their ability to drive or operate machinery, and should read the information available on the packaging of this medication: the warning symbol or pictogram on the box (driving pictogram), which is supplemented by the information provided in the prospectus.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Persons with PD are recommended to maintain proper sleep hygiene, by doing physical exercise at least a few hours before going to sleep and using satin sheets to facilitate turning in bed.</p>
<p><em>Impulse Control Disorders</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered</span>: Which treatment is safest and most effective in controlling the impulse control disorders associated with the treatment of PD using dopamine agonists?</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The management of impulse control disorders (ICD) in patients with PD should include the consideration of the reduction or discontinuation of the use of dopamine agonists, using a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI), and probably psycho-social counseling and support.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Ergoline dopamine agonists should not be used as the first line of treatment of PD and ICD.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Switching between dopamine agonists in patients with PD and ICD is not recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When ergoline dopamine agonists are used, patients should follow:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A baseline screening echocardiography and regular follow-up scans to identify cardiac abnormalities </li>
    <li>Baseline laboratory investigation (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum creatinine) and radiological investigation (chest x-ray) with regular follow-up monitoring to identify serosal fibrosis </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Patients should be warned of the potential of dopamine agonists to cause ICD and EDS, and should be informed of the effects on driving and management of machinery.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Special attention should be given to detect signs of ICD in young male patients with PD and a prior history of behavioural disorders or addictive behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Healthcare workers should discuss the possible complications of ICD with the patients with PD who are taking dopamine agonists.</p>
<p><em>Cognitive Impairment</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered</span>: In adults with PD who develop initial cognitive impairment, is it safer and more effective to add an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, or modify dopaminergic treatment to improve cognitive functioning symptoms?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine in patients with idiopathic PD who present with mild to moderately severe dementia is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The evaluation of different intervention strategies, including cognitive stimulation is recommended to treat patients with PD who present with initial mild cognitive deterioration, before establishing specific pharmacological treatment with rivastigmine.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In patients with PD and cognitive impairment, the causes of dementia should be investigated, and if present, they should be treated.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The exclusion of any other non-Parkinson medication that acts on the central nervous system should be considered, with the discontinuation of anticholinergic medication, amantadine, selegiline, and dopamine agonists.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - A systematic review of the treatments prescribed for the management of the motor symptoms of PD is recommended, evaluating the indication, adherence, and interactions, in order to reduce the risk of adverse side-effects such as cognitive impairment, to reduce polypharmacy and agree upon treatments with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Non-motor Symptoms</strong></p>
<p><em>Sensory Symptoms</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered</span>: Which treatment is safest and most effective in controlling the alterations with sensory symptoms associated with PD? (e.g., visual alterations; olfactory dysfunction; taste alterations; hypoacusis and other auditory disorders; pain and associated sensitivity symptoms).</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is advisable to inform patients of the possible alterations with sensory symptoms associated with PD, in order to work on them as a team (patients, family members, and caregivers, along with the healthcare professionals) and reduce the impact of those alterations on the lives of the people affected by this disease.</p>
<p><em>Autonomic Dysfunctions</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question to Be Answered</span>: Which treatments are safest and most effective in controlling the autonomic dysfunctions associated with PD? (e.g., orthostatic hypotension; constipation; fecal incontinence; nausea and vomiting; hypersalivation; intolerance to heat; excessive sweating; nocturia; sexual dysfunction; weight loss; difficulty swallowing).</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Patients with PD should be advised to avoid the precipitating factors of orthostatic hypotension, such as sudden changes in posture, large meals, hot baths, and vasodilation medication.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Managing orthostatic hypotension in patients with PD is recommended, using non-pharmacological measures before initiating pharmacological treatment. Non-pharmacological measures include avoiding meals that are low in sodium and high in carbohydrates, increasing intake of water (2-2.5 l/d) and salt (&amp;gt;8 g or 150 mmol/d) in the diet, breaking up meals, exercise, elevating the head while sleeping, wearing compression stockings, or carrying out physical containment movements to increase blood pressure by increasing venous return and peripheral resistance, such as squatting, leaning forward, or crossing legs at the onset of presyncopal symptoms. Get out of bed slowly and stay seated in bed for a few seconds before standing.</p>

These were included as a secondary source of CPG evidence, to respond to specific sections of the guidelines, in accordance with the methodology proposed in the asthma guidelines of the Basque Country.</p>
<p>The guidelines included were evaluated using the instrument AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation). The methodological material of the guidelines presents the scores obtained after applying the instrument AGREE II to two CPGs on Parkinson's disease (PD) consulted during the preparation of the guidelines (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2006, and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN], 2010).</p>
<p>The minimum requirement established to constitute a source of evidence for this guideline was a score, using the AGREE Instrument, higher than 60% in domains 1, 3, and 6. The level of evidence established for the RCTs and SRs specified in the CPGs was maintained. In the second phase, an expanded search of original trials (mainly RCTs) was done, and for some questions, <a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/&quot; title=&quot;ClinicalTrials.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> was also consulted. A reverse search was done in the references of the articles identified and included in the CPGs. The authors of the studies were contacted directly when necessary. In addition, automatic e-mail alerts were defined for new studies included in Medline, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library.</p>
<p>The search reports were evaluated by at least two members of the guideline working group (GWG). The screening was done initially by title and summary. In a second screening, the discarded studies were recorded and the causes for exclusion were specified. The studies that were finally selected were evaluated using the critical reading tool of the Agency for Healthcare Technology Assessment of the Basque Country - OSTEBA.</p>
<p>For the question regarding the efficacy of physical therapy in persons with PD, general physical therapy was evaluated, and a non-systematic review was done for other techniques, such as music and dance, martial arts or tai-chi, among others.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The effectiveness of levodopa decreases over time. It has been calculated that five years after initiating treatment, a high percentage of patients develop what are known as motor fluctuations, characterised by the alternation of <em>&quot;on&quot;</em> periods and <em>&quot;off&quot;</em> periods. Over the years, these fluctuations may become more pronounced, which means that the periods of time during which the medication is ineffective become longer and less predictable. This is when the side effects caused by the levodopa appear: mental disorders, increased sex drive, lower blood pressure, digestive alterations. In addition, administration of levodopa over an extended period of time may facilitate the appearance of excessive abnormal involuntary movements that cannot be controlled by the patient. </li>
    <li>Some of the frequent adverse reactions to transdermal rotigotine include: sleep attacks/sudden sleep episodes, insomnia, sleep disorders, abnormal dreams, among others. </li>
    <li>Anticholinergics are indicated only in very specific cases and in patients younger than 70 years of age, due to the side effects, which include blurry vision, urine retention, and memory loss. </li>
    <li>Care must be taken when prescribing subcutaneous apomorphine because it could easily worsen pre-existing psychiatric symptoms. Nodes may appear at the point of subcutaneous injection. Other adverse events include: nausea, dyskinesia, recurring diarrhoea, confusion, mood swings, orthostatic hypotension, short-duration trembling of the legs, sweating and hot flashes, drowsiness, vertigo, eosinophilia, or lowered motor functioning at the end of the clinical effect compared with the basic level before the test, etc. </li>
    <li>Selegiline may have more side effects than rasagiline, including insomnia and hallucinations. </li>
    <li>There are two possible problems with the use of antidepressants to treat depression in patients with PD. These are the possibility of extrapyramidal symptoms (such as dystonia, akathisia, tremors, and parkinsonism), and the possibility of an adverse interaction with selegiline, an monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) inhibitor sometimes used in the treatment of PD. Although the use of SSRIs in PD with or without selegiline appears to be safe, caution is recommended when introducing these drugs. </li>
    <li>Clozapine has been associated with agranulocytosis, so regular monitoring of the total white blood cell count and the absolute neutrophil count is necessary for patients who are treated with this medication. In patients treated with clozapine, a significant increase in average resting heart rate, body weight, and drowsiness was reported. Treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with PD with clozapine requires the mandatory registration of the monitoring scenario of the atypical anti-psychotic and of blood parameters. </li>
    <li>Ergoline and non-ergoline dopamine agonists are associated with an increased risk of impulse control disorders (ICDs) which include ludopathy, binge eating, and hypersexuality. </li>
    <li>The following adverse effects were observed during exercises: discomfort or muscle pain, falls, wrist pain, dizziness or fainting. </li>
    <li>With the protein-redistribution diet, the following complications or side effects were detected: severe dyskinesia (which led to a reduction of the levodopa dose), moderate weight loss, and hunger before dinner. </li>

<p>Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are tools to assist professionals and users to make decisions regarding the most appropriate healthcare treatment. To improve the implementation of a CPG, in other words, its introduction into the clinical environment, it is helpful to design a series of strategies aimed at overcoming possible barriers to adoption.</p>
<p>The plan for the implementation of this CPG for the management of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) includes the following strategies:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Presentation of the CPG by the healthcare authorities to the communication media </li>
    <li>Presentation of the CPG to the different national associations and societies for neurology, family and community medicine, physical therapy and medicine, pharmacy, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, human nutrition and diet, etc. </li>
    <li>Presentation of the CPG to the pertinent regional associations </li>
    <li>Collaboration with scientific societies that have participated in the preparation of this CPG, to promote distribution </li>
    <li>Sending and distribution of the CPG to the different databases that collect information on CPGs, for evaluation and inclusion </li>
    <li>Contact with the Spanish Parkinson's Federation (FEP) and other associations of interested persons to present the guidelines to them. </li>
    <li>Free access to the different versions of the GPC at the <a href=&quot;http://portal.guiasalud.es/web/guest/home&quot; title=&quot;GuíaSalud Web site&quot;>Gu&amp;iacute;aSalud Web site</a>. </li>
    <li>Distribution of information on the CPG at scientific activities (conferences, congresses, meetings) related to neurology, family and community medicine, physical therapy and medicine, pharmacy, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, human nutrition and diet, etc. </li>
    <li>Information on the CPG in medical journals and magazines for the specialisations involved </li>
    <li>Publicising the existence and objectives of the CPG by means of mailing lists for professionals who would be potentially interested in it </li>
    <li>Translation of the complete version into English </li>
</ul>
<p>A study of the barriers and facilitators in the implementation of the CPG is recommended, with interventions in the area of the healthcare professionals (skills, attitudes, opinions, motivation for change or individual characteristics), social context (patients and colleagues), factors related to the system (organization and structure, or economic measures), and aspects related to the CPG itself.</p></div>"/>
