<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in March 2010, nursing homes must further develop their quality improvement program to include both quality assurance and performance improvement (QAPI) elements. The five elements of QAPI are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Element 1: Design and Scope </li>
    <li>Element 2: Governance and Leadership </li>
    <li>Element 3: Feedback, Data Systems and Monitoring </li>
    <li>Element 4: Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs) </li>
    <li>Element 5: Systematic Analysis and Systematic Action </li>
</ul>
<p>Further discussion of each QAPI element is integrated into the protocol.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Steps to Implement Quality Improvement</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Determine QAPI Element 1: Design and Scope.
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The QAPI program must be ongoing and comprehensive. Its purpose is safety with high quality clinical interventions together with autonomy and choice in the residents' daily lives. The QAPI program is based on the best available evidence.</p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Develop a quality philosophy based on the organization's mission statement to provide clear direction (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
        <li>Develop a written QAPI plan that includes clinical care, quality of life, resident choice, and care transitions involving all services and departments. </li>
        <li>Determine standards of care to be followed for care given in the facility.
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use of standardized procedures and audits within nursing homes are feasible and associated with higher-quality of care (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Determine guidelines for quality management.
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Guidelines need to include leadership involvement, customer input, teamwork, and a focus on outcomes and effectiveness of care (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Place residents and family at the center of the QAPI plan because quality improvement should be resident and family focused (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine quality improvement program framework (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>).
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA) identifies the quality committee as the Quality Assurance and Assessment (QAA) Committee. </li>
        <li>All committees should report to the QAA Committee, including Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, Infection Control Committee, Ethics Committee, Safety Committee, and any other facility specific committees (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
        <li>Department quality committees should report to the QAA Committee (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
        <li>Determine reporting mechanism to the board of directors (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
        <li>Establish key quality measures (QMs) that are routinely monitored across the organization (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
        <li>Establish key departmental QMs that are routinely monitored across each department, some of which are compiled as part of the organization-wide QMs (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Determine QAA Committee structure.
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Chair and committee membership need to be determined.
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: OBRA requires membership to include the Director of Nursing, a physician designated by the facility, and at least three other members of the facility staff. Other members can be determined by facility needs, although every department needs to be represented and at least two direct care staff members (e.g., Certified Nurse Assistant [CNA], housekeeper, laundry assistant, maintenance man) need to be on the committee.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Each department head is accountable for quality in his/her own department. The Administrator is ultimately accountable for quality in the facility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>A meeting schedule needs to be established. </li>
        <li>Determine committee process, including meeting format and agenda setting (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Implement teamwork concepts, since positive outcomes are more likely with team initiatives (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>).
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Stages of teamwork include:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Forming &amp;ndash; The first stage of group development involves reducing ambiguity and determining acceptable behaviors. </li>
            <li>Storming &amp;ndash; During this second stage of development, there is intergroup conflict. The goal during &quot;storming&quot; is resolving conflict and focusing on the assigned task. </li>
            <li>Norming &amp;ndash; The third stage involves acceptance of the group members and creation of new boundaries for group behaviors. Group cohesion develops during this stage. </li>
            <li>Performing &amp;ndash; The fourth stage is characterized by mutual problem solving to meet the goals of the group (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
            <li>Adjourning &amp;ndash; The fifth stage is characterized by sharing improved processes with others </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Every team/staff member is important (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). Individual team members can benefit from team participation as shown by:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Continued learning </li>
            <li>Acquisition of specialized knowledge and skills </li>
            <li>Impact of new knowledge on job performance (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>) </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Staff members who have direct knowledge of the problem and who are directly impacted by the project are particularly helpful members (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Develop a relationship with a gerontological advanced practice nurse for clinical consultation (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>).
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Resident outcomes in nursing homes receiving intensive support from an advanced practice nurse show significant improvement, while homes only receiving quality data without consultation do not show significant improvement in resident outcomes (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
        <li>Residents in nursing homes in which care is planned by advanced practice nurses using evidence-based protocols show better outcomes than nursing homes without advanced practice nurses (e.g., Clinical Nurse Specialist, Nurse Practitioner) (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
        <li>Tips for working with a consultant include:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Identify problems </li>
            <li>Specify specific goals </li>
            <li>Share workplace problems </li>
            <li>Avoid time wasting situations, e.g., socialization, orientation </li>
            <li>Involve the consultant in meetings </li>
            <li>Don't assume that the consultant understands your business </li>
            <li>Ask questions </li>
            <li>Write down ideas and suggestions (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>) </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Implement QAPI Element 2: Governance and Leadership.
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Administration and/or the governing body of the nursing home is to develop and lead the QAPI program. Leadership is to include input from facility staff, residents, and families (or resident representatives).</p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Provide organizational support for the program.
        <p>Management support for the quality improvement program needs to be highly visible (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). The governing body is to work with leadership to set priorities and expectations for safety, quality, rights, choice, and respect through a balance of a culture of safety and a resident-centered culture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Leadership's responsibilities for a quality improvement program include:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Provision of structure
            <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This includes the designation of a person accountable for QAPI</p>
            </li>
            <li>Provision of resources and resource analysis </li>
            <li>Data utilization </li>
            <li>Staff activity and productivity monitoring </li>
            <li>Provision of funding for the program (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>) </li>
            <li>Leadership and facility-wide training on QAPI </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Management needs to support changes implemented through the program (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>). </li>
        <li>Lack of administrative support limits or prevents success in a quality improvement program (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Implement an educational program for all nursing home staff (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>).
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: QAPI education is required for all nursing home staff, including leadership.</p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>An initial overview session needs to be developed to include:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Definitions of quality, the program's purpose, and implementation dates </li>
            <li>Rationales for development of a quality improvement program </li>
            <li>Expectations for all staff to be involved </li>
            <li>Specific tasks for staff involvement (<strong>Evidence grade = C1</strong>) </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The initial overview session needs to be incorporated into orientation for all new staff members. </li>
        <li>Educational sessions for committee members with additional information regarding data collection and management, data analysis, improvement plans, committee functioning (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>), and change leadership (<strong>Evidence grade = D</strong>). </li>

    <li>Nursing home quality is influenced by federal and state regulators with the history of nursing home quality woven throughout federal and state programs. Quality improvement processes are mandated by law and are used as a means to improve quality of care in nursing homes. Legally, nursing homes are required to use the research-based Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) for assessment and care planning purposes. Quality measures have been developed based on the RAI assessment data. Since nursing homes are required to use these instruments, this administrative guideline is built on these requirements. Individuals using this administrative guideline need to acquaint themselves with the RAI, the most recent version of the <em>MDS 3.0 User's Manual</em>, which details use of the RAI, and the Five Elements of Quality Assurance and Program Improvement (QAPI). </li>
    <li>Nursing homes with clinical consultation from advanced practice nurses show significantly higher levels of quality than nursing homes without clinical consultants. This administrative guideline is based on the premise that nursing homes use or will use a clinical consultant to enhance their quality of care and their quality improvement program. Advanced practice nurses are increasingly present as members of the nursing home workforce. Research has shown that a relationship exists between advanced practice nurses and improved quality of care in nursing homes. Improving quality of care in nursing homes has improved resident outcomes when using advanced practice nurses either on-site or in consultation where they could effect change in clinical practice. Another way to increase quality improvement would be to develop partnerships with schools of nursing within an academic health center. These academic partnerships have given extra support and assistance to the facilities to help them in providing more education and expert resources. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evaluation of Administrative Guideline Implementation Process and Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Throughout the original guideline document, the terms process and outcome have been used to refer to indicators for the evaluation of quality of resident care. In this section, these terms will be used to evaluate the implementation process and outcomes of the implementation of this administrative guideline. In the overview, reference was made to the fact that not all quality improvement programs succeed. The purpose of this section is to guide the facility in evaluating the implementation and outcomes of a nursing home Quality Improvement Program, using this administrative guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Process Indicators</strong></p>
<p>Process indicators are those interpersonal and environmental factors that can facilitate the use of an administrative guideline. Process quality indicators (QIs) may help to improve quality of care.</p>
<p>One process factor that can be assessed with a sample of professional and nonprofessional staff is knowledge about Quality Improvement. The Quality Improvement Knowledge Assessment tests should be assessed before and following the education of staff regarding use of this administrative guideline. Two forms of the test are available. One form is for professional and nonprofessional staff, who will be involved in data collection, management, analysis, and decision making. The other form is for all staff members who are involved with the program, but do not have responsibility for the data and decision making.</p>
<p>The same sample of professional and nonprofessional staff with data and decision making responsibilities should also be given the Process Evaluation Monitor after the first quarter of data analysis using the administrative guideline. The purpose of this monitor is to determine staff understanding of the administrative guideline and to assess the support for carrying out the administrative guideline. Items for the administrative guideline were adapted from the standardized Gerontological Nursing Interventions Research Center (GNIRC) protocol format and a previous study of nurses' involvement on quality improvement teams.</p>
<p>A facility-wide process indicator that should be monitored over time is:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Continued use of a gerontological nurse consultant either on-site or by telephone. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome Indicators</strong></p>
<p>Outcome indicators are those expected to change or improve from consistent use of this administrative guideline in nursing home quality improvement programs. QIs are more stringent indicators because appropriate care should reflect resident health outcomes. The core quality measures (QMs) that should be monitored over time are the CMS-required QMs plus the QIs determined by each department.</p>
<p>The Quality Improvement Outcomes monitor is to be used for monitoring and evaluating the usefulness of the Quality Improvement administrative guideline in improving nursing home residents' outcomes. Please adapt this outcome monitor to your facility and add outcomes you believe are important.</p></div>"/>
