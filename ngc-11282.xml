	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The strength of therapeutic recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Optional</strong>) is defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Genetic Test Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cytochrome P450 2C9 (<em>CYP2C9</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Clinical laboratories typically report <em>CYP2C9</em> genotype results using the star (*) allele nomenclature system and an interpretation that includes a predicted metabolizer phenotype (<em>CYP2C9</em> allele definition table [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Most U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved <em>CYP2C9</em> tests include only <em>*2</em> and <em>*3</em>, which is not as informative for African ancestry populations; however, some clinical laboratories may offer expanded <em>CYP2C9</em> panels validated as laboratory developed tests (LDTs) (for allele frequencies, see <em>CYP2C9</em> frequency table [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). </p>
<p><strong>Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase Complex Subunit 1 (<em>VKORC1</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Clinical laboratories typically report <em>VKORC1</em> genotype results by c.-1639G&amp;gt;A (or the linked 1173C&amp;gt;T; rs9934438) genotype (e.g., G/A) and an interpretation on warfarin sensitivity (<em>VKORC1</em> allele definition table [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Most commercial genotyping platforms do not detect rare <em>VKORC1</em> variants that have been associated with warfarin resistance (<em>VKORC1</em> frequency table [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). </p>
<p><strong>Cytochrome P450 4F2 (<em>CYP4F2</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Although not as commonly tested for as <em>CYP2C9</em> and <em>VKORC1</em>, some clinical laboratories may also test for <em>CYP4F2</em> using a targeted genotyping laboratory developed test to detect <em>CYP4F2*3</em> (c.1297G&amp;gt;A, p.Val433Met; rs2108622) variant (<em>CYP4F2</em> allele definition table [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Results are typically reported by nucleotide (e.g., G/A), amino acid (e.g., Val/Met) or star (*) allele (<em>*1/*3</em>) genotype and an interpretation related to warfarin dosing. </p>
<p><strong>CYP2C rs12777823</strong></p>
<p>Given the recent identification of the association between rs12777823 (g.96405502G&amp;gt;A) and warfarin dosing among African Americans, most clinical laboratories do not currently include this non-coding variant in their warfarin pharmacogenetic genotyping panels. However, the increasing accessibility of clinical research genomics programs that return actionable results and the notable effect of this variant among African Americans suggests that some patients may have genotype results for this variant in the future. Results would likely be reported by genotype (e.g., G/A) and an interpretation related to warfarin dosing.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Genetic Test Options</span></strong></p>
<p>Commercially available genetic testing options change over time. Additional information about pharmacogenetic testing can be found at the Genetic Testing Registry (<a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&quot; title=&quot;Genetic Testing Registry (GTR®)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/</a>). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Incidental Findings</span></strong></p>
<p>No diseases have been linked to common <em>CYP2C9</em> variants independent of drug metabolism and response. Similarly, no diseases have been consistently linked to common <em>VKORC1</em> and <em>CYP4F2</em> variants that are interrogated in warfarin response tests. However, homozygosity for rare coding mutations in <em>VKORC1</em> are a known cause of combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors-2 (VKCFD2), which is a rare and potentially fatal bleeding disorder that can be reversed by oral administration of vitamin K.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Therapeutic Recommendations: Adults</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Warfarin Maintenance (Chronic) Dosage Based on Genetic Information</strong></p>
<p>The authors use the three-tiered rating system, described in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field, in which ratings of strong, moderate, and optional are applied based on the evidence reviewed. The recommendations for dosing based on genotype contained herein include recommendations and are derived from numerous observational and prospective studies, and randomized trials that suggest the ability to more accurately identify stable therapeutic warfarin dose requirements through the use of both genetic and clinical information. Data from prospective studies and randomized controlled trials are equivocal on whether the improvement in dosing prediction by pharmacogenetics dosing leads to improved clinical outcomes. The majority of the literature underpinning these guidelines arises from individuals of European ancestry, African Americans, and East Asians. However, the more limited literature in other populations generally suggests the guidelines are appropriate in them also. </p>
<p>Numerous studies have derived warfarin dosing algorithms that use both genetic and nongenetic factors to predict warfarin dose. Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose and were created using more than 5,000 subjects, although as noted above, more recent data suggest they do not perform acceptably in African Americans when used without modification for <em>CYP2C9</em> alleles frequently found in the African population. The Gage and International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) algorithms or minor adjustments to them have also been the algorithms used in both randomized controlled trials and most of the prospective dosing studies. Dosing algorithms using genetic information outperform nongenetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction, except in African Americans when the algorithm only includes <em>CYP2C9*2</em> and <em>*3</em>. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacogenetic Algorithm-based Warfarin Dosing</strong></p>
<p>This guideline recommends that pharmacogenetic warfarin dosing be accomplished through the use of one of the pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms described above, as summarized in Figure 2 in the original guideline document. These algorithms, as originally published, are available in the Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations. The clinical and genetic information used in one or both algorithms is shown in Text Box 1 in the original guideline document. These algorithms compute the anticipated stable daily warfarin dose to one decimal and the clinician must then prescribe a regimen (e.g., an estimate of 4.3 mg/day might be given as 4 mg daily except 5 mg 2 days per week). An additional &quot;dose revision&quot; algorithm, which can be used on days 4&amp;ndash;5 of therapy for dose refinement and uses genetic information, was tested in the COAG and EU-PACT trials and can also be used (Supplemental Table S5). </p>
<p>It is important to note that these algorithms do not include <em>CYP4F2</em>, <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, <em>*6</em>, <em>*8</em>, or <em>*11</em> or rs12777823, and incorporation of these should be added when results are available, as described in Figure 2. The <a href=&quot;http://www.warfarindosing.org/Source/Home.aspx&quot; title=&quot;WarfarinDosing.org Web site&quot;>WarfarinDosing.org</a> contains both algorithms, the Gage algorithm as the primary algorithm and the IWPC algorithm as the secondary algorithm and can adjust for <em>CYP4F2</em>, <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, and <em>*6</em>. If utilizing <a href=&quot;http://www.warfarindosing.org/Source/Home.aspx&quot; title=&quot;WarfarinDosing.org Web site&quot;>WarfarinDosing.org</a>, the user should be clear on whether the algorithm is or is not incorporating genotypes beyond <em>CYP2C9 *2</em> and <em>*3</em> and <em>VKORC1</em>, which are the only three genotypes in the original version of both algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacogenetics-informed Loading (or Initiation) Dose Calculation</strong></p>
<p>The use of a different initial warfarin dose (or &quot;loading dose&quot;) is somewhat controversial and plays different roles in different regions of the world, based on experience and local standards. Recent data from a diverse U.S.-based cohort suggest that failure to provide a loading dose in patients with zero or one variant alleles in <em>VKORC1</em> or <em>CYP2C9</em> may delay time to therapeutic INR and reduce time in therapeutic range in the initial month of therapy. A genetically guided loading dose approach was developed by Avery et al. and a slightly modified version was successfully implemented in the EU-PACT trial. In COAG <em>CYP2C9</em> variant alleles were not considered for the initial dose, providing a small loading dose on day 1. Whether differences in loading dose strategies between the EU-PACT and COAG trials contributed to differing results is not known. If loading doses are to be used, a genetically informed approach to calculating the loading dose may be helpful. The majority of the experience with a genetically informed loading regimen is in those of European ancestry. Determination of maintenance dose would be as described above. </p>
<p><strong>Non-African Ancestry Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>In patients who self-identify as non-African ancestry, the recommendation, as summarized in Figure 2, is to: 1) calculate warfarin dosing using a published pharmacogenetic algorithm, including genotype information for <em>VKORC1-1639G&amp;gt;A</em> and <em>CYP2C9*2</em> and <em>*3</em>. In individuals with genotypes associated with CYP2C9 poor metabolism (e.g., <em>CYP2C9 *2/*3, *3/*3</em>) or both increased sensitivity (<em>VKORC1-1639</em> A/A) and CYP2C9 poor metabolism, an alternative oral anticoagulant might be considered. The bulk of the literature informing these recommendations is in European and Asian ancestry populations, but consistent data exist for other non-African populations. These recommendations are graded as <strong>STRONG</strong>. 2) If a loading dose is to be utilized, the EU-PACT loading dose algorithm that incorporates genetic information could be used. This recommendation is <strong>OPTIONAL</strong>. 3) While <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, <em>*6</em>, <em>*8</em>, or <em>*11</em> variant alleles are commonly referred to as African-specific alleles, they can occur among individuals who do not identify as, or know of their, African ancestry. If these variant alleles are detected, decrease calculated dose by 15% to 30% per variant allele or consider an alternative agent. Larger dose reductions might be needed in patients homozygous for variant alleles (i.e., 20% to 40%, e.g., <em>CYP2C9*2/*5</em>). This recommendation is graded as <strong>OPTIONAL</strong>. 4) If the <em>CYP4F2*3</em> (i.e., c.1297A, p.433Met) allele is also detected, increase the dose by 5% to 10%. This recommendation is also considered <strong>OPTIONAL</strong>. 5) The data do not suggest an association between rs12777823 genotype and warfarin dose in non-African Americans, thus rs12777823 should not be considered in these individuals (even if available). </p>
<p><strong>African Ancestry Recommendation</strong> </p>
<p>In patients of African ancestry, <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, <em>*6</em>, <em>*8</em>, <em>*11</em> are important for warfarin dosing. If these genotypes are not available, warfarin should be dosed clinically without consideration for genotype. If <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, <em>*6</em>, <em>*8</em>, and <em>*11</em> are known, then the recommendation, as shown in Figure 2, is to: 1) calculate warfarin dose using a validated pharmacogenetic algorithm, including genotype information for <em>VKORC1 c.-1639G&amp;gt;A</em> and <em>CYP2C9*2</em> and <em>*3</em>; 2) if the individual carries a <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, <em>*6</em>, <em>*8</em>, or <em>*11</em> variant allele(s), decrease calculated dose by 15% to 30%. Larger dose reductions might be needed in patients who carry two variant alleles (e.g., <em>CYP2C9*5/*6</em>) (i.e., 20% to 40% dose reduction). 3) In addition, rs12777823 is associated with warfarin dosing in African Americans (mainly originating from West Africa). Thus, in African Americans a dose reductions of 10% to 25% in those with rs12777823 A/G or A/A genotype is recommended. These recommendations are considered <strong>MODERATE</strong>. </p>
<p>In individuals with genotypes that predict CYP2C9 poor metabolism or who have increased warfarin sensitivity (<em>VKORC1</em> c.-1639 A/A) and CYP2C9 poor metabolism, an alternative oral anticoagulant should be considered, for non-African ancestry. As noted above, if a loading dose is to be used, the EU-PACT algorithm that incorporates genetic information could be used to calculate loading dose. This recommendation is <strong>OPTIONAL</strong>. The data do not support an impact on clinical phenotype for <em>CYP4F2</em> on warfarin dosing in those of African ancestry and so no recommendation is made for use of <em>CYP4F2</em> genotype data in blacks.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations for Pediatric Patients</span></strong></p>
<p>As detailed in Supplemental Table S7, there is strong evidence for the use of <em>CYP2C9*2</em> and <em>*3</em> and <em>VKORC1-1639G&amp;gt;A</em> genotype to guide warfarin dosing in children of European ancestry. The studies in Japanese pediatric individuals are conflicting, as <em>VKORC1</em> and <em>CYP2C9</em> could not be adequately evaluated due to the low numbers of <em>CYP2C9</em> variant carriers. For other ethnicities, there is no evidence documenting that <em>VKORC1</em> and <em>CYP2C9</em> are important. Furthermore, there are no data in children that included <em>CYP2C9*5</em>, <em>*6</em>, <em>*8</em>, or <em>*11</em> genotyping. Based on the current evidence, in children of European ancestry and if <em>CYP2C9*2</em> and <em>*3</em> and <em>VKORC1-1639</em> genotype are available, calculate warfarin dosing based on a validated published pediatric pharmacogenetic algorithm (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document). A dosing tool that can be used in children of European ancestry is available at <a href=&quot;http://www.warfarindoserevision.com&quot; title=&quot;Warfarin Dose Revision Web site&quot;>http://www.warfarindoserevision.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other Considerations</span></strong> </p>
<p>Given the effects of CYP2C9 on warfarin clearance, and given that the <em>CYP2C9</em> variant alleles are associated with reduced warfarin clearance, <em>CYP2C9</em> genotype may influence time to onset and offset of anticoagulation, as measured by INR. The Supplemental Material summarizes other considerations in the dosing of warfarin, including clinical factors and interacting drugs, some of which are included in the pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms (see Text Box 1 in the original guideline document). Other genes of potential importance are detailed in the Supplemental Material and Supplemental Table S6, including <em>CALU</em> and <em>GGCX</em>. Most clinical genotyping platforms do not include these genes, nor do the dosing tables or published algorithms. The Supplemental Material also discusses incorporation of genetic information into the initial dose, and alternatives to warfarin.</p>

<p>The authors searched the PubMed&amp;reg; database (January 1966 to August 2016) for the following keywords: ((cytochrome P450 2C9 or CYP2C9) OR (VKORC1) OR (cytochrome P450 4F2 or CYP4F2) AND (warfarin) AND English [Language]). Using these search terms, 1221 publications were identified. In addition, studies annotated in PharmGKB (<a href=&quot;http://www.pharmgkb.org&quot; title=&quot;PharmGKB Web site&quot;>http://www.pharmgkb.org</a>) were identified. Study inclusion criteria included publications that included analyses for the association between <em>CYP2C9/VKORC1/CYP4F</em>2 genotypes and metabolism of warfarin or warfarin-related adverse drug events or clinical outcomes. Non-English manuscripts were excluded.</p>
<p>The <em>CYP2C9/VKORC1/CYP4F2</em> frequency tables (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) were made by searching the PubMed&amp;reg; database (1995 to 2016). The following criteria were used for <em>CYP2C9</em>: (CYP2C9 or 2C9 or cytochrome P4502C9) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity OR population) with filter limits set to retrieve &quot;full-text&quot; and &quot;English&quot; literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the <em>CYP2C9</em> frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses). Similar search strategies were used for <em>VKORC1</em> and <em>CYP4F2</em> genes. Allele frequencies reported in phase 3 1000 Genomes were also included (<a href=&quot;http://phase3browser.1000genomes.org/index.html&quot; title=&quot;1000 Genomes Web site&quot;>http://phase3browser.1000genomes.org/index.html</a>).</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summarization and Presentation of the Evidence Linking Genotype to Drug Variability</span></strong></p>
<p>Publications supporting a major finding are usually considered as a group and scored by members of the writing committee based on the totality of the evidence supporting that major finding.

The rating scheme (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field) uses a scale modified slightly from Valdes et al. Primary publications are summarized in the Evidence Table which is published in the manuscript supplemental material (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). It is the writing committee's evaluation of this evidence that provides the basis for the therapeutic recommendation(s). </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Identification of Content Experts and Formation of Writing Committee</span></strong></p>
<p>Once a guideline topic has been approved by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) members and the Steering Committee, a senior author is identified through self-nomination or by request of the CPIC Steering Committee. The senior author takes responsibility for forming the writing committee and completing the guideline. The writing committee is multidisciplinary, comprising a variety of scientists, pharmacologists, and clinicians (e.g., pharmacists and physicians). Authors will have a track record of publication and/or expertise in the specific topic area of the guideline. PharmGKB assigns at least one Scientific Curator to each CPIC guideline writing committee who has expertise in searching, compiling and evaluating the evidence for gene-drug associations, and making it computable and available on the PharmGKB Web site. Furthermore, PharmGKB curators often take primary responsibility for completing background gene and drug summaries, assigning likely phenotypes based on genotypes (i.e., &quot;Table 1&quot; in guidelines), literature review, as well as preparing supplementary material provided in each guideline (i.e., genotypes that constitute the star (*) alleles or haplotypes, frequencies of alleles in major race/ethnic groups, genetic test interpretation and availability, and evidence linking genotype with phenotype).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Therapeutic Recommendation and Assignment of Strength of the Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>The writing committee discusses the evaluation of the literature and develops a draft recommendation via Web conferences and email communication. CPIC's therapeutic recommendations are based on weighing the evidence summarized in the supplementary Evidence Table from a combination of preclinical functional and clinical data, as well as on any existing consensus guidelines. Evidence related to the suitability of alternative medications or dosing that may be used based on genetics must be weighed in assigning the strength of the recommendation. Overall, the therapeutic recommendations are simplified to allow rapid interpretation by clinicians and are presented in the Table 2 of each guideline and occasionally in an algorithm. </p>
<p>To assign strength to a recommendation, CPIC uses a transparent three category system (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field) for rating recommendations that was adopted with slight modification from the rating scale for evidence-based recommendations on the use of antiretroviral agents (<a href=&quot;http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AIDSinfo Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf</a>). Each recommendation also includes an assessment of its usefulness in pediatric patients. </p>
<p>CPIC guidelines currently focus on gene-drug pairs for which at least one of the prescribing recommendations is actionable (e.g., recommendation to alter a dose or consider an alternative drug based on the genotype-phenotype relationship). For these and many other gene-drug pairs, PharmGKB also contains clinical annotations that are genotype-based summaries of the association between a drug and a particular variant. Each clinical annotation is assigned a level of evidence depending on population, replication, effect size and statistical significance.</p>

<p>Once the writing committee has completed and approved a draft guideline, the draft guideline is circulated to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) co-leaders and coordinator for content review. The guideline is reviewed for compliance with the CPIC Standard Operating Procedures and required format. The guideline draft is then discussed on a CPIC conference call with all CPIC members and circulated to the members for further review and approval. At each stage, feedback is considered for incorporation into the guideline and/or revision of the guideline, as supported by the available evidence and expert clinical judgment of the senior author and writing committee. Finally, the guideline manuscript undergoes typical external scientific peer review by the journal prior to publication. Current agreements with the American Society for <em>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</em> give the journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics the first right of refusal for publication of CPIC guidelines; as part of this agreement, the guidelines are freely posted to PharmGKB immediately upon publication. In general <em>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</em> uses a minimum of two external expert peer-reviewers and an editorial board member with content expertise as reviewers for each CPIC guideline.</p></div>"/>

Genetic-guided dosing may increase the risk for overdosing or underdosing, especially in individuals who carry rare or untested variants and are assigned as &quot;wild-type&quot; by default. Although there is substantial evidence associating <em>CYP2C9</em> and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (<em>VKORC1</em>) variants with warfarin dosing, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated inconsistent results in terms of clinical outcomes (see &quot;Linking genetic variability to variability in drug-related phenotypes&quot; in the original guideline document). Although genotyping is reliable when performed in qualified laboratories, an additional risk is an error in genotyping or reporting of genotype. Genotypes are life-long test results, so such error could have long-term adverse health implications.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>Many pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms are developed for a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2&amp;ndash;3 and so their utility for estimating therapeutic warfarin doses with other target INR ranges is uncertain; however, some algorithms accommodate the target INR explicitly. Pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing does not alter the requirements for regular INR monitoring. There are patients for whom genetic testing is likely to be of little or no benefit, including those who already have had long-term treatment with stable warfarin doses and those who are unable to achieve stable dosing due to variable adherence. The greatest potential benefit is early in the course of therapy (before therapy initiation or in the early days of therapy). It is likely that patients on therapy for many weeks to months, with careful INR monitoring, will derive little benefit from subsequent warfarin pharmacogenetics testing.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Disclaimer</span></strong> </p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision-making and to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for a patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made solely by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Underlying Assumption</span></strong> </p>
<p>The key underlying assumption for all CPIC guidelines is that clinical high-throughput and pre-emptive genotyping will eventually become common practice and clinicians will increasingly have patients' genotypes available before a prescription is written. Therefore, CPIC guidelines are designed to provide guidance to clinicians as to how available genetic test results should be interpreted to ultimately improve drug therapy, rather than to provide guidance as to whether a genetic test should or should not be ordered.</p></div>"/>
