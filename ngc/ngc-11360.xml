	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based, Formal consensus, Informal consensus, No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How should platelets for transfusion be prepared?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em>. Platelets for transfusion can be prepared either by separation of units of platelet concentrates (PCs) from whole blood using either the buffy coat (BC) or the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) method, which can be pooled before administration, or by apheresis from single donors. Comparative studies have shown that the post-transfusion increments, hemostatic benefit, and adverse effects are similar with any of these platelet products. Thus, in routine circumstances, they can be used interchangeably. In most centers, pooled PCs are less costly. Single-donor platelets from selected donors are necessary when histocompatible platelet transfusions are needed (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In what circumstances should providers take steps to prevent Rhesus (Rh) alloimmunization resulting from platelet transfusion?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2</em>. Prevention of RhD alloimmunization resulting from platelet transfusions to RhD-negative recipients can be achieved either through the exclusive use of platelet products collected from RhD-negative donors or via anti-D immunoprophylaxis. These approaches may be used for female children and female adults of child-bearing potential being treated with curative intent. However, because of the low rate of RhD alloimmunization in patients with cancer, these approaches need not be applied universally (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In what circumstances should providers use leukoreduced blood products to prevent alloimmunization?</strong> </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3</em>. The incidence of alloantibody-mediated refractoriness to platelet transfusion can be decreased in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving induction chemotherapy when both platelet and red blood cell (RBC) products are leukoreduced before transfusion. It is therefore appropriate to provide leukoreduced blood products to patients with AML from the time of diagnosis to ameliorate this important clinical problem. Although randomized trials have not been conducted in other patient groups, it is likely that alloimmunization can also be decreased in patients with other types of leukemia and in other patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy. There are fewer data in patients who are not receiving chemotherapy in the same time periods that the transfusions are being administered (e.g., aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia), although the consensus would favor its use in these patients as well. In the United States and in several other countries, the overwhelming majority of blood products are now leukoreduced at the time of blood collection and component preparation. Other advantages of prestorage leukoreduction include a substantial reduction in transfusion reactions and in transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should platelet transfusions be given prophylactically or therapeutically? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em>. Prophylactic platelet transfusion should be administered to patients with thrombocytopenia resulting from impaired bone marrow function to reduce the risk of hemorrhage when the platelet count falls below a predefined threshold level. This threshold level for transfusion varies according to the patient's diagnosis, clinical condition, and treatment modality (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with hematologic malignancies?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5</em>. The Panel recommends a threshold of &amp;lt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L for prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients receiving therapy for hematologic malignancies. Transfusion at higher levels may be advisable in patients with signs of hemorrhage, high fever, hyperleukocytosis, rapid fall of platelet count, or coagulation abnormalities (e.g., acute promyelocytic leukemia) and in those undergoing invasive procedures or in circumstances in which platelet transfusions may not be readily available in case of emergencies, as might be the case for outpatients who live at a distance from the treatment center (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6</em>. The Panel recommends a threshold of &amp;lt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L for prophylactic platelet transfusion in adult and pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Prophylactic platelet transfusion may be administered at higher counts based on clinician judgment. In adult recipients of autologous HSCT, randomized trials have demonstrated similar rates of bleeding with decreased platelet usage when patients are transfused at the first sign of bleeding rather than prophylactically, and this approach may be used in experienced centers. This recommendation is not generalizable to pediatric patients (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there a role for prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with chronic, stable, severe thrombocytopenia who are not receiving active treatment?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em>. Patients with chronic, stable, severe thrombocytopenia, such as individuals with myelodysplasia or aplastic anemia, who are not receiving active treatment may be observed without prophylactic transfusion, reserving platelet transfusions for episodes of hemorrhage or during times of active treatment (Type of recommendation: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with solid tumors?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8</em>. The risk of bleeding in patients with solid tumors during chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is related to the depth and duration of the platelet nadir, although other factors contribute as well. The Panel recommends a threshold of &amp;lt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L for prophylactic platelet transfusion, based on extrapolation from studies in hematologic malignancies. Platelet transfusion at higher levels is appropriate in patients with active localized bleeding which can sometimes be seen in patients with necrotic tumors (Type of recommendation: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>At what platelet count can surgical or invasive procedures be performed?</strong></p>
<p>Recommendation 9. The Panel recommends a threshold of 40 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 5 x 100<sup>9</sup>/L for performing major invasive procedures in the absence of associated coagulation abnormalities. Certain procedures, such as bone marrow aspirations and biopsies, and insertion or removal of central venous catheters, can be performed safely at counts &amp;ge;20 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. There are sparse data, and no randomized trials, addressing the safety of other invasive procedures at much lower count levels. If platelet transfusions are administered before a procedure, it is critical that a posttransfusion platelet count be obtained to prove that the desired platelet count level has been reached. Platelet transfusions should also be available on short notice, in case intraoperative or postoperative bleeding occurs. For alloimmunized patients, histocompatible platelets must be available in these circumstances (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 10</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>When and how should patients be monitored for refractoriness to platelet transfusion?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 10</em>. Although there are no empirical data to suggest that monitoring and acting on the post&amp;ndash;platelet-transfusion count decreases the incidence of hemorrhagic events, the Panel consensus is that platelet counts performed 10 to 60 minutes after transfusion should be obtained after all transfusions, when refractoriness is suspected. Because patients may have a poor increment to a single transfusion, yet have excellent platelet increments with subsequent transfusions, a diagnosis of refractoriness to platelet transfusion should be made only when at least two transfusions of ABO-compatible units, stored for &amp;lt;72 hours, result in poor increments, as defined in the supporting text of the recommendation (Type of recommendation: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 11</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How should refractoriness to platelet transfusion be managed?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 11</em>. Alloimmunization is usually due to antibody against human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and only rarely to platelet-specific antigens. Patients with alloimmune-refractory thrombocytopenia, as defined previously, are best managed with platelet transfusions from histocompatible donors matched for HLA-A and HLA-B antigens. Many blood suppliers have access to computerized lists of such donors. For patients (1) whose HLA type cannot be determined, (2) who have uncommon HLA types for whom suitable donors cannot be identified, or (3) who do not respond to HLA-matched platelets, histocompatible platelet donors can often be identified using platelet cross-matching techniques. In many patients, these two techniques are complementary (Type of recommendations: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>

<p>Two 2015 systematic review-based guidelines by the AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG) formed the starting point for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The AABB search included publications from 1946 to the first week of September 2014, and the ICTMG search included publications from 1946 to December 2013. For clinical questions that were addressed by either the AABB or the ICTMG, the ASCO search included publications from January 1, 2014, through October 26, 2016, using both PubMed and the Cochrane Library. For clinical questions not addressed by the AABB and the ICTMG (leukoreduction; patients with chronic, stable, severe thrombocytopenia; and patients with solid tumors) or that were partially addressed (invasive procedures), the ASCO search included publications from January 1, 2000, through October 26, 2016. The updated search was guided by the signals approach, which is designed to identify only new, potentially practice-changing data&amp;mdash;signals&amp;mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provides additional information about the signals approach.</p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Population: adults and children (&amp;ge;4 months of age) with hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, or hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia </li>
    <li>Intervention: prophylactic or therapeutic platelet transfusion </li>
    <li>Outcomes: bleeding, alloimmunization, platelet refractoriness </li>
    <li>Publication types: clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; or (3) published in a non-English language. </p>
