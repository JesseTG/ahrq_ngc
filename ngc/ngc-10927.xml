	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that unexplained chronic cough be defined as a cough that persists longer than 8 weeks, and remains unexplained after investigation, and supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that patients with chronic cough undergo a guideline/protocol based assessment process that includes objective testing for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic bronchitis, or a therapeutic corticosteroid trial (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests a therapeutic trial of multimodality speech pathology therapy (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia (sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide), the Expert Panel suggests that inhaled corticosteroids not be prescribed (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests a therapeutic trial of gabapentin as long as the potential side effects and the risk-benefit profile are discussed with patients before use of the medication, and there is a reassessment of the risk-benefit profile at 6 months before continuing the drug (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Because health-related quality of life of some patients can be so adversely impacted by their unexplained chronic cough, and because gabapentin has been associated with improvement in quality of life in a randomized controlled clinical trial, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Cough Expert Panel believes that the potential benefits in some patients outweigh the potential side effects. With respect to dosing, patients without contraindications to gabapentin can be prescribed a dose escalation schedule beginning at 300 mg once a day with additional doses being added each day as tolerated up to a maximum tolerable daily dose of 1,800 mg a day in two divided doses.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and a negative workup for acid gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Expert Panel suggests that proton pump inhibitor therapy not be prescribed (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>

Systematic reviews and clinical trials were identified from searches of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Cochrane Library]) commencing from the earliest available date until April 2014. The reference lists of retrieved articles were examined for additional citations. The search terms used were: [Cough OR chronic cough] AND [Idiopathic OR refractory OR unexplained OR intractable]. An additional search for chronic cough and [clinical trial] was conducted in PubMed.</p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of the search results were independently evaluated by two reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles, based on the eligibility criteria of the study design (randomized controlled trial [RCT], controlled clinical trial, or systematic review) and population (patients with chronic cough that was unexplained, refractory to treatment, or idiopathic; in adults or adolescents aged &amp;gt;12 years) (see Table 1 in the original guideline document).

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The methodology of the CHEST Guideline Oversight Committee was used to select the Expert Cough Panel chair and the international panel of experts to perform the systematic review, synthesis of the evidence, and development of the recommendations and suggestions (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for methodology documents).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the quality of the evidence, the recommendation grading includes a strength of recommendation dimension, which is used for all CHEST guidelines. In the context of practice recommendations, a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies only to some patients. In the context of research recommendations (e.g., those provided in the present guideline), the Expert Panel intended for a strong recommendation (Grade 1) to imply that the Expert Panel recommends using intervention fidelity strategies in all studies in which patients with chronic cough are being diagnosed and managed. Intervention fidelity has been identified as an important aspect of chronic cough studies and is defined &quot;as the extent to which an intervention was delivered as conceived and planned-to arrive at valid conclusions concerning its effectiveness in achieving target outcomes.&quot; The strength of recommendation here is based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations. Harms incorporate risks and burdens to the patients, which can include convenience or lack of convenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness. These variables, in turn, affect patient preferences. The resource considerations extend beyond economics and should also factor in time and other indirect costs. The authors of these recommendations have considered these parameters in determining the strength of the recommendations and associated grades.</p>
<p>The findings of this systematic review were used to support the evidence-graded recommendations or suggestions. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. The total number of eligible voters for each guidance statement varied based on the number of managed individuals recused from voting on any particular statements because of their potential conflicts of interest (e-Table 1 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Transparency of process was documented. Further details of the methods related to conflicts of interests and transparency have been published in the methodology and CHEST guideline development documents.</p></div>"/>

Press releases were prepared for both the lay and medical media, with major outreach efforts to all relevant print, broadcast, and Internet media. Panelists located in various large media markets were identified as potential spokespersons for interviews. Social media promotion was facilitated over Twitter, Facebook, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) e-Communities, internal and external blogs, and other communication routes. Blast communications were sent to CHEST members with links to the publication and postings on CHEST's Web site.</p>
<p>In addition to publication in <em>CHEST</em>, other derivative products were prepared to help with implementation, including slide sets, algorithms, and other clinical tools. These derivative products are posted on the CHEST Web site and will be made available in CHEST Guidelines. CHEST Guidelines will be the repository for the most current recommendations and suggestions from all CHEST guidelines, consensus statements, and hybrid documents. This online repository will also house a collection of related resources.</p>
