	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Mesenteric vascular insufficiency is a serious medical condition that may lead to bowel infarction, morbidity, and mortality that may approach 50%. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which may be acute and severe or insidious in onset and vague. Postprandial pain is common. On physical examination, patients may exhibit pain out of proportion to physical examination. Causes of mesenteric ischemia may be arterial (e.g., thromboembolism, atherosclerosis, dissection, and vasculitis), mesenteric venous thrombosis, and hypoperfusion (e.g., hypovolemia, shock). The purpose of imaging evaluation is to determine the underlying cause of bowel ischemia, which then helps direct treatment decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Diagnostic Imaging Modalities</strong></p>
<p>Detection of proximal mesenteric arterial occlusive disease is possible with contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and ultrasound (US). Ostial lesions are reliably evaluated with all 3 modalities. Both US and MRA have been directly compared with angiography. Multidetector CT scanners, particularly with sagittal reformatting, are capable of demonstrating the proximal mesenteric vessels very well. CTA relies on administration of iodinated contrast but does not entail the risks of catheter angiography.</p>
<p>In patients with renal insufficiency or a history of severe reaction to iodinated contrast, noncontrast MRA or US of the mesenteric vessel origins is preferred over CTA. Results vary considerably with operator expertise, patient body habitus, and presence of bowel gas, but accuracy in detecting ostial abnormalities has been reported to be &amp;gt;90%. The more peripheral mesenteric vessels are not as well demonstrated with US or CTA, and angiography has remained the best method to evaluate these vessels. Therefore, if clinical suspicion of mesenteric ischemia is high, a negative CTA or US examination should not preclude selective mesenteric angiography, particularly if distal disease is a consideration.</p>
<p>Mesenteric venous occlusion can be adequately assessed by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. In cases where these noninvasive diagnostic modalities do not provide a definitive answer, CT arterial portography may be helpful in delineating mesenteric venous anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Therapeutic Modalities</strong></p>
<p>Treatments for mesenteric ischemia attempt to reverse the underlying cause, with the goal of prevention of bowel infarction. Treatment choice depends on the underlying etiology of ischemia. For patients with mesenteric arterial occlusive disease there has been a shift away from surgical treatment (e.g., embolectomy, endarterectomy, and arterial bypass) towards endovascular approaches including thrombolysis and clot retrieval in cases of acute embolus (if peritoneal signs are absent), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and stent placement for patients with chronic arterial occlusive disease. Acute nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) can be managed by intra-arterial administration of vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin or papaverine, or by high-dose intravenous prostaglandin E1. First-line treatment for venous mesenteric ischemia is systemic anticoagulation.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion by Variant</strong></p>
<p><em>Variants 1 and 2: Acute Occlusive Mesenteric Ischemia</em></p>
<p>Surgery has been the standard of care for acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia over the past decades. Several endovascular techniques have been described in the literature, including aspiration embolectomy and thrombolysis for embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), as well as percutaneous transarterial PTA with or without stent placement (PTA/S) for thrombotic occlusions in patients with underlying atherosclerotic disease. Recent literature suggests that in current practice, endovascular techniques are commonly attempted first, and traditional surgical approaches are resorted to when endovascular treatment fails or is not feasible. Use of endovascular approaches has been associated with a decrease in the amount of bowel resected, lower incidence of concomitant renal or respiratory failure, lower subsequent incidence of short bowel syndrome, and lower mortality. However, if symptoms and signs of bowel infarction are present (peritoneal symptoms, pneumoperitoneum, or intramural air on CT), urgent surgery rather than thrombolysis is advised. The inability to confidently exclude bowel infarction in many patients with mesenteric ischemia has limited the widespread use of thrombolysis. Due to the presence of vasospasm associated with occlusive mesenteric ischemia, catheter-directed vasodilator infusion may also be of benefit in some patients with occlusive mesenteric ischemia, especially prior to more definitive therapy. Treatment of underlying stenotic or occlusive lesions using PTA/S can be achieved at the same setting as diagnosis, sometimes after removal of a thrombotic clot by aspiration or thrombolysis.</p>
<p><em>Variant 3: Acute Nonocclusive Mesenteric Ischemia</em></p>
<p>In a patient with signs and symptoms of acute mesenteric ischemia, narrowing of peripheral mesenteric vessels or a pattern of alternating dilatation and narrowing suggests NOMI. This diagnosis is best made with conventional angiography, which would also enable initiation of catheter-directed vasodilator infusion therapy. Angiography can provide superior anatomic detail not available from CTA or US. However, recent data suggest that if a patient is not clinically stable enough to undergo angiography, multidetector contrast-enhanced CT may provide adequate information to make a diagnosis of NOMI. Vasoconstriction may lead to bowel ischemia and necrosis with a mortality rate that has been reported to be 70%. Early diagnosis and treatment are critically important in acute mesenteric ischemia to avoid bowel infarction. Typically therapy consists of intra-arterial administration of vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, papaverine, or glucagon. Administration of high-dose intravenous prostaglandin E1 may be equally effective.</p>
<p><em>Variant 4: Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia</em></p>
<p>Chronic mesenteric ischemia most commonly occurs due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the mesenteric arteries (celiac axis, SMA, inferior mesenteric artery [IMA]). Signs and symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia include weight loss, sitophobia (food fear), and postprandial abdominal pain. Given the relatively rich collateral supply to bowel, signs and symptoms of ischemia typically occur when at least 2 arteries (and often all 3) are affected. Endovascular therapy, particularly PTA and stent placement, has supplanted open surgical repair as the preferred therapy for mesenteric-origin stenoses in patients without bowel infarction. Mortality and morbidity are believed to be lower for endovascular interventions compared to open repair; however, more patients develop recurrent symptoms and require reintervention following endovascular treatment than after open repair. Complications of endovascular treatment include distal mesenteric embolization, branch perforation, dissection, stent dislodgement, and stent thrombosis.</p>
<p><em>Variant 5: Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome</em></p>
<p>The median arcuate ligament is a fibrous band connecting the right and left hemidiaphragms that is present in everyone and results in celiac axis narrowing in 20% of the population. The incidence and even existence of abdominal symptoms due to compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament is debatable. The compression has been postulated to limit blood flow to bowel, with resulting ischemic symptoms, or to irritate the celiac ganglion, which results in abdominal pain. Compression of the celiac artery may be a normal finding in asymptomatic patients and is well characterized. Therefore, supportive treatment with analgesics and continued diagnostic evaluation for alternate causes of abdominal pain might be reasonable first steps in patients with suspected median arcuate ligament syndrome.</p>
<p>Patients with imaging evidence of celiac axis compression have been treated with best results in patients who had both celiac decompression (surgical division of the ligament) and some form of celiac artery revascularization. Predictors of successful outcome in 1 study were &quot;postprandial pain pattern (81% cured), age between 40 and 60 (77% cured), and weight loss of 20 pounds or more (67% cured).&quot; There is no evidence supporting the use of stent placement in this entity, and endovascular dilation may be contraindicated unless ligament release has been performed first.</p>
<p><em>Variant 6: Venous Mesenteric Ischemia</em></p>
<p>Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) accounts for 5% to 15% of all cases of mesenteric ischemia. Patients may have abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. However, clinical diagnosis is often difficult because abdominal symptoms are nonspecific. Diagnosis can be established by noninvasive means, such as multidetector CT and MR venography. The mainstay of therapy is systemic anticoagulation. Generally, patients maintained on systemic anticoagulation have higher chances of recanalization of the occluded veins and lower odds of recurrence. Long-term systemic anticoagulation is usually required. Bleeding in the necrotic bowel may result, but this possibility should not delay systemic anticoagulation, and bleeding has to be treated if it occurs. Thrombolysis with or without mechanical thrombectomy may re-establish splanchnic venous flow and prevent bowel infarction in the setting of an acute or a subacute venous thrombosis. The rate of blood flow restoration by thrombolytic administration into the SMA appears to be lower than that of direct thrombolytic administration into the splanchnic veins.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommended therapy for acute mesenteric ischemia includes aspiration embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stenting for the treatment of underlying arterial stenosis. Systemic anticoagulation can be the sole therapy depending on the status of the patient but more often serves as a bridge to transcatheter or surgical evaluation of the thrombus. NOMI may respond to transarterial infusion of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, papaverine, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1. Side effects of vasodilator therapy include hypotension. </li>
    <li>Recommended therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia includes angioplasty with or without stent placement and, if an endovascular approach is not possible, surgical bypass or endarterectomy. Systemic anticoagulation can be complementary to the invasive procedures but is typically not offered as monotherapy. </li>
    <li>The diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome is controversial, but surgical release may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. </li>
    <li>Venous mesenteric ischemia may respond to systemic anticoagulation alone. Transhepatic or transjugular superior mesenteric vein catheterization and thrombolytic infusion can be offered depending on the severity of symptoms, condition of the patient, and response to systemic anticoagulation. Adjunct transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation can be considered for outflow improvement. </li>

<p>Of the 24 citations in the original bibliography, 24 were retained in the final document.</p>
<p>A new literature search was conducted in December 2013 and updated in November 2015 to identify additional evidence published since the <em>ACR Appropriateness Criteria&amp;reg; Radiologic Management of Mesenteric Ischemia</em> topic was finalized. Using the search strategies described in the literature search companion (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), 55 articles were found. Six articles were added to the bibliography. Forty-nine articles were not used due to either poor study design, the articles were not relevant or generalizable to the topic, the results were unclear, misinterpreted, or biased, or the articles were already cited in the original bibliography.</p>
<p>The author added 3 citations from bibliographies, Web sites, or books that were not found in the new literature search.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Rating Appropriateness</span></strong></p>
<p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness. When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.</p>
<p>The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category &quot;usually not appropriate&quot; where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category &quot;usually appropriate&quot; where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated &quot;may be appropriate,&quot; is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.</p>
<p>The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is &quot;May be appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized, and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the <a href=&quot;http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>Rating Round Information</a> document.</p>

    <li>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria (AC) and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. </li>
    <li>ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR AC through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply individual or society endorsement of the final document. </li>
