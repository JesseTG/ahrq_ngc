	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong>. Should antibiotics be routinely used in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute suggests that antibiotics should be used selectively, rather than routinely, in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong>. Should a colonoscopy be performed after an episode of acute diverticulitis confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests that colonoscopy be performed after resolution of acute diverticulitis in appropriate candidates to exclude the misdiagnosis of a colonic neoplasm if a high-quality examination of the colon has not been recently performed. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 3</strong>. Should elective colonic resection be performed after an initial episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests against elective colonic resection in patients with an initial episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The decision to perform elective prophylactic colonic resection in this setting should be individualized. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 4.</strong> Should a high fiber diet, rather than a regular diet, be advised in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests a fiber-rich diet or fiber supplementation in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 5</strong>. Should consumption of nuts and popcorn be avoided in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of acute diverticulitis to avoid consumption of nuts and popcorn. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 6</strong>. Should aspirin be avoided in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of acute diverticulitis to avoid the use of aspirin. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 7</strong>. Should nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) be avoided in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of nonaspirin NSAIDs if possible. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 8</strong>. Should mesalamine rather than placebo be used in patients with a history of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA recommends against the use of mesalamine after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. (<strong>Strong recommendation, Moderate quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 9</strong>. Should rifaximin rather than placebo be used in patients with a history of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests against the use of rifaximin after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 10</strong>. Should probiotics rather than placebo be used in patients with a history of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests against the use of probiotics after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 11</strong>. Should vigorous physical activity rather than regular activity be encouraged in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis?</p>
<p>The AGA suggests advising patients with diverticular disease to consider vigorous physical activity. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Defining the Clinical Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Through an iterative process, the authors of the technical review and the guideline panelists defined the clinical questions that the guideline would address. They focused on the medical management of patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis and developed 11 clinical questions that they considered relevant for clinicians. No question was excluded from the technical review. For each question, they specified the population of interest and one or more alternative management strategies (see Table 1 in the technical review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Clinical questions provided the framework for formulating study inclusion and exclusion criteria and guided the literature search.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Selecting the Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>For each question, the technical review authors developed a comprehensive list of potentially relevant outcomes. Then, along with the guideline panelists, they independently rated the importance of each outcome on a scale from 1 to 9, considering the patients' perspective. Outcomes with a median rating of 1 to 3 were considered not important to patients and were not included in the evidence tables. Outcomes with a median rating of 4 to 6 were considered important to patients, and outcomes with a median rating of 7 to 9 were considered critical to patients. The important and the critical outcomes were included in the evidence tables. At the end of the process, they readjusted the ratings to ensure consistency across clinical questions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Identifying the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimates of the Effect</strong></p>
<p>With the help of a specialized librarian, the technical review panel conducted an electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in August 2014. They first searched for recent systematic reviews (2009 and onward). The technical review authors then conducted a search for primary studies, using the search date of the latest systematic review identified as a starting point. Finally, the technical review panel reviewed the reference lists of included studies and the <a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;ClinicalTrials.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>ClinicalTrials.gov</a> Web site for additional trials. The literature search is described in detail in Appendix 1 of the technical review.</p>
<p>The methodologist screened the list of hits retrieved and obtained the full text of relevant citations. The inclusion and exclusion of studies was decided by consensus of the technical review team. Included studies were restricted to randomized trials but included observational studies when there were no data from randomized trials.</p>
<p><strong>Values and Preferences</strong></p>
<p>The technical review team also conducted a search for studies evaluating the values and preferences of patients in relation to outcomes and treatment alternatives for diverticulitis. They conducted an electronic search in November 2014 of MEDLINE and EMBASE without a time limit.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evaluating the Quality of the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The technical review panel assessed the quality of evidence using the system described by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. In short, the quality of evidence is classified as &quot;high,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;low,&quot; or &quot;very low&quot; based on the study design and judgments about methodological characteristics of the available body of evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The quality of the evidence reflects the review team's confidence that the estimates of the effect calculated from the body of evidence lie close to their true value.</p>
<p>In the GRADE approach, randomized trials start as high-quality evidence, but the evidence can be rated down if the primary studies have a high risk of bias, the results are imprecise, there is substantial inconsistency, there is a high probability of publication bias, or the evidence found does not apply directly to the proportion of interest. Observational studies, in turn, start as low-quality evidence, and it is also possible to rate down the quality with the situations just mentioned. However, it is also possible to increase the quality of the evidence in special situations, such as a large observed effect or the observation of a dose-responsive gradient.</p>
<p>In each clinical question, the methodologist evaluated the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Those judgments were discussed with the rest of the technical review team, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. The technical review panel considered the overall quality of the evidence as the lowest rating among the critical outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence Tables</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence review team summarized the estimates of the effect and the judgments regarding the quality of the evidence in the tables. They used the alternative format proposed by Carrasco-Labra et al, because evidence shows that this format improves understanding of risk differences and helps with the interpretation of the results.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline was developed by the American Gastroenterological Association' s (AGA's) Clinical Guidelines Committee and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Briefly, the AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and best practices as outlined by the Institute of Medicine. GRADE methodology was used to prepare the accompanying technical review on focused questions and their related specific populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review. The quality of available evidence on each question was first judged by the technical review panel of content and methodological experts (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Reasons justifying grading are detailed in the following text when appropriate. The guideline authors, none of whom have any potential financial or professional conflict of interest on the topic, met with the technical review panel to discuss the evidence. The guideline authors subsequently met privately and drafted recommendations, taking into account the quality of evidence as well as the balance between benefits and harms, patient preferences, and resource utilization. Such pertinent considerations are also detailed in the guideline text when relevant. The strength of the recommendations was categorized as strong, conditional, or no recommendation according to GRADE terminology (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p></div>"/>
