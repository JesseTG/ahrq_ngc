	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Genetic Test Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical laboratories rarely sequence through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) gene or interrogate every known variant position. Instead, they typically test for variants that are used to determine high frequency allele haplotypes using the star-allele (*) nomenclature system, found at The Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database (<a href=&quot;http://www.cypalleles.ki.se&quot; title=&quot;The Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database Web site&quot;>http://www.cypalleles.ki.se</a>). Supplementary Table S1 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) and tables found on the <a href=&quot;https://www.pharmgkb.org/&quot; title=&quot;PharmGKB Web site&quot;>PharmGKB Web site</a> contains a list of <em>CYP2D6</em> alleles, the specific combination of variants that can be used to determine the allele, functional status, and frequency across major ethnic populations, as reported in the literature. </p>
<p>Genetic test results are reported as diplotypes, or the combination of the maternal and paternal alleles (e.g., <em>CYP2D6*1/*2</em>). Phenotypes are assigned based on the reported <em>CYP2D6</em> diplotype, as summarized in Table 1, below.</p>
<p>The limitations of genetic testing as described here include: (1) rare variants are often not detected; (2) known star (*) alleles not tested for will not be reported, and, instead, the patient will be reported as a <em>*1</em>; and (3) tests are not designed to detect unknown or <em>de novo</em> variants. The Supplementary Data (&quot;Genetic Test Interpretation&quot; section) contains additional information regarding <em>CYP2D6</em> genetic test interpretation and phenotype assignment.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Available Genetic Test Options</span></strong></p>
<p>See Supplementary Material and <a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&quot; title=&quot;Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/</a> for more information on commercially available clinical testing options. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Incidental Findings</span></strong></p>
<p>Currently, there are no diseases or conditions consistently linked to the variation in the <em>CYP2D6 </em>gene independent of drug metabolism and response. </p>

<p>Table 2, below, summarizes the therapeutic recommendations for ondansetron and tropisetron based on CYP2D6 phenotype. Gene duplication has been shown to be associated with higher metabolism and clearance of ondansetron resulting in lower area under the plasma concentration-time curve. This translates clinically into a decreased response to ondansetron and tropisetron, specifically increased risk of vomiting in CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs). If the<em> CYP2D6</em> genotype is known, alternative 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist antiemetics not metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., granisetron) should be considered in CYP2D6 UMs. Although dolasetron, palonosetron, and ramosetron are also metabolized by CYP2D6 (Supplementary Table S3), limited evidence is available regarding the utilization of <em>CYP2D6</em> genetic variation to guide use of these drugs. </p>
<p>The strength of this recommendation is based on the evidence provided in Supplementary Table S2 and the availability of suitable antiemetics not metabolized by CYP2D6. Currently, there are limited published data to support a recommendation in CYP2D6 IMs and poor metabolizers (PMs). Of note, the prescribing information for intravenous (i.v.) Zofran states, based on unpublished data, that the pharmacokinetics of i.v. ondansetron did not differ between CYP2D6 PMs and CYP2D6 normal metabolizers (NMs).</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, there are no data available on CYP2D6 genotype's effect on ondansetron or tropisetron response in the pediatric patient populations, although there is no reason to suspect that <em>CYP2D6</em> genetic variation will affect this drug's metabolism differently in children compared with adults. Because CYP2D6 catalytic activity in neonates (&amp;lt;1 month old) depends strongly on developmental aspects, the impact of CYP2D6 in this patient population might be different than adults or older children. </p>

<p>Not applicable</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The syndrome of congenital prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram is associated with a risk of potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is commonly referred to as torsades de pointes. Drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as ondansetron, should generally be avoided in patients with this diagnosis, as well as in those patients considered borderline. In September 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication reporting a change to the medication label by adding a warning to avoid ondansetron use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. The alert also recommended electrocardiogram monitoring for patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval. In June 2012, the FDA issued another safety communication reporting changes to the ondansetron label regarding i.v. dosing. This alert recommended that no single i.v. dose should exceed 16 mg. The alert noted new evidence suggesting that QT prolongation is dose dependent. Therefore, in patients for whom genetic testing indicates intermediate or poor CYP2D6 metabolism, potentially elevated blood levels of ondansetron would suggest these patients might be at an even greater risk for torsades de pointes even with the 16 mg maximum dose. However, there are no clinical data demonstrating greater QT prolongation in CYP2D6 PMs. </p>
<p><em>CYP2D6</em> genetic variants do not account for all variations observed for ondansetron or tropisetron response. In addition to specific patients factors (such as smokers vs. nonsmokers and male vs. female), other genes have been implicated in the response to ondansetron, including the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 gene (<em>ABCB1</em>) and the genes for the serotonin 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B receptors. Genetic variation in <em>CYP3A5</em> has been found to influence concentrations of R-ondansetron; however, to date, there are no data to support how <em>CYP3A5</em> variation impacts antiemetic efficacy in individuals taking ondansetron and tropisetron. However, one study has found that variations in <em>CYP3A5</em> and <em>CYP1A1</em> impact systemic clearance and exposure of granisetron in pregnant women. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the role of variation in these genes in antiemetic therapy.</p>

<p>The PharmGKB Scientific Curator, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) coordinator or authors with experience in literature or systematic review conduct the literature review and present the results to the writing committee. A search of PubMed and OVID MEDLINE is performed using the keywords for the gene and drug of interest, for example: (gene name) OR (gene symbol) OR (dbSNP rs number) OR (gene common names) AND (drug name OR drug class name). Furthermore, papers listed on PharmGKB are cross-checked as there may be annotations for the papers and/or additional publications. Where available, evidence evaluating the outcomes when prescribing has been altered based on genetic testing is included. For most gene-drug pairs, randomized controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes with genotype-guided dosing versus conventional dosing are not available.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors searched the PubMed&amp;reg; database (1966 to September 2015) for the following keywords: (cytochrome P450 2D6 or CYP2D6) AND (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, palonosetron, ramosetron, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists). Using these search terms, 43 publications were identified. In addition, studies annotated in PharmGKB (<a href=&quot;http://www.pharmgkb.org&quot; title=&quot;The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase Web site&quot;>http://www.pharmgkb.org</a>) were identified. Study inclusion criteria included publications that included analyses for the association between <em>CYP2D6</em> genotypes and metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) or 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist-related adverse drug events or clinical outcomes. Non-English manuscripts were excluded. </p>
<p>The <em>CYP2D6</em> allele frequency tables (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) are updates of those previously published in CPIC guidelines. Updates to the <em>CYP2D6</em> allele frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed&amp;reg; database (1995 to July 2016). The following criteria were used for <em>CYP2D6</em>: (CYP2D6 or 2D6 or cytochrome P4502D6) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve &quot;full-text&quot; and &quot;English&quot; literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the <em>CYP2D6</em> frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Identification of Content Experts and Formation of Writing Committee</span></strong></p>
<p>Once a guideline topic has been approved by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) members and the Steering Committee, a senior author is identified through self-nomination or by request of the CPIC Steering Committee. The senior author takes responsibility for forming the writing committee and completing the guideline. The writing committee is multidisciplinary, comprising a variety of scientists, pharmacologists, and clinicians (e.g., pharmacists and physicians). Authors will have a track record of publication and/or expertise in the specific topic area of the guideline. PharmGKB assigns at least one Scientific Curator to each CPIC guideline writing committee who has expertise in searching, compiling and evaluating the evidence for gene-drug associations, and making it computable and available on&amp;nbsp;the PharmGKB Web site. Furthermore, PharmGKB curators often take primary responsibility for completing background gene and drug summaries, assigning likely phenotypes based on genotypes (i.e., &quot;Table 1&quot; in guidelines), literature review, as well as preparing supplementary material provided in each guideline (i.e., genotypes that constitute the star (*) alleles or haplotypes, frequencies of alleles in major race/ethnic groups, genetic test interpretation and availability, and evidence linking genotype with phenotype).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Therapeutic Recommendation and Assignment of Strength of the Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>The writing committee discusses the evaluation of the literature and develops a draft recommendation via Web conferences and email communication. CPIC's therapeutic recommendations are based on weighing the evidence summarized in the supplementary Evidence Table from a combination of preclinical functional and clinical data, as well as on any existing consensus guidelines. Evidence related to the suitability of alternative medications or dosing that may be used based on genetics must be weighed in assigning the strength of the recommendation. Overall, the therapeutic recommendations are simplified to allow rapid interpretation by clinicians and are presented in the Table 2 of each guideline and occasionally in an algorithm. </p>
<p>To assign strength to a recommendation, CPIC uses a transparent three category system (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field) for rating recommendations that was adopted with slight modification from the rating scale for evidence-based recommendations on the use of antiretroviral agents (<a href=&quot;http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AIDSinfo Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf</a>). Each recommendation also includes an assessment of its usefulness in pediatric patients. </p>
<p>CPIC guidelines currently focus on gene-drug pairs for which at least one of the prescribing recommendations is actionable (e.g., recommendation to alter a dose or consider an alternative drug based on the genotype-phenotype relationship). For these and many other gene-drug pairs, PharmGKB also contains clinical annotations that are genotype-based summaries of the association between a drug and a particular variant. Each clinical annotation is assigned a level of evidence depending on population, replication, effect size and statistical significance.</p>

<p>Once the writing committee has completed and approved a draft guideline, the draft guideline is circulated to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) co-leaders and coordinator for content review. The guideline is reviewed for compliance with the CPIC Standard Operating Procedures and required format. The guideline draft is then discussed on a CPIC conference call with all CPIC members and circulated to the members for further review and approval. At each stage, feedback is considered for incorporation into the guideline and/or revision of the guideline, as supported by the available evidence and expert clinical judgment of the senior author and writing committee. Finally, the guideline manuscript under goes typical external scientific peer review by the journal prior to publication. Current agreements with the American Society for <em>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</em> give the journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics the first right of refusal for publication of CPIC guidelines; as part of this agreement, the guidelines are freely posted to PharmGKB immediately upon publication.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>At this time, the evidence does not justify increasing the dose in cytochrome P450 2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) because dose adjustments based on CYP2D6 UMs have not been studied and a detailed recommendation of dosing for the different CYP2D6 phenotypes is missing. Additionally, there is a single intravenous (i.v.) dose maximum of 16 mg in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling that might prevent increases in dosing in certain situations. <em>CYP2D6</em> genotyping is reliable when performed in qualified laboratories (e.g., Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA]-certified).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>Rare <em>CYP2D6</em> variants may not be included in the genotype test used and patients with rare variants may be assigned a &quot;wild-type&quot; (<em>CYP2D6*1</em>) genotype by default. Thus, an assigned &quot;wild-type&quot; allele could potentially harbor a no or decreased function variant. Furthermore, it is important that the genetic testing platform include testing for gene copy number to identify CYP2D6 UMs. Caution should be used regarding molecular diagnostics of <em>CYP2D6</em> gene copy-number variation because commercially available genotyping results may differ between diagnostic laboratories depending on assay design. Like all diagnostic tests, <em>CYP2D6</em> genotype is one of multiple pieces of information that clinicians should consider when making their therapeutic choice for each patient. Furthermore, several other factors cause potential uncertainty in the genotyping results and phenotype predictions. These are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Data (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Disclaimer</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision-making, as well as to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health care provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be solely made by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property related to any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p>CPIC is a registered service mark of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Underlying Assumption</span></strong> </p>
<p>The key underlying assumption for all CPIC guidelines is that clinical high-throughput and pre-emptive genotyping will eventually become common practice and clinicians will increasingly have patients' genotypes available before a prescription is written. Therefore, CPIC guidelines are designed to provide guidance to clinicians as to how available genetic test results should be interpreted to ultimately improve drug therapy, rather than to provide guidance as to whether a genetic test should or should not be ordered.</p></div>"/>

<p>The guideline supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) contains resources that can be used within EHRs to assist clinicians in applying genetic information to patient care for the purpose of drug therapy optimization (see the &quot;Resources to incorporate pharmacogenetics into an electronic health record with clinical decision support&quot; section of the Supplementary Material). Clinical implementation resources include cross-references for drug and gene names to widely used terminologies and standardized nomenclature systems, workflow diagrams, a table that translates genotype test results into a predicted phenotype with genetic test interpretation, and example text for documentation in the electronic health record and point-of-care alerts.</p>
