	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Note from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)</strong>: The following is a summary of the recommendations of the AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline on the Surgical Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee. All readers of this summary are strongly urged to consult the full guideline and evidence report for this information. The AAOS work group is confident that those who read the full guideline and evidence report will see that the recommendations were developed using systematic evidence-based processes designed to combat bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility.</p>
<p>This summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone. Treatment decisions should be made in light of all circumstances presented by the patient. Treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient rely on mutual communication between patient, physician, and other healthcare practitioners.</p>

<p>The guideline development group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of PICO questions. These questions specify the patient population of interest (P), the intervention of interest (I), the comparisons of interest (C), and the patient-oriented outcomes of interest (O). They function as questions for the systematic review, not as final recommendations or conclusions. A full list of the original PICO questions can be viewed in Appendix III in the original guideline. Once established, these <em>a priori</em> PICO questions cannot be modified until the final guideline development group meeting.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline work group developed <em>a priori </em>article inclusion criteria for the review. These criteria are the &quot;rules of evidence&quot; and articles that did not meet them are, for the purposes of this guideline, not evidence.</p>
<p>To be included in the systematic reviews (and hence, in this guideline) an article had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Work Group Defined Criteria</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Study must be of an <em>osteoarthritis-related</em> injury or prevention thereof and at least 90% of patient population should have osteoarthritis. </li>
    <li>Study must be published in or after 1966 for <em>surgical treatment, rehabilitation, bracing, prevention</em> and <em>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</em>. </li>
    <li>Study must be published in or after 1966 for <em>x rays</em> and <em>nonoperative treatment</em>. </li>
    <li>Study must be published in or after 1966 for all others nonspecified. </li>
    <li>Study should have 10 or more patients per group. </li>
    <li>For surgical treatment a minimum of N days/months/year (refer to PICO questions for detailed follow up duration)</li>
    <li>For <em>nonoperative treatment</em> a minimum of N days/months/year (refer to PICO questions for detailed follow up duration)</li>
    <li>For <em>prevention studies</em> a minimum of N days/months/year (refer to PICO questions for detailed follow up duration)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Standard Criteria for all Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Article must be a full article report of a clinical study. </li>
    <li>Retrospective non-comparative case series, medical records review, meeting abstracts, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, historical articles, editorials, letters, and commentaries are <em>excluded</em>. Bibliographies of meta-analyses and systematic reviews will be examined to ensure inclusion of all relevant literature. </li>
    <li>Confounded studies (i.e., studies that give patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment) are <em>excluded</em>. </li>
    <li>Case series studies that have non-consecutive enrollment of patients are <em>excluded</em>. </li>
    <li>Controlled trials in which patients were not stochastically assigned to groups AND in which there was either a difference in patient characteristics or outcomes at baseline AND where the authors did not statistically adjust for these differences when analyzing the results are <em>excluded</em>. </li>
    <li>All studies evaluated as &quot;very low quality&quot; will be <em>excluded</em>. </li>
    <li>Composite measures or outcomes are <em>excluded</em> even if they are patient-oriented. </li>
    <li>Study must appear in a peer-reviewed publication. </li>
    <li>For any included study that uses &quot;paper-and-pencil&quot; outcome measures (e.g., SF-36), only those outcome measures that have been validated will be included. </li>
    <li>For any given follow-up time point in any included study, there must be &amp;ge;50% patient follow-up (if the follow-up is &amp;gt;50% but &amp;lt;80%, the study quality will be downgraded by one level). </li>
    <li>Study must be of humans. </li>
    <li>Study must be published in English. </li>
    <li>Study results must be quantitatively presented. </li>
    <li>Study must not be an in vitro study. </li>
    <li>Study must not be a biomechanical study. </li>
    <li>Study must not have been performed on cadavers. </li>
</ul>
<p>The guideline work group will only evaluate surrogate outcomes when no patient oriented outcomes are available.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline work group began the systematic review with a comprehensive search of the literature. Articles considered were published prior to January 2015 in four electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The medical librarian conducts the search using key terms determined from the guideline development group's PICO questions.</p>
<p>The guideline work group supplements the electronic search with a manual search of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications, recent systematic reviews, and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. Recalled articles are evaluated for possible inclusion based on the study selection criteria and are summarized for the guideline development group who assist with reconciling possible errors and omissions.</p>
<p>The study attrition diagram in Appendix IV in the original guideline provides a detailed description of the numbers of identified abstracts and recalled and selected studies that were evaluated in the systematic review of this guideline. The search strategies used to identify the abstracts are contained in Appendix V in the original guideline.</p></div>"/>

<p>The guideline work group included only the best available evidence for any given outcome addressing a recommendation. Accordingly, the group first included the highest quality evidence for any given outcome if it was available. In the absence of two or more occurrences of an outcome at this quality, the group considered outcomes of the next lowest quality until at least two or more occurrences of an outcome had been acquired. For example, if there were two 'moderate' quality occurrences of an outcome that addressed a recommendation, the group did not include 'low' quality occurrences of this outcome. A summary of the evidence that met the inclusion criteria, but was not best available evidence was created and can be viewed by recommendation in Appendix X in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Minimally Clinically Important Improvement</span></strong></p>
<p>Wherever possible, the effects of treatments were considered in terms of the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in addition to whether their effects are statistically significant. The MCID is the smallest clinical change that is important to patients, and recognizes the fact that there are some treatment-induced statistically significant improvements that are too small to matter to patients. However, there were no occurrences of validated MCID outcomes in the studies included in this clinical practice guideline.</p>
<p>When MCID values from the specific guideline patient population are not available, the following measures were used (listed in order of priority):</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>MCID/minimal important difference (MID) </li>
    <li>PASS or impact </li>
    <li>Another validated measure </li>
    <li>Statistical significance </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statistical Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Intervention/Prevention Data</strong></p>
<p>When possible, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Unit recalculates the results reported in individual studies and compile them to answer the recommendations. The results of all statistical analysis conducted by the AAOS EBM Unit are conducted using SAS 9.4. SAS was used to determine the magnitude, direction, and/or 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect. For data reported as means (and associated measures of dispersion) the mean difference between groups and the 95% confidence interval was calculated and a two-tailed t-test of independent groups was used to determine statistical significance. When published studies report measures of dispersion other than the standard deviation, the value was estimated to facilitate calculation of the treatment effect. In studies that report standard errors or confidence intervals the standard deviation was back-calculated. In some circumstances statistical testing was conducted by the authors and measures of dispersion were not reported. In the absence of measures of dispersion, the results of the statistical analyses conducted by the authors (i.e., the p-value) are considered as evidence. For proportions, the guideline work group reports the proportion of patients that experienced an outcome along with the percentage of patients that experienced an outcome. The variance of the arcsine difference was used to determine statistical significance. P-values &amp;lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>When the data was available, the guideline work group performed meta-analyses using the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird. A minimum of three studies was required for an outcome to be considered by meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I-squared statistic. Meta-analyses with I-squared values less than 50% were considered as evidence. Those with I-squared larger than 50% were not considered as evidence for this guideline. All meta-analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. The arcsine difference was used in meta-analysis of proportions. In order to overcome the difficulty of interpreting the magnitude of the arcsine difference, a summary odds ratio is calculated based on random effects meta-analysis of proportions and the number needed to treat (or harm) is calculated. The standardized mean difference was used for meta-analysis of means and magnitude was interpreted using Cohen's definitions of small, medium, and large effect.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline and systematic review were prepared by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Surgical Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee guideline physician guideline development group (clinical experts) with the assistance of the AAOS Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Unit in the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs (methodologists) at the AAOS. To develop this guideline, the guideline development group held an introductory meeting on August 16, 2013 to establish the scope of the guideline and the systematic reviews. As the physician experts, the guideline development group defined the scope of the guideline by creating population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) questions that directed the literature search. The original PICO questions developed at the introductory meeting can be viewed in Appendix III in the original guideline document. When necessary, these clinical experts also provided content help, search terms and additional clarification for the AAOS Medical Librarian. The Medical Librarian created and executed the search(es). The supporting group of methodologists (AAOS EBM Unit) reviewed all abstracts, recalled pertinent full-text articles for review and evaluated the quality of studies meeting the inclusion criteria. They also abstracted, analyzed, interpreted, and/or summarized the relevant data for each recommendation and prepared the initial draft for the final meeting. Upon completion of the systematic reviews, the physician guideline development group participated in a three-day recommendation meeting on April 10-12, 2015. At this meeting, the physician experts and methodologists evaluated and integrated all material to develop the final recommendations. The final recommendations and rationales were edited, written and voted on at the final meeting. Additional edits to the rationales were approved by the guideline development group on webinars after the meeting. The draft guideline recommendations and rationales received final review by the methodologists to ensure that these recommendations and rationales were consistent with the data. The draft was then completed and submitted for peer review on July 6, 2015.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommending For or Against a Procedure</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline development group considers the procedure of interest and comparison procedure when recommending or not recommending a procedure for clinical use. If the procedure of interest results in outcomes that are similar to the comparison procedure, the group may recommend both procedures due to no statistical difference in outcomes. If the procedure of interest results in outcomes that are not statistically different than a placebo or no procedure, the group may recommend against the procedure of interest, because it adds no measurable benefit to a patient's outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Defining the Strength of the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Judging the quality of evidence is only a stepping stone towards arriving at the strength of a guideline recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes.</p>
<p>Strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation. As such, the strength expresses how possible it is that a recommendation will be overturned by future evidence. It is very difficult for future evidence to overturn a recommendation that is based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect. It is much more likely that future evidence will overturn recommendations derived from a few small retrospective comparative studies. Consequently, recommendations based on the former kind of evidence are given a high strength of recommendation and recommendations based on the latter kind of evidence are given a low strength.</p>
<p>To develop the strength of a recommendation, AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength for each recommendation that took only the final quality and the quantity of evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Wording of the Final Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>To prevent bias in the way recommendations are worded, the AAOS uses specific predetermined language stems that are governed by the evidence strengths. Each recommendation was written using language that accounts for the final strength of the recommendation. This language, and the corresponding strength, is shown in the table below.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The draft guidelines were peer-reviewed, edited in response to that review and subsequently distributed for public commentary. Thereafter, the draft guideline was sequentially approved by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Committee on Evidence-Based Quality and Value, AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors. All AAOS guidelines are reviewed and updated or retired every five years in accordance with the criteria of the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC).</p>
<p>Thus the process of AAOS guideline development incorporates the benefits from clinical physician expertise as well as the statistical knowledge and interpretation of non-conflicted methodologists. The process also includes an extensive review process offering the opportunity for over 200 clinical physician experts to provide input into the draft prior to publication. This process provides a sound basis for minimizing bias, enhancing transparency and ensuring the highest level of accuracy for interpretation of the evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Peer Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the final meeting, the guideline draft undergoes peer review for additional input from external content experts. Written comments are provided on the structured review form (see Appendix VII in the original guideline). All peer reviewers are required to disclose their conflicts of interest. To guide who participates, the guideline development group identifies specialty societies at the introductory meeting. <em>Organizations</em>, not <em>individuals</em>, are specified.</p>
<p>The specialty societies are solicited for nominations of individual peer reviewers approximately six weeks before the final meeting. The peer review period is announced as it approaches and others interested are able to volunteer to review the draft. The chairs of the guideline development group and chair of the AAOS Committee on Evidence-Based Quality and Value reviews the draft of the guideline prior to dissemination.</p>
<p>Some specialty societies (both orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic) ask their evidence-based practice (EBP) committee to provide review of the guideline. The organization is responsible for coordinating the distribution of AAOS materials and consolidating their comments onto one form. The chair of the external EBP committees provides disclosure of their conflicts of interest (COI) and manages the potential conflicts of their members.</p>
<p>Again, the AAOS asks for comments to be assembled into a single response form by the specialty society and for the individual submitting the review to provide disclosure of potentially conflicting interests. The peer review stage gives external stakeholders an opportunity to provide evidence-based direction for modifications that they believe have been overlooked. Since the draft is subject to revisions until its approval by the AAOS Board of Directors as the final step in the guideline development process, confidentiality of all working drafts is essential.</p>
<p>The chairs of the guideline development group and the manager of the AAOS evidence-based medicine unit drafts the initial responses to comments that address methodology. These responses are then reviewed by the chair and co-chair, who respond to questions concerning clinical practice and techniques. The director of the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs may provide input as well. All comments received and the initial drafts of the responses are also reviewed by all members of the guideline development group. All proposed changes to recommendation language as a result of peer review are based on the evidence and undergoes majority vote by the guideline development group members. Final revisions are summarized in a detailed report that is made part of the guideline document throughout the remainder of the review and approval processes.</p>
<p>The AAOS believes in the importance of demonstrating responsiveness to input received during the peer review process and welcomes the critiques of external specialty societies. Following final approval of the guideline, all individual responses are posted on the AAOS Web site with a point-by-point reply to each non-editorial comment. Reviewers who wish to remain anonymous notify the AAOS to have their names de-identified; their comments, AAOS responses, and their COI disclosures are still posted.</p>
<p>Review of the Surgical Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee guideline was requested of 21 organizations. Seven individuals representing six organizations returned comments on the structured review form (see Appendix VII in the original guideline).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Public Commentary</span></strong></p>
<p>After modifying the draft in response to peer review, the guideline was subjected to a thirty-day period of &quot;Public Commentary.&quot; Commentators consist of members of the AAOS Board of Directors (BOD), members of the Council on Research and Quality (CORQ), members of the Board of Councilors (BOC), and members of the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS). The guideline is automatically forwarded to the AAOS BOD and CORQ so that they may review it and provide comment prior to being asked to approve the document. Members of the BOC and BOS are solicited for interest. If they request to see the document, it is forwarded to them for comment. Based on these bodies, over 200 commentators have the opportunity to provide input into this guideline. One organization returned public comments.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The AAOS Guideline Approval Process</span></strong></p>
<p>This final guideline draft must be approved by the AAOS Committee on Evidence-Based Quality and Value Committee, the AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors. These decision-making bodies are described in Appendix II in the original guideline document and are not designated to modify the contents. Their charge is to approve or reject its publication by majority vote.</p></div>"/>

Early postoperative complications include prosthetic infection, venous thromboembolic disease, arthrofibrosis, and pain. Late postoperative complications include infection, prosthetic aseptic loosening, and pain. All can lead to a need for revision arthroplasty.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Potential Harms of Specific Interventions</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The risks associated with peripheral nerve blockade may include bleeding, infection, and associated neural injury. Although rare, these potential risks need to be balanced with the documented benefits of peripheral nerve blockade. Depending upon clinical circumstances, peripheral nerve blockade may also be associated with postoperative motor weakness. Under these conditions, care must be taken to minimize the risk of patient falls or delayed mobilization during the hospitalization. </li>
    <li>There is a risk of renal injury with ketorolac injection. There is a theoretical risk of increased infection rates injecting corticosteroids into a surgical field. </li>
    <li>There is increased risk of acute intraoperative blood loss without a tourniquet. The possibility of poor fixation at the cement-bone interface exists. </li>
    <li>Care must be taken when utilizing tranexamic acid in patients at high risk for complications such as thromboembolic disease, and color blindness as this has not been adequately studied. This is not a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of this agent. The studies used to make this recommendation almost all have significant exclusion criteria, especially regarding patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or at high risk for the same. </li>
    <li>Patellar arthroplasty in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been associated with patella fracture or complications from patella insufficiency and the data suggests that this may increase over time. Not resurfacing the patella in the setting of TKA is associated with patella-related reoperations and all reoperations including infection and revision for which the association is not clearly understood. </li>
    <li>Retrospective reviews of the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register revealed higher 30-day mortality if bilateral knee arthroplasties were done at the same time versus staged within a year. Multiple retrospective reviews showed adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with simultaneous bilateral knee arthroplasties. One of these reviews helped define the higher risk patient by showing that patients who suffered a major complication had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including, specifically, chronic lung diseases, congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. </li>
    <li>Potential harms of not using a drain include increased incidence of knee stiffness requiring manipulation with resultant poor range of motion, and increased wound drainage. </li>
    <li>Intra-operative fracture during component insertion or failure of ingrowth may be of concern with certain cementless designs in patients with poor bone quality. </li>
    <li>The co-morbidity groups addressed in the risk factor recommendations each have wide spectrums of disease intensity and subsequent great variability in terms of marginally less good outcomes and higher risk. There is a possible risk of patients being treated as a member of a class, rather than as individuals. This is especially the case given that federal payments are increasingly being linked to rates of readmission and complications as well as cost and outcomes. The risk adjustments are not exact enough to protect hospitals and surgeons if they offer surgery to all patients from co-morbidity classes with higher risk or less good outcomes. Given the current pressures from value based payments, separating out the patients with lower expression of their co-morbidities for treatment is less likely than avoidance of the particular class as a whole, even if there is a high likelihood of success for selective cases. </li>
    <li>The study supporting the recommendation for an eight month delay to TKA does not speak to the effects in outcomes in longer delays, nor does it subcategorize patients at higher risk of permanent disability or injury from delay. </li>

    <li>Contraindications are relative and require an in depth discussion with the patient and physician (surgeon, anesthesiologist) about their individual risk factors. Additional factors, such as the individual's comorbidities, and/or specific patient characteristics may affect the physician's choice of treatment. Clinician input based on experience increases the probability of identifying patients who will benefit from specific treatment options. The individual patient and/or their decision surrogate dynamic will also influence treatment decisions, therefore, discussion of available treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient rely on mutual communication between the patient and/or decision surrogate and physician, weighing the potential risks and benefits for that patient. Once the patient and/or their decision surrogate have been informed of available therapies and have discussed these options with the patient's physician, an informed decision can be made. </li>
    <li>Neuraxial anesthesia should not be performed in patients with known contraindications to the technique. </li>
    <li>There are specific contraindications in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved uses of tranexamic acid that include color blindness. The surgeon should be aware of the several common exclusion criteria in the literature, specific contraindications, the experience with this agent in other specialties, and the evolving case report literature before using this agent indiscriminately. FDA contraindications for its approved usage include patients with acquired defective color vision, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, patients with active intravascular clotting, and patients with hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid. </li>

This Clinical Practice Guideline is not intended to be a fixed protocol, as some patients may require more or less treatment or different means of diagnosis.
