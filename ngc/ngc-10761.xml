	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Scaling and Root Planing (SRP)</strong></p>
<p>For patients with chronic periodontitis, clinicians should consider SRP as the initial treatment (<strong>In favor</strong>). The authors note that the strength of the recommendation is limited because SRP is considered the reference standard and thus used as an active control for periodontal trials and there are few studies in which investigators compare SRP with no treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic Subantimicrobial-Dose Doxycycline (SDD) and SRP</strong></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians may consider systemic SDD (20 milligrams twice a day) for 3 to 9 months as an adjunct to SRP, with a small net benefit expected (<strong>In favor</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Systemic Antimicrobials and SRP</strong></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians may consider systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP, with a small net benefit expected (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Locally Delivered Antimicrobials and SRP</strong></p>
<p><em>Chlorhexidine Chips and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians may consider locally delivered chlorhexidine chips as an adjunct to SRP with a moderate net benefit expected (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Doxycycline Hyclate Gel and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians may consider locally delivered doxycycline hyclate gel as an adjunct to SRP, but the net benefit is uncertain (<strong>Expert opinion for</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Minocycline Microspheres and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians may consider locally delivered minocycline microspheres as an adjunct to SRP, but the net benefit is uncertain (<strong>Expert opinion for</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Nonsurgical Use of Lasers and SRP</strong></p>
<p><em>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Diode Laser and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians may consider PDT using diode lasers as an adjunct to SRP, with a moderate net benefit expected (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Non-PDT Diode Laser and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians should be aware that the current evidence shows no net benefit from diode lasers (non-PDT) when used as an adjunct to SRP (<strong>Expert opinion against</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Neodymium:Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet (Nd:YAG) Laser and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians should be aware that the current evidence shows no net benefit from Nd:YAG lasers when used as an adjunct to SRP (<strong>Expert opinion against</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Erbium Laser and SRP</em></p>
<p>For patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, clinicians should be aware that the current evidence shows no net benefit from erbium lasers when used as an adjunct to SRP (<strong>Expert opinion against</strong>).</p>

<p>The authors searched 2 electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) and reviewed the references of selected systematic reviews to identify missed references. The search was first conducted in October 2012 and updated in July 2014.</p>
<p>The authors developed study inclusion and exclusion criteria through consensus. Briefly, they included randomized controlled trials if they were published after 1960, written in English, and reported changes in clinical attachment level (CAL) at least 6 months after randomization. They chose CAL as a primary outcome because probing depth changes fail to capture the effect of nonsurgical treatment. The authors included both parallel-arm and split-mouth studies. The authors excluded studies of aggressive periodontitis, as well as studies in which the adjunct was administered more than 1 week after scaling and root planing (SRP) or was reapplied to progressing (worsening) tooth sites. They screened all citations and full-text articles independently and in duplicate. In cases of discrepancies, they made decisions via discussion with the rest of the panel.</p>
<p>The authors excluded studies on debridement as the experimental treatment as well as studies using the terms <em>instrumentation</em>, <em>ultrasonic instrumentation</em>, <em>ultrasonic scaling</em>, or <em>subgingival scaling</em> to mean <em>debridement</em>.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Critical Appraisal of Individual Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>In groups of 2 (1 ADA staff member and 1 panelist for each paper), the authors independently reviewed and extracted the relevant data from included studies and appraised each study with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Details on the tool and summaries of the extracted data and critical appraisals are presented in the full report. In short, 6 domains are assessed and judged as low, unclear, or high risk of bias. Furthermore, a summary assessment risk of bias of the outcome across domains and across studies was conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook. The authors extracted information concerning adverse effects, which are described fully in the clinical practice guideline associated with this systematic review and in the unabridged version.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis and Meta-Analysis: Evaluating the Effect of the Intervention</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors decided to use clinical attachment level (CAL) as the primary outcome to compare the effectiveness of various periodontal therapies. They chose to subgroup results on the basis of trial design. The authors chose not to stratify the studies according to levels of disease at baseline. In assessing the effectiveness of scaling and root planing (SRP) alone (question 1), they compared mean change in CAL between SRP and controls. To assess adjuncts (question 2), they compared mean changes between groups receiving SRP and those receiving SRP plus an adjunct. The authors conducted meta-analyses by using the random effects model. </p>
<p>They noted inconsistency among studies regarding the number of tooth sites and teeth assessed. Investigators in some studies reported data for periodontal sites, whereas others reported data at the tooth level and whole-mouth averages. Whole-mouth measurements may lead to underestimation of the treatment effect by including healthy sites in the computation of teeth or mouth averages or of changes over time. The estimates in the meta-analyses include studies in which the investigators reported at these different levels of assessment.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Determining the Level of Certainty in the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors reviewed overall results for each treatment or adjunct and assessed the level of certainty in the evidence as high, moderate, or low (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The authors constitute a multidisciplinary panel of subject matter experts and American Dental Association (ADA) staff methodologists convened by the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs (CSA). The accompanying systematic review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provides the evidence base for this guideline.</p>
<p>The guideline panel addressed the following clinical questions, formatted in the Patient-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome style:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Question 1: In patients with chronic periodontitis, does scaling and root planing (SRP) (hand or ultrasonic), when compared with no treatment, supragingival scaling and polish (prophylaxis), or debridement, result in greater improvement of clinical attachment level (CAL)? </li>
    <li>Question 2: In patients with chronic periodontitis, does the use of locally delivered antibiotics or antimicrobials, systemic antibiotics, combinations of locally delivered and systemic antibiotics, agents for biomodification or host modulation, or nonsurgical lasers as adjuncts to SRP, compared with SRP alone, result in greater improvement of CAL? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Determining the Net Benefit Rating</span></strong></p>
<p>The development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines requires a determination of the net benefit rating for each intervention. The authors assessed each treatment's net benefit by evaluating its clinical benefits against its adverse effects (AEs). They evaluated the frequency and severity of AEs as reported in the included studies or by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In determining the net benefit rating of each treatment, the authors judged whether the benefits clearly outweigh the AEs; the benefits and AEs are balanced closely, or there is uncertainty in the estimate of the balance; or the AEs clearly outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Determining Strength of Clinical Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The clinical recommendation strength is a result of crossing the appropriate row (the guideline panel's determination of the level of certainty in the evidence as high, moderate, or low) and column (net benefit rating) (see the table below). The definitions for each level of recommendation strength are provided in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field.</p>

    <li>The AEs that were judged possibly to be related to subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline (SDD) in clinical trials were dizziness and tachycardia. The package insert lists the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials as headache, common cold, flu symptoms, and toothache. </li>
    <li>Antimicrobials as a class of drugs are well known to cause allergic reactions in some people. Other AEs commonly are reported (this list is not exhaustive), such as rash, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, although their rates of occurrence are often not statistically different in treated and control groups. In addition, the overuse of antimicrobials promotes the development of resistant strains of bacteria, which are a risk to the population. </li>
    <li>One case of nontreatment-related aphthae on the buccal mucosa was reported with locally delivered chlorhexidine chips as an adjunct to SRP. According to U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information, the most frequently observed AEs were toothache, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Oral pain or sensitivity may occur during the first week after SRP and chip placement, although in some cases it may occur later, but it is typically mild to moderate in severity and is expected to resolve within days. Post-marketing surveillance indicates that anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have occurred with dental products containing chlorhexidine. </li>
    <li>The package insert lists several potential AEs with doxycycline hyclate use such as headache, gingival discomfort (pain or soreness), toothache, periodontal problems (abscess, exudate, infection, drainage, extreme mobility, or suppuration), thermal tooth sensitivity, or sore mouth. The package insert also states that 1.6% of participants in a doxycycline hyclate (Atridox, CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals) clinical trial of more than 1,400 participants reported &quot;unspecified essential hypertension,&quot; whereas only 0.2% in the vehicle control arm and none in either the SRP or oral hygiene instruction arms reported this AE. There is no known association of oral doxycycline hyclate use with essential hypertension. </li>
    <li>The most common AEs with minocycline microspheres and SRP included headache, dental infection, increased periodontitis, tooth sensitivity, tooth caries, dental pain, gingivitis, and stomatitis. One study reported one AE (black hairy tongue) that was ruled to be possibly drug related. Other AEs were reported but judged not to be related to study medication. </li>

The recommendations in this document do not purport to define a standard of care.
