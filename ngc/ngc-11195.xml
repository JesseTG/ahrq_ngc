	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Domain 1: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What Are the Indications for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of Voriconazole (VORI)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: The TDM of VORI is recommended for patients with hepatic dysfunction, concomitant drugs that potentially influence VORI pharmacokinetics (PK), cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP450 2C19) mutants, poor response or adverse events, or life-threatening fungal infections (<strong>1D-E, strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence to expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: TDM of VORI is suggested for patients with conditions other than those mentioned in recommendation 1 (<strong>2B-D, conditional recommendation, moderate to very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: Which Parameter Should Be Monitored for VORI, the Peak or Trough Blood Concentration?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: The steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is recommended to be monitored (<strong>1B, strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: When Should the Initial Blood Sample Be Obtained to Perform TDM of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>: When the loading dose of VORI is given, an initial blood sample is suggested to be obtained no earlier than immediately before the 5th dose (on the 3rd day of treatment) (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: What Is the Target Trough Blood Concentration of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>: The trough blood concentration of VORI is recommended to be maintained above 0.5 mg&amp;bull;L<sup>-1</sup> (<strong>1B, strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong>: The trough blood concentration of VORI is recommended to be maintained below 5 mg&amp;bull;L<sup>-1</sup> (<strong>1B, strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Under What Conditions Should TDM of VORI Be Repeated?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong>: TDM of VORI is recommended to be repeated when adjusting the VORI dosing regimen, patients show a poor response or adverse events, or when initiating or withdrawing concomitant drugs that potentially influence VORI PK (<strong>1E, strong recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 6: How Should the VORI Dosing Regimen Be Adjusted if Necessary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong>: Population PK methods are suggested to be used to adjust the VORI dosing regimen when a population PK model based on a native population is available (<strong>2E, conditional recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9</strong>: If the patient's steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is below 0.5 mg&amp;bull;L<sup>-1</sup> or the response is poor, maintaining dosage of VORI is suggested to be increased by 50%, followed by dosage adjustment based on the blood concentration (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 10</strong>: If the patient's steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is within 5-10 mg&amp;bull;L<sup>-1</sup> without &amp;ge;grade 2 adverse events, maintaining dosage of VORI is suggested to be decreased by 20%, followed by dosage adjustment based on the blood concentration (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11</strong>: If the patient's steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is above 10 mg&amp;bull;L<sup>-1</sup> or has grade 2 adverse events, VORI administration is suggested to be skipped once, with the maintenance dosage decreased by 50%, followed by dosage adjustment based on the blood concentration (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Domain 2: Special Groups of Patients</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 7: How Should VORI Be Administered to Patients with Severe Hepatic Dysfunction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 12</strong>: For patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, VORI is not suggested for first-line treatment. After balancing the benefits and harms, VORI can be used for these patients under rigorous TDM and hepatic function monitoring (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Domain 3: Drug Safety</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 8: What Measures Should Be Taken to Rescue VORI Overdose?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 13</strong>: Temporarily withdrawing VORI, TDM and supportive treatment with evident adverse events are recommended to rescue VORI overdose (<strong>1D, strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 9: What Measures Should Be Taken to Address Common Adverse Events of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 14</strong>: The recommended indications to withdraw VORI are as follows: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level above 5 upper limits; total bilirubin (T-Bil) level above 3 upper limits; severe neurologic, psychiatric or eyesight symptoms with limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL); skin rash covering &amp;gt;30% body surface area (BSA), with limiting self-care ADL or sleep or with oral corticosteroid indicated (<strong>1E, strong recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 15</strong>: The recommended indications to decrease the VORI dosage are as follows: ALT or AST level above 3 upper limits; ALP or GGT level above 2.5 upper limits; T-Bil level above 1.5 upper limits; moderate neurologic, psychiatric or eyesight symptoms with limiting instrumental use ADL; skin rash covering between 10% and 30% BSA, with limiting instrumental use ADL or with oral medications indicated (<strong>2E, conditional recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 10: What Is the Compatibility of VORI?</strong></p>

The Guideline Development Group (GDG) systematically collected related evidence and completed 9 systematic reviews (3 were further updated). References were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, and Sinomed) until January 26, 2016 using the single search term &quot;voriconazole&quot;. For some of the questions that could not be answered by a systematic review, evidence was also collected systematically via a process of searching and identifying references. Only data from Asian people were considered for safety outcomes unless the data were only available from non-Asian people. Pharmacokinetic outcomes were used as surrogates of efficacy and safety outcomes. In addition, the GDG investigated 119 patients from 9 Chinese hospitals who were taking VORI on their values and preferences towards therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of VORI and cytochrome P2C19 (CYP2C19) gene test. The hospitals were selected with regards to regions distribution, and the patients were selected through convenience sampling. A 6-minute video was played for investigated patients regarding background information for the questionnaire (i.e., explanation of medical vocabulary, potential benefits and harms of voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring [VORI TDM] and CYP2C19 gene test, costs). All the research results were presented to the GCP while formulating recommendations.</p>
