	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

<p><strong>Genetic Test Interpretation </strong></p>
<p>The assignment of the likely SLCO1B1 phenotype, based on * allele diplotypes, has been summarized in Table 1 below, based on rs4149056. <em>SLCO1B1</em> alleles are often named using * allele nomenclature, representing various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alone or in combination (see Supplementary Table S1 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) that are associated with low SLCO1B1 protein expression or function (see Supplementary Table S2 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The minor C allele at rs4149056 is contained within <em>SLCO1B1*5</em> (rs4149056 alone) as well as the <em>*15 </em>and <em>*17 </em>haplotypes and is associated with lower plasma clearance of simvastatin. The magnitude of this effect is similar for the <em>*5</em>, <em>*15</em>, and <em>*17 </em>haplotypes. <em>SLCO1B1</em> alleles have been extensively studied in multiple geographically, racially, and ethnically diverse groups. In general, rs4149056 is present at a minor allele frequency of between 5 and 20% in most populations (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Although all <em>SLCO1B1</em> genetic tests interrogate rs4149056, other variants in this gene are also likely to be important, but their interpretation and application to statin prescribing is less clear. One of the limitations inherent in any genotype-only test is that very rare or <em>de novo</em> variants, which might have functional importance, will not generally be included.</p>

<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>In 2011 (updated in 2013), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added warnings to the simvastatin product label to direct providers away from initiating at the 80-mg simvastatin dose. The agency's recommendations are further summarized in Supplementary Table S7 online (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recently issued updated clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of elevated blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including guidelines for which patients should receive which statin at which intensity. Based on these new guidelines, it is anticipated that increasing numbers of patients will receive statin therapy; however, it is unclear as to what extent the incidence of statin-induced myopathy will also be affected. At lower simvastatin doses (e.g., 40 mg daily), it is the authors' position that <em>SLCO1B1</em> genotype (if available) could be used to warn providers about modest increases in myopathy risk for patients with a C allele at rs4149056. In these circumstances, the authors recommend a lower dose of simvastatin or use an alternative statin (e.g., pravastatin or rosuvastatin), and they also highlight the potential utility of routine creatine kinase (CK) surveillance (see Table 2, below). If patients with a C allele at rs4149056 do not achieve optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering efficacy with a lower dose (e.g., 20 mg) of simvastatin, the authors recommend that the prescribing physician consider an alternate statin based on (i) potency differences (i.e., use a lower dose of a higher potency statin such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin); (ii) drug&amp;ndash;drug interactions (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors); and (iii) relevant comorbidities (e.g., trauma, significant renal impairment, post&amp;ndash;solid organ transplant, thyroid disease). </p>
<p>At the time of this writing, there are no data available regarding <em>SLCO1B1</em> genotype effects on simvastatin response or myopathy in pediatric patients, and no data to show that the rs4149056 SNP in <em>SLCO1B1</em> affects simvastatin's disposition differently in children compared with adults.</p>
<p>Use of clinical decision support tools within electronic health records can assist clinicians in using genetic information to optimize drug therapy. Clinical implementation resources include workflow diagrams (see Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]), tables that translate genotype test results into an interpreted phenotype, example text for documentation in the electronic health record and point-of-care alerts, and cross-references for drug and gene names to widely used terminologies and standardized nomenclature systems (see Supplementary Tables S8&amp;ndash;S12 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>

    <li>Based on the highly prevalent use of simvastatin, a potential benefit of preemptive <em>SLCO1B1</em> testing is a significant reduction in the incidence of simvastatin-induced myopathies and rhabdomyolysis, by identifying those at significant risk and recommending a lower simvastatin dose or an alternative statin as appropriate. </li>
    <li>In addition, genotyping may promote statin adherence and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. </li>
</ul>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The most common statin-related adverse drug reaction (ADR) is skeletal muscle toxicity. Statin-related muscle problems include myalgias (pain without evidence of muscle degradation), myopathy (pain with evidence of muscle degradation), and rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle damage with acute kidney injury). Frequency varies by definition; but, overall, statin-related myalgias are common, occurring in 1% to 5% of exposed subjects. </li>
    <li>A possible risk could be an error in genotyping. Since genotypes are lifelong test results, any such error could stay in the medical record for the life of the patient. An error in genotyping could result in a decrease in simvastatin dose that was not otherwise necessary and could result in inadequate lipid-lowering therapy. </li>
    <li>Another potential risk to pre-emptive genotyping is that a patient's knowledge of a genetic profile associated with a high risk of adverse events may lead the patient to associate unrelated adverse events (i.e., nonspecific myalgias/arthralgias) to his/her statin therapy. If a patient then prematurely discontinues his/her statin and/or the physician reduces the dose, this may result in higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and cardiovascular risk. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written, and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making, as well as to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases that are not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health-care provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application being solely made by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to people or damage to property related to any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>For the 40-mg simvastatin dose, the relative risk of myopathy is 2.6 per copy of the C allele at rs4149056. The risk is higher for the 80-mg simvastatin dose (myopathy OR 4.5 for TC genotype, ~20.0 for CC genotype). Nonetheless, simvastatin-related muscle toxicity can still occur in the absence of rs4149056. Thus, a TT genotype does not imply the absence of another potentially deleterious variant in <em>SLCO1B1</em> or elsewhere. Further, because rs4149056 can also be inherited in combination with other <em>SLCO1B1</em> gene variants known to have protective effects, it should not be presumed that the C allele at rs4149056 confers risk with 100% certainty.</p></div>"/>
