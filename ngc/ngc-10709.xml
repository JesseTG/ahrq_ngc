      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the ratings of overall strength of evidence and recommendation categories are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conclusions and Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>On the basis of a high overall strength of evidence of effectiveness, venipuncture is recommended as a best practice to reduce blood culture contamination (false positive) rates in all hospital settings. The high overall strength of evidence rating is due to sufficient evidence of practice effectiveness from nine individual studies, all favoring venipuncture over catheter blood collection and demonstrating consistent and substantial reductions in blood culture contamination rates (mean odds ratio [OR] of 2.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.03&amp;ndash;3.57).</p>
<p>On the basis of a high overall strength of evidence of effectiveness, phlebotomy teams are recommended as a best practice to reduce blood culture contamination (false positive) rates in all hospital settings. The high overall strength of evidence rating is due to sufficient evidence of practice effectiveness from five individual studies, all favoring phlebotomy team over non-phlebotomist staff collection and demonstrating consistent and substantial reductions in blood culture contamination rates (mean OR of 2.58; 95% CI: 2.07&amp;ndash;3.20).</p>
<p>On the basis of an insufficient overall strength of evidence of effectiveness, no recommendation is made for or against prepackaged prep kits. The overall insufficient strength of evidence rating is based on evidence that indicates inconsistent and unlikely improvement in blood culture (false positive) contamination rates compared to venipuncture collections without prep kits in hospital settings from the results of seven trials in a broad range of hospital settings by multiple types of staff. For six of the seven studies, the prep kit failed to significantly reduce blood culture contamination relative to a standard practice, and the overall effect size was homogeneous and not statistically significantly different from collections without prep kits (mean OR of 1.12; 95% CI: 0.94&amp;ndash;1.35).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Overall Strength of Evidence Ratings</span></strong></p>
<p>The revised definitions for these categories, modeled after the US Preventive Services Task Force (2008) are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: An adequate volume of evidence is available and includes consistent evidence of substantial healthcare quality changes from studies without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Some evidence is available and includes consistent evidence of substantial healthcare quality changes from without major limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: Limited evidence is available and includes consistent evidence of moderate healthcare quality changes from a small number of studies without major limitations; OR the quality of some of the studies' design and/or conduct is limited.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient</strong>: Any estimate of an effect is very uncertain. Available evidence of effectiveness is:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Inconsistent or weak; OR </li>
    <li>Consistent but with a minimal effect; OR </li>
    <li>Contained in an inadequate volume to determine effectiveness </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Categories</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendation rating categories are consistent with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) group findings (2008) and reflect the extent to which the available evidence gives one confidence that a practice will do more good than harm.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend</strong>: The practice should be identified as a best practice for implementation in appropriate care settings, taking into account variations in implementation and/or care settings. This recommendation results from consistent and high or moderate overall evidence of effectiveness strength rating of desirable impacts.</p>
<p><strong>No recommendation for or against</strong>: The potentially favorable impact on care outcomes and/or error reduction is not sufficient, or not sufficiently supported by evidence to indicate that it should be identified as a best practice for implementation in appropriate care settings. Additional studies may be warranted to strengthen the relevant evidence base. This recommendation results from insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend against</strong>: The practice should not be identified as a best practice for implementation because of consistent evidence of adverse effects.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The question answered by this evidence review is: <em>What practices are effective for reducing blood culture contamination?</em> This review question is addressed in the context of an analytic framework for the quality issue of blood culture contamination depicted in Figure 1 in the original guideline document. The relevant PICO elements are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Population: all patients in healthcare settings who have a blood culture specimens collected </li>
    <li>Intervention (practice) versus <em>C</em>omparison:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Venipuncture versus intravenous catheter collection </li>
        <li>Phlebotomy team versus non-phlebotomist staff collection </li>
        <li>Prepackaged prep kit versus no prep kit for venipuncture collection </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Outcome: blood culture contamination rate is the direct outcome of interest </li>
</ul>
<p>The search for studies of practice effectiveness included a systematic search of multiple electronic databases, hand searching of bibliographies from relevant information sources, consultation with and references from experts in the field including members of the expert panel, and by solicitation of unpublished quality improvement studies resulting in direct submissions to the Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Initiative. The literature search strategy and terms were developed with the assistance of a research librarian and included a systematic search in September 2011 of three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL) for English language articles from 1995 to 2012 about human subjects. The search contained the following Medical Subject Headings: allied health personnel, blood, blood specimen collection, catheterization, disinfectants, health personnel, laboratory personnel, phlebotomy as well as these keywords: anti-infective agent, local; antisepsis; blood sampling; blood culture; catheter; contaminants; contamination; costs; disinfection; health care cost(s); healthcare personnel; intravenous catheter; microbiology; paramedical personnel; phlebotomists; phlebotomy team; skin; skin decontamination; quality; and venipuncture.</p>
<p>Included studies were considered to provide valid and useful information addressing the review question, with findings for at least one blood culture contamination rate outcome measure. To reduce subjectivity and the potential for bias, all screening, abstraction and evaluation was conducted by at least two independent reviewers, and all differences were resolved through consensus.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="136" ordby="515" id="408" name="Number of Source Documents" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The search identified 456 separate bibliographic records that were screened for eligibility to contribute evidence of effectiveness for the three practices (venipuncture, phlebotomy teams, and prepackaged prep kits) with respect to blood culture contamination rate outcomes. After initial screening, 348 of these records were excluded as off-topic, and 87 were excluded for not meeting effectiveness study inclusion criteria (i.e., a study using data evaluating a practice of interest with at least one finding for a relevant blood culture contamination rate outcome measure). A total of 21 full-text studies met the review inclusion criteria. A systematic review flow diagram in Figure 2 in the original guideline document provides a breakdown of the search results. The full-text review and evaluation of the 21 eligible studies (10 venipuncture; 6 phlebotomy team; 6 prep kits), with one evaluating two practices, resulted in excluding 4 studies (1 venipuncture; 1 phlebotomy team; 2 prep kit) for not meeting the minimum required Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Initiative (LMBP) study quality inclusion criteria. Appendix C (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provides a Body of Evidence table for each practice, as well as abstracted and standardized information and study quality ratings in evidence summary tables for each of the 21 eligible studies. Appendix B provides bibliographic reference information for these studies.</p>
<p>A total of 17 studies are included in this review as evidence of practice effectiveness (9 venipuncture; 5 phlebotomy team; 4 prep kits). One published study contained data evaluating 2 practices and another published study contains 4 studies at separate sites resulting in a total of 7 prep kit studies.</p></div>"/>

To reduce subjectivity and the potential for bias, all screening, abstraction and evaluation was conducted by at least two independent reviewers, and all differences were resolved through consensus.</p>
<p>The effect size for each study was standardized using its reported data and results to calculate an odds ratio (OR) since the outcome of interest is dichotomous (i.e., blood culture is contaminated or is not contaminated) and the findings for these practices are typically expressed in terms of rates or percentages. The OR compares the intervention practice to the comparison practice, or comparator, in terms of the relative odds of a successful outcome (i.e., no contamination versus contamination). Each study is assigned one of three quality ratings (Good, Fair, Poor) and one of three effect size ratings (Substantial, Moderate or Minimal/None). (Note: The criteria for a substantial effect size rating: OR&amp;gt;2.0 and significantly different from OR=1.0 at p=0.05 [i.e., the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is &amp;gt;1.0].)</p>
<p>The results from the individual effectiveness studies are aggregated into a practice body of evidence that is analyzed to produce the systematic review results for translation into an evidence-based recommendation (Recommend, No recommendation for or against, Recommend against). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses are used to assess the effect size consistency and patterns of results across studies, and to rate the overall strength of the body of evidence for practice effectiveness (High, Moderate, Suggestive, and Insufficient). The qualitative analysis synthesizes the individual studies to convey key study characteristics, results and evaluation findings summarized in a body of evidence table. The quantitative analysis is provided using meta-analysis of results from similar individual studies to provide a weighted average effect size and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated using a random-effects model* and presented in a forest plot with the individual studies' and overall mean odds ratios along with their respective 95% confidence interval upper and lower limits. The I<sup>2</sup> statistic is used to estimate the percent of variability associated with between-study differences.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Random-effects model assumes there is no common population effect size for the included studies and the studies' effect size variation follows a distribution with the studies representing a random sample. This is in contrast to the fixed-effects model which assumes a single population effect size for all studies and that observed differences reflect random variation.</p></div>"/>

<p>Venipuncture, like catheter collection, is a primary means of blood sample collection for blood cultures; however the cost of this practice has not been evaluated. Four studies of phlebotomy teams included estimated and projected labor costs and healthcare savings (e.g., reduced hospital length of stay, pharmacy and laboratory services) associated with reduced blood culture contamination rates or false positives. Some studies' estimated savings were associated with either a general reduction in blood culture contamination rates or relied on other sources for key cost-related assumptions. All four studies concluded that the healthcare cost savings from reduced contaminated blood cultures exceeded total phlebotomist labor costs, however they did not compare phlebotomist to non-phlebotomist costs (i.e., implies $0 cost for non-phlebotomist labor). Nonetheless, these studies all support a conclusion that phlebotomy teams are not only cost-effective but cost-saving solely based on reduction in blood culture contamination.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Initiative (LMBP) systematic review methods are consistent with practice standards for systematic reviews, but all similar methods are imperfect and include subjective assessments at multiple points that may produce bias. Rating study quality depends on consensus assessments that may be affected by rater experience and the criteria used. Publication bias must be considered although this review contains unpublished studies which may help mitigate that bias. The restriction to English language studies to satisfy the requirement of multiple reviewers for each study may also introduce bias. Most of the evidence for this review is from quality improvement studies, thus the primary data have many limitations, including single institution site-specific differences which may affect study results. Many studies were missing information including actual study sample sizes, dates for relevant time periods, and practice implementation and setting characteristics. Several studies were conducted in specific settings within a hospital such as emergency departments, medical intensive care units and academic settings which may not be generalizable to other settings. Individual study comparison group settings were not always identical, therefore potential differences in practice patterns and patient clinical status could influence results.</p>
<p>Several studies included in this review have study periods that are more than ten years old, with three dating to the early 1990s; two for venipuncture; one for phlebotomy teams; and six of the seven prep kit study periods began prior to or in 2000. Five of the nine studies used a paired blood culture sample study design comparing venipuncture and catheter blood samples from the same patient within a pre-defined time limit, while the other four studies used groupwise comparisons. Although systematic differences are not observed and all nine included studies favored venipuncture, the non-paired design may yield less valid findings when blood culture contamination is affected by patient or setting characteristics. Three of the five phlebotomy team studies used comparison groups of non-phlebotomists performing only venipuncture collections, thereby controlling for the possibility of catheter contamination. Although systematic differences were not observed, it is likely that the results from these three studies were more representative of the practice's true effect size. All five studies favored phlebotomy teams, but the two studies with non-phlebotomist catheter collections in the comparison group may have had a slight upward bias on the meta-analysis mean effect size estimate. Several studies in this review noted study design limitations in terms of phlebotomy teams and non-phlebotomist staff which may have introduced confounding results on reported blood culture contamination rates and effect sizes due to differences in the skill level and training of staff performing venipuncture.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Feasibility of Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>Venipuncture is feasible in all settings and patient populations with some special patient case exceptions as noted in the applicability section. The evidence reviewed clearly demonstrates the feasibility of adopting phlebotomy teams in a variety of hospital settings. Implementing phlebotomy teams for blood culture collection may require assessment of the availability of currently trained phlebotomist staff in various areas of the hospital settings and possible reorganization of resources. In settings where phlebotomy has been decentralized or eliminated, changes may be instituted to achieve workforce goals. Selected environments where high volumes of blood cultures are initiated at specific hours of the workday may be an excellent starting point for implementation. Phlebotomist salaries and training costs may be perceived as initial barriers to adoption of phlebotomy teams, therefore an assessment of blood culture contamination rates and associated costs within an institution may be helpful to support perceived additional costs for implementing phlebotomy teams compared to using non-phlebotomist staff. Involvement from multiple, relevant departments and leaders within an organization to support implementation will likely be required.</p></div>"/>
