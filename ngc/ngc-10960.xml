	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li><strong>For well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (&amp;ge;38.0&amp;deg;C [100.4&amp;deg;F]), are there clinical predictors that identify patients at risk for urinary tract infection?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. None specified. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. Infants and children at increased risk for urinary tract infection include females younger than 12 months, uncircumcised males, nonblack race, fever duration greater than 24 hours, higher fever (&amp;ge;39&amp;deg;C), negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and no obvious source of infection. Although the presence of a viral infection decreases the risk, no clinical feature has been shown to effectively exclude urinary tract infection. Physicians should consider urinalysis and urine culture testing to identify urinary tract infection in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever &amp;ge;38&amp;deg;C (100.4&amp;deg;F), especially among those at higher risk for urinary tract infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>For well-appearing febrile infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years undergoing urine testing, which laboratory testing method(s) should be used to diagnose a urinary tract infection?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. Physicians can use a positive test result for any one of the following to make a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years: urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, or Gram's stain. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>.</p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Physicians should obtain a urine culture when starting antibiotics for the preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years. </li>
        <li>In febrile infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with a negative dipstick urinalysis result in whom urinary tract infection is still suspected, obtain a urine culture. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>For well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (&amp;ge;38.0&amp;deg;C [100.4&amp;deg;F]), are there clinical predictors that identify patients at risk for pneumonia for whom a chest radiograph should be obtained?</strong>
    <p><em><strong>Level A recommendations</strong></em>. None specified. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. In well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (&amp;ge;38&amp;deg;C [100.4&amp;deg;F]) and no obvious source of infection, physicians should consider obtaining a chest radiograph for those with cough, hypoxia, rales, high fever (&amp;ge;39&amp;deg;C), fever duration greater than 48 hours, or tachycardia and tachypnea out of proportion to fever. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. In well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (&amp;ge;38&amp;deg;C [100.4&amp;deg;F]) and wheezing or a high likelihood of bronchiolitis, physicians should not order a chest radiograph. </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>For well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 1 month to 3 months (29 days to 90 days) presenting with fever (&amp;ge;38.0&amp;deg;C [100.4&amp;deg;F]), are there predictors that identify patients at risk for meningitis from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. None specified. </p>
    <p><em><strong>Level C recommendations</strong></em>.</p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Although there are no predictors that adequately identify full-term well-appearing febrile infants aged 29 to 90 days from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained, the performance of a lumbar puncture may still be considered. </li>
        <li>In the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days diagnosed with a viral illness, deferment of lumbar puncture is a reasonable option, given the lower risk for meningitis. When lumbar puncture is deferred in the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days, antibiotics should be withheld unless another bacterial source is identified. Admission, close follow-up with the primary care provider, or a return visit for a recheck in the emergency department (ED) is needed. (<strong>Consensus recommendation</strong>) </li>

<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations</strong>. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, &quot;consensus&quot; is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based.

<p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 methodologists and assigned a Class of Evidence. Each article was assigned a design class with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (i.e., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using a predetermined process related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a final Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were ultimately not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade &quot;X&quot; and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of young pediatric patients with fever but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
