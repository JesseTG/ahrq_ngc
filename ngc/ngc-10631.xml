	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p>Definitions for terms used in the guideline recommendations are detailed in the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosing and Investigating Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)</strong></p>
<p>Recognise regurgitation of feeds as a common and normal occurrence in infants that:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is due to gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) &amp;ndash; a normal physiological process in infancy </li>
    <li>Does not usually need any investigation or treatment </li>
    <li>Is managed by advising and reassuring parents and carers </li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that in a small proportion of infants, GOR may be associated with signs of distress or may lead to certain recognised complications that need clinical management. This is known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).</p>
<p>Give advice about GOR and reassure parents and carers that in well infants, effortless regurgitation of feeds:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is very common (it affects at least 40% of infants) </li>
    <li>Usually begins before the infant is 8 weeks old </li>
    <li>May be frequent (5% of those affected have 6 or more episodes each day) </li>
    <li>Usually becomes less frequent with time (it resolves in 90% of affected infants before they are 1 year old) </li>
    <li>Does not usually need further investigation or treatment </li>
</ul>
<p>When reassuring parents and carers about regurgitation, advise them that they should return for review if any of the following occur:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The regurgitation becomes persistently projectile </li>
    <li>There is bile-stained (green or yellow-green) vomiting or haematemesis (blood in vomit) </li>
    <li>There are new concerns, such as signs of marked distress, feeding difficulties or faltering growth </li>
    <li>There is persistent, frequent regurgitation beyond the first year of life </li>
</ul>
<p>In infants, children and young people with vomiting or regurgitation, look out for the 'red flags' in Table 1 in the original guideline document, which may suggest disorders other than GOR. Investigate or refer using clinical judgement.</p>
<p>Do not routinely investigate or treat for GOR if an infant or child without overt regurgitation presents with only one of the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing to feed, gagging or choking) </li>
    <li>Distressed behaviour </li>
    <li>Faltering growth </li>
    <li>Chronic cough </li>
    <li>Hoarseness </li>
    <li>A single episode of pneumonia </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider referring infants and children with persistent back arching or features of Sandifer's syndrome (episodic torticollis with neck extension and rotation) for specialist assessment.</p>
<p>Recognise the following as possible complications of GOR in infants, children and young people:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Reflux oesophagitis </li>
    <li>Recurrent aspiration pneumonia </li>
    <li>Frequent otitis media (for example, more than 3 episodes in 6 months) </li>
    <li>Dental erosion in a child or young person with a neurodisability, in particular cerebral palsy </li>
</ul>
<p>Recognise the following as possible symptoms of GOR in children and young people:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Heart Burn </li>
    <li>Retrosternal pain </li>
    <li>Epigastric pain </li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that GOR is more common in children and young people with asthma, but it has not been shown to cause or worsen it.</p>
<p>Be aware that some symptoms of a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cows' milk protein allergy can be similar to the symptoms of GORD, especially in infants with atopic symptoms, signs and/or family history. If a non-IgE-medicated cows' milk protein allergy is suspected, see the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG116&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>Food allergy in children and young people. Diagnosis and assessment of food allergy in children and young people in primary care and community settings</a> (NICE clinical guideline 116).</p>
<p>When deciding whether to investigate or treat, take into account that the following are associated with an increased prevalence of GORD:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Premature birth </li>
    <li>Parental history of heartburn or acid regurgitation </li>
    <li>Obesity </li>
    <li>Hiatus hernia </li>
    <li>History of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (repaired) </li>
    <li>History of congenital oesophageal atresia (repaired) </li>
    <li>A neurodisability </li>
</ul>
<p>GOR only rarely causes episodes of apnoea or apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs), but consider referral for specialist investigations if it is suspected as a possible factor following a general paediatric assessment.</p>
<p>For children and young people who are obese and have heartburn or acid regurgitation, advise them and their parents or carers (as appropriate) that losing weight may improve their symptoms (see also the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=48872&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10611&quot;>Obesity: identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in children, young people and adults</a> [NICE clinical guideline 189]).</p>
<p>Do not offer an upper gastrointestinal (GI) contrast study to diagnose or assess the severity of GORD in infants, children and young people.</p>
<p>Perform an urgent (same day) upper GI contrast study for infants with unexplained bile-stained vomiting. Explain to the parents and carers that this is needed to rule out serious disorders such as intestinal obstruction due to mid-gut volvulus.</p>
<p>Consider an upper GI contrast study for children and young people with a history of bile-stained vomiting, particularly if it is persistent or recurrent.</p>
<p>Offer an upper GI contrast study for children and young people with a history of GORD presenting with dysphagia.</p>
<p>Arrange an urgent specialist hospital assessment to take place on the same day for infants younger than 2 months with progressively worsening or forceful vomiting of feeds, to assess them for possible hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.</p>
<p>Arrange a specialist hospital assessment for infants, children and young people for a possible upper GI endoscopy with biopsies if there is:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Haematemesis (blood-stained vomit) not caused by swallowed blood (assessment to take place on the same day if clinically indicated; see also Table 1 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Melaena (black, foul-smelling stool; assessment to take place on the same day if clinically indicated; see also Table 1 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Dysphagia (assessment to take place on the same day if clinically indicated) </li>
    <li>No improvement in regurgitation after 1 year old </li>
    <li>Persistent, faltering growth associated with overt regurgitation </li>
    <li>Unexplained distress in children and young people with communication difficulties </li>
    <li>Retrosternal, epigastric or upper abdominal pain that needs ongoing medical therapy or is refractory to medical therapy </li>
    <li>Feeding aversion and a history of regurgitation </li>
    <li>Unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia </li>
    <li>A suspected diagnosis of Sandifer's syndrome </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider performing an oesophageal pH study (or combined oesophageal pH and impedance monitoring if available) in infants, children and young people with:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia </li>
    <li>Unexplained apnoeas </li>
    <li>Unexplained non-epileptic seizure-like events </li>
    <li>Unexplained upper airway inflammation </li>
    <li>Dental erosion associated with a neurodisability </li>
    <li>Frequent otitis media </li>
    <li>A possible need for fundoplication (see &quot;Surgery for GORD&quot; below) </li>
    <li>A suspected diagnosis of Sandifer's syndrome </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider performing an oesophageal pH study without impedance monitoring in infants, children and young people if, using clinical judgement, it is thought necessary to ensure effective acid suppression.</p>
<p>Investigate the possibility of a urinary tract infection in infants with regurgitation if there is:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Faltering growth </li>
    <li>Late onset (after the infant is 8 weeks old) </li>
    <li>Frequent regurgitation and marked distress </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initial Management of GOR and GORD</strong></p>
<p>Do not use positional management to treat GOR in sleeping infants. In line with <a href=&quot;http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Sudden-infant-death-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx&quot; title=&quot;NHS Web site&quot;>National Health Service (NHS) advice</a>, infants should be placed on their back when sleeping.</p>
<p>In breast-fed infants with frequent regurgitation associated with marked distress, ensure that a person with appropriate expertise and training carries out a breastfeeding assessment.</p>
<p>In formula-fed infants with frequent regurgitation associated with marked distress, use the following stepped-care approach:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Review the feeding history, <strong>then</strong> </li>
    <li>Reduce the feed volumes only if excessive for the infant's weight, <strong>then</strong> </li>
    <li>Offer a trial of smaller, more frequent feeds (while maintaining an appropriate total daily amount of milk) unless the feeds are already small and frequent, <strong>then</strong> </li>
    <li>Offer a trial of thickened formula (for example, containing rice starch, cornstarch, locust bean gum or carob bean gum). </li>
</ul>
<p>In breast-fed infants with frequent regurgitation associated with marked distress that continues despite a breastfeeding assessment and advice, consider alginate therapy for a trial period of 1 to 2 weeks. If the alginate therapy is successful continue with it, but try stopping it at intervals to see if the infant has recovered.</p>
<p>In formula-fed infants, if the stepped-care approach is unsuccessful (see recommendation above), stop the thickened formula and offer alginate therapy for a trial period of 1 to 2 weeks. If the alginate therapy is successful continue with it, but try stopping it at intervals to see if the infant has recovered.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacological Treatment of GORD</strong></p>
<p>Do not offer acid-suppressing drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RAs), to treat overt regurgitation in infants and children occurring as an isolated symptom.</p>
<p>Consider a 4-week trial of a PPI or H<sub>2</sub>RA for those who are unable to tell you about their symptoms (for example, infants and young children, and those with a neurodisability associated with expressive communication difficulties) who have overt regurgitation with 1 or more of the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing feeds, gagging or choking) </li>
    <li>Distressed behaviour </li>
    <li>Faltering growth </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a 4-week trial of a PPI or H<sub>2</sub>RA for children and young people with persistent heartburn, retrosternal or epigastric pain.</p>
<p>Assess the response to the 4-week trial of the PPI or H<sub>2</sub>RA, and consider referral to a specialist for possible endoscopy if the symptoms:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Do not resolve or </li>
    <li>Recur after stopping the treatment </li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing between PPIs and H<sub>2</sub>RAs, take into account:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The availability of age-appropriate preparations </li>
    <li>The preference of the parent (or carer), child or young person (as appropriate) </li>
    <li>Local procurement costs </li>
</ul>
<p>Offer PPI or H<sub>2</sub>RA treatment to infants, children and young people with endoscopy-proven reflux oesophagitis, and consider repeat endoscopic examinations as necessary to guide subsequent treatment.</p>
<p>Do not offer metoclopramide, domperidone or erythromycin to treat GOR or GORD without seeking specialist advice and taking into account their potential to cause adverse events.</p>
<p><strong>Enteral Tube Feeding for GORD</strong></p>
<p>Only consider enteral tube feeding to promote weight gain in infants and children with overt regurgitation and faltering growth if:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Other explanations for poor weight gain have been explored <strong>and/or</strong> </li>
    <li>Recommended feeding and medical management of overt regurgitation is unsuccessful </li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting enteral tube feeding for infants and children with faltering growth associated with overt regurgitation, agree in advance:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A specific, individualised nutrition plan </li>
    <li>A strategy to reduce it as soon as possible </li>
    <li>An exit strategy, if appropriate, to stop it as soon as possible </li>
</ul>
<p>In infants and children receiving enteral tube feeding for faltering growth associated with overt regurgitation:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Provide oral stimulation, continuing oral feeding as tolerated </li>
    <li>Follow the nutrition plan, ensuring that the intended target weight is achieved and that appropriate weight gain is sustained </li>
    <li>Reduce and stop enteral tube feeding as soon as possible </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider jejunal feeding for infants, children and young people:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Who need enteral tube feeding but who cannot tolerate intragastric feeds because of regurgitation <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>If reflux-related pulmonary aspiration is a concern </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Surgery for GORD</strong></p>
<p>Offer an upper GI endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies for infants, children and young people before deciding whether to offer fundoplication for presumed GORD.</p>
<p>Consider performing other investigations such as an oesophageal pH study (or combined oesophageal pH and impedance monitoring if available) and an upper GI contrast study for infants, children and young people before deciding whether to offer fundoplication.</p>
<p>Consider fundoplication in infants, children and young people with severe, intractable GORD if:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Appropriate medical treatment has been unsuccessful <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>Feeding regimens to manage GORD prove impractical, for example, in the case of long-term, continuous, thickened enteral tube feeding. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>"/>

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Review Questions and Protocols and Identifying Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The scope for this guideline (see Appendix B in the full version of the guideline [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) outlines the main areas where guidance is needed. The guideline development group formulated review questions based on the scope and prepared a protocol for each review question (see Appendix E in the full version of the guideline). These formed the starting point for systematic reviews of relevant evidence. Published evidence was identified by applying systematic search strategies (see Appendix F in the full version of the guideline) to the following databases: Medline (1948 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), 4 Cochrane databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment [HTA] database). Searches to identify economic studies were undertaken using the above databases and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). Where possible, search strategies were restricted to English language. If this was not possible, studies in languages other than English were not reviewed. Search filters were used to identify particular study designs, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs). There was no searching of grey literature, nor was hand searching of journals undertaken.</p>
<p>All the searches were updated and re-executed within 6 to 8 weeks of the start of the stakeholder consultation to ensure the reviews were up-to-date. This process was completed by April 2014.</p>
<p>GER and GERD are equivalent acronyms to GOR and GORD that reflect the American English spelling of oesophagus as esophagus. GER and GERD were included in the search strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>For this guideline, the review questions were judged on a number of outcomes. The justification for using these outcomes was based on their relevance to the groups covered by the guideline and consensus among members of the guideline development group. The guideline development group selected 7 or 8 outcomes for each review when assessing the effectiveness of a particular treatment. No further distinction was made with regard to whether each was critical or important to the guideline development group's decision-making. Outcomes included those that were felt to be desirable (for example reduction in overt regurgitation) and unwanted effects of treatment that it would be important to reduce to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporating Health Economics</strong></p>
<p>The aims of the health economic input to the guideline were to inform the guideline development group of new economic issues relating to reflux in children and young people, and to consider whether the recommendations continued to represent a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Health economic evaluations aim to integrate data on benefits (ideally in terms of quality adjusted life years [QALYs]), harms and costs of different care options.</p>
<p>Systematic searches for published economic evidence were undertaken for all clinical questions in the guideline.</p>
<p>The guideline development group prioritised a number of clinical questions where it was thought that economic considerations would be particularly important in formulating recommendations. For this guideline the areas prioritised for economic analysis were:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Antacids/alginates </li>
    <li>H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists </li>
    <li>Proton pump inhibitors </li>
    <li>Prokinetic agents </li>
    <li>Enteral tube feeding </li>
    <li>Fundoplication surgery </li>
</ul>
<p>A systematic search for published economic evidence was undertaken for these questions. Due to the limited evidence on the effectiveness of managing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in children, economic analysis was restricted to costs and resource use of each of the management approaches.</p>

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing and Synthesising Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Evidence relating to clinical effectiveness was reviewed and synthesised according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In the GRADE approach, the quality of the evidence identified for each outcome listed in the review protocol is assessed according to the factors listed below and an overall quality rating (high, moderate, low or very low) is assigned by combining the ratings for the individual factors.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Study design (as an indicator of intrinsic bias; this determines the initial quality rating) </li>
    <li>Limitations in the design or execution of the study (including concealment of allocation, blinding, loss to follow up; these can reduce the quality rating) </li>
    <li>Inconsistency of effects across studies (this can reduce the quality rating) </li>
    <li>Indirectness (the extent to which the available evidence fails to address the specific review question; this can reduce the quality rating) </li>
    <li>Imprecision (reflects the confidence in the estimate of effect and this can reduce the quality rating). For continuous variables (such as change in temperature) the guideline development group was asked to predefine minimally important differences (the smallest difference between treatments that healthcare professionals or patients think is clinically beneficial). However, the guideline development group was unable to agree these, so imprecision was graded based on the GRADE default for risk ratios and odds ratios of &amp;minus;0.75/1.25 and for continuous outcomes of SMD&amp;plusmn;0.5. </li>
    <li>Other considerations (including large magnitude of effect, evidence of a dose&amp;ndash;response relationship, or confounding variables likely to have reduced the magnitude of an effect; these can increase the quality rating in observational studies, provided no downgrading for other features has occurred) </li>
</ul>
<p>For each review question the highest available level of evidence was sought. The type of review question determines the highest level of evidence. For questions on therapy or treatment, the highest possible evidence level is a well-conducted systematic review or meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or an individual RCT. In the GRADE approach, a body of evidence based entirely on such studies has an initial quality rating of high, and this may be downgraded to moderate, low or very low if factors listed above are not addressed adequately. For questions on prognosis, the highest possible level of evidence is a controlled observational study (a cohort study or case&amp;ndash;control study), and a body of evidence based on such studies would have an initial quality rating of high, which might be downgraded to moderate, low or very low, depending on the factors listed above. For diagnostic tests, studies examining the performance of the test started as high quality if information on accuracy was required, but where an evaluation of the effectiveness of the test in the clinical management of the condition was required, evidence from RCTs or cohort studies was considered optimal.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, the body of evidence corresponding to each outcome specified in the review protocol was subjected to quantitative meta-analysis. In such cases, pooled effect sizes were presented as pooled risk ratios (RRs), pooled odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences. By default, meta-analyses were conducted by fitting fixed effects models, but where statistically significant heterogeneity was identified, random effects models were used to investigate the impact of the heterogeneity. Where quantitative meta-analysis could not be undertaken (for example because of heterogeneity in the included studies) the range of effect sizes reported in the included studies was presented. The GRADE profiles are not directly applicable to epidemiological studies or non-comparative cohort studies. Where these studies are presented, they are included in descriptive paragraphs and/or tables as appropriate.</p>
<p>For studies evaluating the accuracy of a diagnostic test, summary statistics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV] and likelihood ratios for positive and negative test results [LR+ and LR&amp;minus;, respectively]) were calculated or quoted where possible (see Table 4 in the full version of the guideline). The following definitions were used when summarising the likelihood ratios for the guideline development group:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Convincing: positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 10 or higher, negative likelihood ratio (LR&amp;minus;) 0.1 or lower </li>
    <li>Strong: LR+ 5 or higher (but less than 10), LR&amp;minus; 0.2 or lower (but higher than 0.1) </li>
    <li>Not strong: LR+ 4.9 or lower, LR&amp;minus; higher than 0.2 </li>
</ul>
<p>The following definitions were used when summarising the levels of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the guideline development group:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>High: 90% and above </li>
    <li>Moderate: 75% to 89% </li>
    <li>Low: 74% or below </li>
</ul>
<p>Particular emphasis was placed on the positive likelihood ratio, with a ratio of 5 or higher being considered a good indicator that a symptom or sign should be used.</p>
<p>Some studies were excluded from the guideline reviews after obtaining copies of the publications because they did not meet inclusion criteria specified by the guideline development group (see Appendix H in the full version of the guideline). The characteristics of each included study were summarised in evidence tables for each review question (see Appendix I of the full version of the guideline). Where possible, dichotomous outcomes were presented as relative risks (RRs) or ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous outcomes were presented as mean differences with 95% CIs or standard deviations (SDs).</p>
<p><strong>Incorporating Health Economics Evidence</strong></p>
<p>For economic evaluations, no standard system of grading the quality of evidence exists and included papers were assessed using a quality assessment checklist based on good practice in economic evaluation. Reviews of the relevant published health economic literature identified in the literature search are presented alongside the clinical effectiveness reviews in the full version of the guideline.</p>

Membership included two consultant paediatric gastroenterologists, two consultant paediatricians, one consultant in paediatric neurodisability, one paediatric surgeon, two general practitioners, one advanced paediatric nurse practitioner, one paediatric dietician, one health visitor and two patient/carer/consumer representatives.</p>
<p>Staff from the NCC-WCH provided methodological support for the guideline development process, undertook systematic searches, retrieval and appraisal of the evidence, and health economics modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Methodology</strong></p>
<p>This guideline was commissioned by NICE and developed in accordance with the guideline development process outlined in The Guideline Development Process &amp;ndash; Information for National Collaborating Centres and Guideline Development Groups (available from the <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>www.nice.org.uk</a>).</p>
<p>In accordance with NICE's Equality Scheme, ethnic and cultural considerations and factors relating to disabilities have been considered by the guideline development group throughout the development process and specifically addressed in individual recommendations where relevant. For further information, see the <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/about/who-we-are/policies-and-procedures/nice-equality-scheme&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>NICE Equality Scheme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence to Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for clinical care were derived using, and linked explicitly to, the evidence that supported them. In the first instance, informal consensus methods were used by the guideline development group to agree short clinical and, where appropriate, cost effectiveness evidence statements which were presented alongside the evidence profiles. Statements summarising the guideline development group' interpretation of the evidence and any extrapolation from the evidence used when making recommendations were also written to ensure transparency in the decision-making process. The criteria used in moving from evidence to recommendations were:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Relative value placed on the outcomes considered </li>
    <li>Consideration of clinical benefits and harms consideration of net health benefits and resource use </li>
    <li>Quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Other considerations (including equalities issues) </li>
</ul>
<p>The guideline development group also identified areas where evidence to answer its review questions was lacking and used this information to formulate recommendations for future research.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the guideline development process, formal consensus methods were used to consider all the clinical care recommendations and research recommendations that had been drafted. The guideline development group identified 9 &quot;key priorities for implementation&quot; (key recommendations) and 3 high priority research recommendations. The key priorities for implementation were those recommendations thought likely to have the greatest impact on clinical care and outcomes in the Nation Health Service (NHS) as a whole; they were selected using a variant of the nominal group technique (see the <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/article/PMG6/chapter/1%20Introduction&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>NICE guidelines manual 2012</a> [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The priority research recommendations were selected in a similar way.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A false positive diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) could potentially have adverse consequences, including unnecessary investigations, such as endoscopy, or the use of unnecessary treatments. Endoscopy is usually performed under sedation or more frequently under general anesthesia in children and there are small associated risks. Oesophageal pH monitoring can be a somewhat distressing investigation, requiring placement of a naso-oesophogeal probe. Unnecessary treatment with drugs such as acid suppressing agents (such as proton pump inhibitors [PPIs] or H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists [H<sub>2</sub>RAs]) is not high risk but nevertheless undesirable. Conversely, false negative clinical evaluation could result in delayed investigation or treatment. Avoidance of unnecessary radiation exposure was seen by the group as a very important priority. </li>
    <li>The group discussed the practicalities of using feed thickeners. They noted that there are number of feed thickening products available; both on prescription and over the counter. These products vary across commercial brands but are basically either pre-thickened formulae or products added to formula milk. The group was aware that both types of thickened feeds are associated with difficulties in achieving a successful feed, with reported resistance to the texture from the child and the increased viscosity effecting the feeding time. However, these difficulties did not outweigh the benefits of reducing reflux. </li>
    <li>Acid suppressing agents, such as H<sub>2</sub>RAs and PPIs, are generally well tolerated but do have potential side effects. Long-term acid suppression might have adverse consequences. Acid, for example, has a protective effect against bacterial gastrointestinal infection and studies have shown an increased incidence of salmonella infection in people using such agents. It is important, therefore, that widespread unnecessary usage be avoided, and that where these drugs are used, unnecessarily long-term usage be avoided. Other agents, such as metoclopramide and domperidone, which act as pro-kinetic agents do have significant associated adverse effects, such as neurological symptoms (dyskinetic effects). There are concerns with domperidone regarding potential dysrrhythmias. The group was therefore concerned that these should only be considered for use following specialist advice. </li>
    <li>It was the experience of the group that feeding exclusively via an enteral tube can create behavioural issues relating to oral food aversion when tube feeding is stopped. Enteral tube feeding can disrupt normal feeding behaviour and therefore can lead to long-term feeding difficulties. It was agreed that as a precautionary measure, oral stimulation should be continued throughout enteral tube feeding treatment. Dependent on the individual, the group felt a variety of tastes and textures should be explored. It was outlined by the group that using enteral tube feeding in children with faltering growth can result in the child receiving a quantity of feed that they had not previously been used to, and that this could potentially cause reflux. The group concluded that in the first instance the quantity and timing of feeding should be monitored to avoid this, as per the guideline recommendation for formula feeding. </li>
    <li>The GDG recognised certain circumstances in which jejunal feeding might be preferable to providing intra-gastric tube feeds. In some infants, children and young people receiving intra-gastric feeding, GOR may continue to be a significant concern to the degree that they are not able to tolerate it, resulting, for example, in very frequent overt regurgitation. Also, there are circumstances in which it is judged that reflux is associated with a high risk of pulmonary aspiration. By delivering the feed into the jejunum, the risk of reflux may be significantly less. The group recognised that placement of jejunal tubes can be difficult and displacement of such tubes may pose problems. This was not, therefore, a procedure to be undertaken unless there were clear indications. </li>
    <li>As with any invasive intervention, the benefits, risks and potential complications of fundoplication must be weighed up very carefully. The operation is performed relatively frequently, but there are several potential complications. The creation of the high pressure zone in the oesophagus will cause dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), particularly of solid foods. Typically, this symptom will resolve over the first 6 months after the procedure, but a restricted diet may initially be required. Frequently, children are unable to burp following the procedure. This leads to episodes of stomach distension, causing discomfort, particularly in relation to feeds. This is termed 'gas bloat'. While this symptom also tends to improve with time, it can be a cause of marked distress. Retching can be an intractable symptom following fundoplication, particularly in neurologically impaired children, although it is not possible to accurately predict prior to surgery which children will be most troubled by this symptom. </li>

    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summaries of product characteristics of any drugs. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>Remember that child maltreatment is common, can present anywhere, and may co-exist with other health problems, including gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). For more information, see the NICE guideline on <a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg89&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>child maltreatment</a>. </li>
    <li>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a medicine's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. </li>
    <li>Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If the patient is under 16, their family or carers should also be given information and support to help the child or young person to make decisions about their treatment. Healthcare professionals should follow the <a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-guide-to-consent-for-examination-or-treatment-second-edition&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health Web site&quot;>Department of Health's advice on consent</a>. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the <a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mental-capacity-act-making-decisions&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health Web site&quot;>code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act</a> and the supplementary <a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085476&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health National Archives Web site&quot;>code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards</a>. </li>
    <li>If a young person is moving between paediatric and adult services, care should be planned and managed according to the best practice guidance described in the Department of Health's <a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4132145&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health National Archives Web site&quot;>Transition: getting it right for young people</a>. </li>
    <li>Adult and paediatric healthcare teams should work jointly to provide assessment and services to young people with GORD. Diagnosis and management should be reviewed throughout the transition process, and there should be clarity about who is the lead clinician to ensure continuity of care. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision. </li>

<p><strong>Key Priorities for Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation.</p>
<p>Give advice about gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and reassure parents and carers that in well infants, effortless regurgitation of feeds:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is very common (it affects at least 40% of infants) </li>
    <li>Usually begins before the infant is 8 weeks old </li>
    <li>May be frequent (5% of those affected have 6 or more episodes each day) </li>
    <li>Usually becomes less frequent with time (it resolves in 90% of affected infants before they are 1 year old) </li>
    <li>Does not usually need further investigation or treatment </li>
</ul>
<p>In infants, children and young people with vomiting or regurgitation, look out for the 'red flags' in table 1 in the original guideline document, which may suggest disorders other than GOR. Investigate or refer using clinical judgement.</p>
<p>Do not routinely investigate or treat for GOR if an infant or child without overt regurgitation presents with only 1 of the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing to feed, gagging or choking) </li>
    <li>Distressed behaviour </li>
    <li>Faltering growth </li>
    <li>Chronic cough </li>
    <li>Hoarseness </li>
    <li>A single episode of pneumonia </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not offer an upper gastrointestinal (GI) contrast study to diagnose or assess the severity of gastrointestinal reflux disease (GORD) in infants, children and young people.</p>
<p>Arrange a specialist hospital assessment for infants, children and young people for a possible upper GI endoscopy with biopsies if there is:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Haematemesis (blood-stained vomit) not caused by swallowed blood (assessment to take place on the same day if clinically indicated; also see table 1 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Melaena (black, foul-smelling stool; assessment to take place on the same day if clinically indicated; also see table 1 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Dysphagia (assessment to take place on the same day if clinically indicated) </li>
    <li>No improvement in regurgitation after 1 year old </li>
    <li>Persistent, faltering growth associated with overt regurgitation </li>
    <li>Unexplained distress in children and young people with communication difficulties </li>
    <li>Retrosternal, epigastric or upper abdominal pain that needs ongoing medical therapy or is refractory to medical therapy </li>
    <li>Feeding aversion and a history of regurgitation </li>
    <li>Unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia </li>
    <li>A suspected diagnosis of Sandifer's syndrome </li>
</ul>
<p>In formula-fed infants with frequent regurgitation associated with marked distress, use the following stepped-care approach:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Review the feeding history, <strong>then</strong> </li>
    <li>Reduce the feed volumes only if excessive for the infant's weight, <strong>then</strong> </li>
    <li>Offer a trial of smaller, more frequent feeds (while maintaining an appropriate total daily amount of milk) unless the feeds are already small and frequent, <strong>then</strong> </li>
    <li>Offer a trial of thickened formula (for example, containing rice starch, cornstarch, locust bean gum or carob bean gum) </li>
</ul>
<p>In formula-fed infants, if the stepped-care approach is unsuccessful, stop the thickened formula and offer alginate therapy for a trial period of 1 to 2 weeks. If the alginate therapy is successful continue with it, but try stopping it at intervals to see if the infant has recovered.</p>
<p>Do not offer acid-suppressing drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RAs), to treat overt regurgitation in infants and children occurring as an isolated symptom.</p>
<p>Do not offer metoclopramide, domperidone or erythromycin to treat GOR or GORD without seeking specialist advice and taking into account their potential to cause adverse events.</p></div>"/>
