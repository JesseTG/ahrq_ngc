	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

In developing questions, the committee focused on issues of interest and importance to cystic fibrosis (CF) clinicians, patients, and their families. The committee chose not to address clinical situations for which recommendations have already been published (e.g., ivacaftor [IVA] therapy for patients aged 12 years or older with CF who carry at least one copy of the G551D mutation or 2- to 5-year-old patients with CF with gating mutations other than G551D) or if the question was of low priority and unlikely to change practice (e.g., IVA/lumacaftor [LUM] therapy for patients with CF with only one copy of F508del). A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published from database inception through April 2016 was conducted in Ovid, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library Scopus, and Google Scholar. They repeated the search in September 2017 and found no relevant new citations. </p>
<p>This search yielded 278 published reports that were examined independently by two reviewers against a set of eligibility criteria.

<p>The research team used RevMan to input data from studies that were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A RevMan database was customized in a manner that was consistent with the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) questions, including all outcomes as well as the subgroup analyses that were defined based on age and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (PPFEV<sub>1</sub>). Within each outcome, the data were input based on ivacaftor dose, creating two subgroups: 150 mg and 250 mg. PICOs #3 and #4 also involved different doses of lumacaftor and these were input separately. A draft of the RevMan database was piloted using one of the papers that was previously determined to be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Findings from this pilot test resulted in the need to consult with the Committee on several methodological issues, and the database was revised and finalized following these discussions.</p>
<p>Similar to the review of papers for eligibility in the meta-analysis, a parallel data abstraction procedure was followed in which two abstractors entered data into identical copies of the RevMan database. This procedure yielded two data sets that were exported, merged, and compared to identify discrepancies. These discrepancies were discussed and adjudicated, thereby generating a final RevMan database containing information for use in the meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Following parallel data abstraction and adjudication of discrepancies, the research team examined each eligible paper in relation to the PICO questions and subgroup analyses to determine which PICOs and subgroup analyses could be addressed with meta-analysis. This information was provided to physicians on the Committee with accompanying text that summarized which questions had no outcome data, only one source of outcome data, or two or more sources of outcome data. Members of the Committee indicated that these preliminary observations were consistent with their <em>a priori</em> expectations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Methodological Quality</span></strong></p>
<p>Shortcomings in the design or implementation of clinical research can impact the validity of findings. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis were therefore assessed for methodological quality with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, a feature of the RevMan software package. This process includes evaluation of a number of elements that can potentially impact the robustness of study data. As described in the Cochrane Handbook, parallel design studies, such as those meeting inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, can be biased in several ways.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>Meta-analytic techniques are used to obtain overall estimates of treatment effect across a series of studies. In settings where the underlying disease and treatment are common, there will be a large number of studies that can be included in a given meta-analysis. When 25 or more studies are available for analysis, there is sufficient information to provide confidence in any combined estimates, confidence intervals and statistical testing. In this setting, both the between and within-study variability can be estimated and used to calculate an overall treatment effect and appropriate meta-analytic methods can be applied.</p>
<p>There are fewer methods available for meta-analysis when the number of studies is small. In fact, one could argue that an assessment of between-study variability is uninformative when only two or three studies are available for analysis. As this is often the case for rare diseases, there has been some statistical development of techniques that can be used for meta-analyses based on a small number of studies. Given the rarity of CF and the limited number of studies available for this analysis, the data were synthesized using both fixed effects and random effects approaches to meta-analysis, including two current statistical approaches for meta-analysis that correct for the combination of a small number of studies. The underlying assumptions made in the computation of confidence intervals and statistical tests, and the properties of each approach are described below.</p>
<p>For research questions with only two pieces of outcome data, only fixed effects results were reported. For research questions with three or more pieces of outcome data, both random effects and fixed effects (as a means of sensitivity to the random effects) were reported. Categorical data were summarized as relative risks and rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Rate ratios were reported for outcomes based on symptom data (i.e., a specified set of events used to derive a composite endpoint). For example, where available in a study, each of the symptoms listed in appropriate column of Table 6 in the systematic review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) were combined into a single event of &quot;lower respiratory symptoms.&quot; Continuous data were summarized as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Co-chairs of the committee were selected by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) based on their experience in guideline development and their membership on the CFF Guidelines Committee. The committee for these guidelines was composed of an independent, multidisciplinary group of individuals with expertise and experience in CF care, and included pediatric pulmonologists, adult pulmonologists, a pharmacist, a nurse practitioner, and a respiratory therapist. An adult CF patient and a parent of a child with CF were included in the committee. To assist with the systematic data review and evidence grading, the committee also recruited a medical librarian, methodologist, clinical epidemiologist, and biostatistician.</p>
<p>The committee used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to assess the evidence and develop recommendations. GRADE classifies recommendations as strong or conditional (i.e., weak) (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). The strength of the recommendation is determined by the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, quality of evidence, variability in values and preferences, and resources. It is important to note that a conditional recommendation means that although the majority of patients and clinicians will follow the recommendation, there will be some conditions in which the recommendation may not be appropriate given individual circumstances, and the ultimate therapeutic decision will be based on clinical factors specific and unique to that individual patient. Conversely, even a strong recommendation should not be rigidly obeyed, and there may be circumstances under which a clinician or patient would not follow a strong recommendation. Further details on how the committee applied GRADE and the evidence-to-decision tables used to generate recommendations are available in the online supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Use of This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline is not meant to establish a standard of care. Rather, it represents an effort to summarize evidence and provide sensible clinical recommendations based on that evidence. Clinicians, patients, third-party payers, other stakeholders, and the courts should never view these recommendations as dictates. No guideline or specific recommendations can take into account all of the unique clinical circumstances leading to therapy decisions for individual patients. Therefore, no one charged with evaluating clinicians' actions should attempt to rigidly apply the recommendations from this guideline in a global fashion. This guideline is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), but rather to provide evidence-based recommendations for use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators in different populations of patients with CF. Clinicians, patients with CF, and parents of patients with CF will be able to use these recommendations when considering CFTR modulator therapy.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>When choosing committee members for these guidelines, all potential committee members were asked to complete a conflict of interest (COI) questionnaire regarding both fiduciary and financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of clinically available cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. The COI questionnaires were examined by a neutral and unbiased member of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Guidelines Steering Committee as well as the CFF Director of Medical Compliance. Any potential committee member who disclosed such a relationship was not invited to participate on the committee, and several members of the CFF Guidelines Committee were excluded because of potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Due to the CFF's potential COI in the creation of these guidelines, no CFF staff member participated in writing or discussion of the recommendations, and the CFF neither endorsed nor declined to endorse these recommendations. The only CFF staff present for the discussion of these recommendations were the Practice Guidelines Specialist and the Director of Medical Compliance, and neither of them participated in the creation of questions or the development of any recommendations. The CFF's role in the development of these guidelines was limited to funding for face-to-face meetings, telephone conference calls, the methodologist, the biostatistician, and the clinical epidemiologist. The medical librarian was recruited from Indiana University, which did not charge any fees for her effort.</p>
