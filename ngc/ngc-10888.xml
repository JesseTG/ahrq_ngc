	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the levels of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, <strong>very low</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations to Aid in Decisions Regarding Diagnostic Testing for Intensive Care Unit-acquired Weakness (ICUAW)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: The committee recommends well-designed, adequately powered and executed randomized controlled trials comparing physical rehabilitation or other alternative treatments with usual care in patients with ICUAW that measure and report patient-important outcomes. (<strong>strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: The committee recommends clinical research to determine the role of prior patient disability in the development of and recovery from ICUAW. (<strong>strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: The committee recommends clinical research that determines whether or not patients would want to know if they have ICUAW even though no specific therapy currently exists and how patient preferences influence medical decision making or the perception of prognosis. (<strong>strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Remarks</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations are strong because the guideline development committee is certain that additional research is necessary to prove whether physical rehabilitation or other interventions improve outcomes in patients with ICUAW, and such evidence is necessary before deciding whether or not routine diagnostic testing for ICUAW is indicated.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Preferences</span></strong></p>
<p>These recommendations place a higher value on avoiding potentially burdensome diagnostic testing if it will not lead to improved outcomes and a lower value on an uncertain improvement in the rate of discharges home rather than to a rehabilitative facility.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The identified evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In the four level grading system (high, moderate, low, and very low quality evidence), randomized trials begin with the assumption of high quality evidence, whereas well-conducted observational studies (e.g., cohort studies, case-control studies) begin with an assumption of low quality evidence. The quality of evidence can be downgraded or upgraded on the basis of predefined criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The decision of whether to recommend an intervention was made by consensus and based upon four criteria: the quality of evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, patient values and preferences related to the intervention and outcomes, and resource use.</p>
<p>A <strong>strong recommendation</strong> was made when there was certainty about the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, whereas a <strong>weak recommendation</strong> was made when there was less certainty or the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences was finely balanced.</p></div>"/>

<p>A systematic literature review developed the bibliography for the guideline development process. A single search strategy was used, because each of the questions is related to the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW). A sensitive search strategy was developed by the committee's medical librarian, which combined Medical Subject Headings and various keywords. The search strategy shown in Table E2 in the supplemental material (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) was initially performed in March of 2009 and then was periodically updated during the development of the guideline. Two panelists selected relevant studies using the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized clinical trial, observational study, or case series (enrolling three or more patients); (2) exclusive enrollment of patients aged 18 years or older; and (3) explicit reporting of diagnostic testing for ICUAW. Disagreement was adjudicated through consensus of the same reviewers. The same two panelists examined the bibliographies of the selected articles and related reviews for additional studies, reviewed the studies, extracted crude data, and appraised the quality of each article.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The strategy was developed to be inclusive of all tests used in identifying critically-ill patients with ICUAW. It was designed as a starting point and did not preclude the use of other terms. Medline (1950-March 10, 2009), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (up until March 2009), EMBASE (1980-March 2009), and EBSCO (1982-March 2009) were searched. June 2012 was the most recent search date for this document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The initial search, excluding duplicate reports from multiple databases based on title, identified 419 citations. Iterative review yielded 84 unique studies (see Figure E1 in the supplemental material). The committee focused their analysis on prospective studies with explicit (i.e., reproducible) diagnostic methods. Using these criteria, 31 studies were identified (see Table E4 in the supplemental material). Agreement between abstractors on study selection was near perfect, with a kappa statistic of 0.91.</p></div>"/>

<p>These guidelines were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach in accordance with American Thoracic Society (ATS) policies. The Critical Care and Nursing Assemblies of the ATS sponsored the project. Invitations were sent out by the committee chair and planning committee to an initial list of experts who were asked for nominations. Twenty-two individuals accepted, representing multiple stakeholder disciplines from North America and Europe. Four individuals could not participate, and two members were excluded from voting, leaving 16 voting members (see Table E1 in the online supplement; see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Formulation of Questions and Definition of Important Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline development committee met to discuss the primary findings from the prior panel, review diagnostic issues in intensive-care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW), and identify important clinical questions (see below). The committee discussed what potential benefits patients could experience if an accurate diagnosis was made. The committee also identified the downsides of diagnostic testing.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Questions Used in the Deliberations of How to Make the Diagnosis of ICUAW</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In which critically ill patient groups does ICUAW occur with a significantly increased frequency? </li>
    <li>What tests are used to identify ICUAW and how are they applied in critically ill patients? </li>
    <li>How is electrophysiological testing used in critically ill patients when making the diagnosis of ICUAW? </li>
    <li>What is the recommended practical approach to identifying critically ill patients who develop ICUAW? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Developing Recommendations</span></strong> </p>
<p>Recommendations were considered based on the balance of beneficial versus adverse outcomes, quality of evidence, burdens, costs, and patient preferences. If it was unclear whether a particular course of action was favorable or unfavorable even after weighing these factors collectively, a recommendation was made for further research.</p>
<p>See Table E10 in the online supplement for voting results for iterative discussions and recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>A <strong>strong recommendation</strong> was made when there was certainty about the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, whereas a <strong>weak recommendation</strong> was made when there was less certainty or the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences was finely balanced.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Testing for and treatment of intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is a promising management strategy for which, thus far, there is insufficient evidence of benefit to support its use. The committee members believe that further research has the potential for reducing uncertainty about the effects of this management strategy and that the results of such research will be of good value for the anticipated costs. </li>
    <li>Despite the lack of current evidence, there are several reasons that many members of the guideline development committee perform routine diagnostic testing to identify patients with ICUAW in their clinical practices. First, ICUAW is associated with worse clinical outcomes, and nonrecognition could lead to inappropriate expectations of recovery. Second, many believe that the potential, albeit unproven, benefits of physical therapy outweigh the downsides, because therapy can be performed without harm to the patient and with minimal burden to providers. Third, patients with ICUAW appear at risk for recurrent respiratory failure and nosocomial pneumonia possibly related to reduced neuromuscular reserve. Respiratory therapists or others could focus on respiratory support and pulmonary airway clearance in patients with ICUAW to minimize these risks. Finally, a clear phenotypic description of these patients could facilitate further research to explore causes and interventions. </li>
    <li>Although there are important reasons to diagnose ICUAW, there are also several limitations to the committee's approach that were discussed during their deliberations. The limitations include the committee's lack of understanding of how to interrupt the pathophysiology that leads to ICUAW, the heterogeneity of critically ill populations, and limitations inherent to the tools available. Finally, the reduced quality of life and poor functional independence of critically ill patients after critical illness needs further research to define the impact of reduced strength on this outcome. </li>
