<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Blood Management Program</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Establishment</strong> </p>
<p>Health-care services should establish a multidisciplinary, multimodal perioperative patient blood management program (<strong>Grade C</strong>). This should include preoperative optimisation of red cell mass and coagulation status; minimisation of perioperative blood loss, including meticulous attention to surgical haemostasis; and tolerance of postoperative anaemia.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>To implement the above recommendations, a multimodal, multidisciplinary patient blood management program is required. All surgical patients should be evaluated as early as possible to coordinate scheduling of surgery with optimisation of the patient's haemoglobin and iron stores (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Procedural Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH) requires a local procedural guideline that addresses patient selection, vascular access, volume of blood withdrawn, choice of replacement fluid, blood storage and handling, and timing of reinfusion (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Intraoperative cell salvage requires a local procedural guideline that should include patient selection, use of equipment and reinfusion. All staff operating cell salvage devices should receive appropriate training, to ensure knowledge of the technique and proficiency in using it (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Anaemia and Haemostasis Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Preoperative Anaemia Assessment</strong></p>
<p>In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative anaemia should be identified, evaluated and managed to minimise red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, which may be associated with an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and hospital length of stay (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, preoperative anaemia should be identified, evaluated and managed to minimise RBC transfusion, which may be associated with an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>To implement the above recommendations, a multimodal, multidisciplinary patient blood management program is required. All surgical patients should be evaluated as early as possible to coordinate scheduling of surgery with optimisation of the patient's haemoglobin and iron stores (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>All surgical patients should be evaluated as early as possible to manage and optimise haemoglobin and iron stores (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Elective surgery should be scheduled to allow optimisation of patients' haemoglobin and iron stores (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Iron and Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs)</strong></p>
<p>In surgical patients with, or at risk of, iron-deficiency anaemia, preoperative oral iron therapy is recommended (<strong>Grade B</strong>). Refer to the preoperative haemoglobin assessment and optimisation template (Appendix F in the original guideline document) for further information on the optimal dosing strategy.</p>
<p>In patients with preoperative anaemia, where an ESA is indicated, it must be combined with iron therapy (<strong>Grade A</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with postoperative anaemia, early oral iron therapy is not clinically effective; its routine use in this setting is not recommended (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p>Surgical patients with suboptimal iron stores (as defined by a ferritin level &amp;lt;100 &amp;mu;g/L) in whom substantial blood loss (blood loss of a volume great enough to induce anaemia that would require therapy) is anticipated, should be treated with preoperative iron therapy (<strong>Practice Point</strong>). Refer to the preoperative haemoglobin assessment and optimisation template (Appendix F in the original guideline document) for further information on the evaluation and management of preoperative patients.</p>
<p>In patients with preoperative iron-deficiency anaemia or depleted iron stores, treatment should be with iron alone. In patients with anaemia of chronic disease (also known as anaemia of inflammation), ESAs may be indicated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>). Refer to the preoperative haemoglobin assessment and optimisation template (Appendix F in the original guideline) for further information on the evaluation and management of preoperative patients.</p>
<p><strong>Haemostasis Management</strong></p>
<p>In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) either with or without cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (CPB) (off-pump coronary artery bypass [OPCAB]), clopidogrel therapy should be stopped, where possible, at least 5 days before surgery (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, it is reasonable to continue low dose aspirin therapy. This may require specific evaluation in neurosurgery and intraocular surgery (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy should be ceased preoperatively to reduce blood loss and transfusion (<strong>Grade C</strong>). The timing of the cessation should reflect the agent's pharmacology.</p>
<p>In patients undergoing minor dental procedures, arthrocentesis, cataract surgery, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy without biopsy or colonoscopy without biopsy, warfarin may be continued (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, aspirin may be continued until the time of surgery (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients receiving clopidogrel who are scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery or other invasive procedures, a multidisciplinary approach should be used to decide whether to cease therapy or defer surgery, balancing the risk of bleeding and thrombotic events. Specific evaluation is required for patients who had a recent stroke, or received a drug-eluting stent within the last 12 months or a bare metal stent within the last 6 weeks. If a decision is made to cease therapy preoperatively, this should occur 7 to 10 days before surgery (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients receiving warfarin who are scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery or other invasive procedures (excluding minor procedures&amp;mdash;see recommendation above), specific management according to current guidelines is required (e.g., guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis) (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Blood Conservation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Preoperative</strong></p>
<p><em>Preoperative Autologous Donation (PAD)</em></p>
<p>The <em>routine</em> use of PAD is not recommended because, although it reduces the risk of allogeneic RBC transfusion, it increases the risk of receiving any RBC transfusion (allogeneic and autologous) (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Intraoperative</strong></p>
<p><em>Prevention of Hypothermia</em></p>
<p>In patients undergoing surgery, measures to prevent hypothermia should be used (<strong>Grade A</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Appropriate Patient Positioning</em></p>
<p>Excessive venous pressure at the site of surgery should be avoided by appropriate patient positioning, both during and after the procedure (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Deliberate Induced Hypotension</em></p>
<p>In patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or major joint replacement, if substantial blood loss (blood loss of a volume great enough to induce anaemia that would require therapy) is anticipated, deliberate induced hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure [MAP] 50&amp;ndash;60 mmHg) should be considered, balancing the risk of blood loss and the preservation of vital organ perfusion (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Acute Normovolaemic Haemodilution (ANH)</em></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing surgery in which substantial blood loss (blood loss of a volume great enough to induce anaemia that would require therapy) is anticipated, the use of ANH should be considered (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>ANH requires a local procedural guideline that addresses patient selection, vascular access, volume of blood withdrawn, choice of replacement fluid, blood storage and handling, and timing of reinfusion (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Intraoperative Cell Salvage</em></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing surgery in which substantial blood loss (blood loss of a volume great enough to induce anaemia that would require therapy) is anticipated, intraoperative cell salvage is recommended (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>Intraoperative cell salvage requires a local procedural guideline that should include patient selection, use of equipment and reinfusion. All staff operating cell salvage devices should receive appropriate training, to ensure knowledge of the technique and proficiency in using it (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Haemostasis Analysis</em></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of thromboelastography (TEG) should be considered (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Medications</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Aprotinin</span></p>
<p>There is evidence for the beneficial effect of intravenous aprotinin on incidence and volume of transfusion, blood loss, and the risk of reoperation for bleeding. However, the drug has been withdrawn due to concerns that it is less safe than alternative therapies<sup>a</sup> (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>

</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Tranexamic Acid</span></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of intravenous tranexamic acid is recommended (<strong>Grade A</strong>).</p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, if substantial blood loss (blood loss of a volume great enough to induce anaemia that would require therapy) is anticipated, the use of intravenous tranexamic acid is recommended (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>&amp;epsilon;-Aminocaproic Acid</span></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of intravenous &amp;epsilon;-aminocaproic acid is recommended (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>There is evidence for the beneficial effect of intravenous &amp;epsilon;-aminocaproic acid on reduction of perioperative blood loss and volume of transfusion (<strong>Grade C</strong>). However, the drug is not marketed in Australia and New Zealand (<strong>Practice Point</strong>). </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Desmopressin</span></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing surgery in which substantial blood loss (blood loss of a volume great enough to induce anaemia that would require therapy) is anticipated, the <em>routine</em> use of desmopressin is not supported, due to uncertainty about the risk of stroke and mortality (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Postoperative</strong></p>
<p><em>Postoperative Cell Salvage</em></p>
<p>In adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery or total knee arthroplasty, in whom significant postoperative blood loss is anticipated, postoperative cell salvage should be considered (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Appropriate Transfusion Practices</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Triggers for Blood Component Transfusion</strong></p>
<p>RBC transfusion should not be dictated by a haemoglobin 'trigger' alone, but should be based on assessment of the patient's clinical status. In the absence of acute myocardial or cerebrovascular ischaemia, postoperative transfusion may be inappropriate for patients with a haemoglobin level of &amp;gt;80 g/L (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Patients should not receive a transfusion when the haemoglobin level is &amp;ge;100 g/L. In postoperative patients with acute myocardial or cerebrovascular ischaemia and a haemoglobin level of 70&amp;ndash;100 g/L, transfusion of a single unit of RBC, followed by reassessment of clinical efficacy, is appropriate (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>In general, patients with a platelet count &amp;ge;50 &amp;times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L <em>or</em> an international normalised ratio (INR) &amp;le;2 can undergo invasive procedures without any serious bleeding; however, lower platelet counts and higher INRs may be tolerated (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p>Specialist guidelines or haematology advice should be sought for at-risk patients undergoing intracranial, intraocular and neuraxial procedures, and for patients with severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)</strong></p>
<p>The prophylactic use of FFP in cardiac surgery is not recommended (<strong>Grade B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Platelets</strong></p>
<p>The prophylactic use of platelets after cardiac surgery is not supported (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recombinant Activated Factor VII (rFVIIa)</strong></p>
<p>The prophylactic or routine therapeutic use of rFVIIa is not recommended because concerns remain about its safety profile, particularly in relation to thrombotic adverse events (<strong>Grade C</strong>).</p>
<p>The administration of rFVIIa may be considered in the perioperative patient with life-threatening haemorrhage after conventional measures, including surgical haemostasis, use of antifibrinolytics and appropriate blood component therapy have failed (<strong>Practice Point</strong>).</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Definitions of these study designs are provided on pages 7-8, <em>How to use the evidence: assessment and application of scientific evidence</em> (NHMRC, 2000).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>If it is possible and ethical to determine a causal relationship using experimental evidence, then the 'intervention' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised. If it is only possible or ethical to determine a causal relationship using observational evidence (e.g., groups cannot be allocated to a potential harmful exposure, such as nuclear radiation), then the 'aetiology' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup>A systematic review will only be assigned a level of evidence as high as the studies it contains, except where those studies contain Level II evidence. Systematic reviews of Level II evidence provide more data than the individual studies, and any meta-analyses will increase the precision of the overall results, reducing the likelihood that the results are affected by chance. Systematic reviews of lower level evidence present results of likely poor internal validity and thus are rated on the likelihood that the results have been affected by bias, rather than whether the systematic review itself is of good quality. Systematic review quality should be assessed separately. A systematic review should consist of at least two studies. In systematic reviews that include different study designs, the overall level of evidence should relate to each individual outcome or result, as different studies (and study designs) might contribute to each different outcome.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>d</sup>At study inception, the cohort is either non-diseased or all at the same stage of the disease. A randomised controlled trial with persons either non-diseased or at the same stage of the disease in both arms of the trial would also meet the criterion for this level of evidence.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>e</sup>All or none of the people with the risk factor(s) experience the outcome; and the data arises from an unselected or representative case series which provides an unbiased representation of the prognostic effect. For example, no smallpox develops in the absence of the specific virus; and clear proof of the causal link has come from the disappearance of smallpox after large-scale vaccination.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>f</sup>This also includes controlled before-and-after (pre-test/post-test) studies, as well as indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>g</sup>Comparing single arm studies, i.e., case series from two studies. This would also include unadjusted indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C, without statistical adjustment for B).</p>

Three main strategies were used to identify potentially relevant literature: electronic database searching, manual searching and use of literature recommended by expert members of the Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG).</p>
<p>The primary databases searched were EMBASE, Medline, the Cochrane Library Database and PreMedline. Additional searches were conducted of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Australasian Medical Index. The electronic searches included articles published after 1966. Literature retrievals were limited by the holdings of the databases accessed. Publication cut-off points varied from 29 April 2009 to 30 June 2009 (see Table D.1 in the original guideline document). Any future searches undertaken to revise, reuse or update these searches should take 1 April 2009 as the start date, to ensure complete coverage of the date range.</p>
<p>Following a review of the search results by the CRG in November 2009, the terms for some searches (specific question 2 and generic question 6) were revised to ensure inclusion of patients undergoing invasive procedures and minimally invasive surgical procedures. Table D.1 in the original guideline document shows the dates on which the revised searches were conducted. The cut-off date for these searches was 30 June 2009, to better align with previous cut-off dates.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were determined from the PICO, PPO or PRO criteria that formed the basis of the systematically reviewed research questions. Non-English publications were excluded.</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Definitions of these study designs are provided on pages 7-8, <em>How to use the evidence: assessment and application of scientific evidence</em> (NHMRC, 2000).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>If it is possible and ethical to determine a causal relationship using experimental evidence, then the 'intervention' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised. If it is only possible or ethical to determine a causal relationship using observational evidence (e.g., groups cannot be allocated to a potential harmful exposure, such as nuclear radiation), then the 'aetiology' hierarchy of evidence should be utilised.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup>A systematic review will only be assigned a level of evidence as high as the studies it contains, except where those studies contain Level II evidence. Systematic reviews of Level II evidence provide more data than the individual studies, and any meta-analyses will increase the precision of the overall results, reducing the likelihood that the results are affected by chance. Systematic reviews of lower level evidence present results of likely poor internal validity and thus are rated on the likelihood that the results have been affected by bias, rather than whether the systematic review itself is of good quality. Systematic review quality should be assessed separately. A systematic review should consist of at least two studies. In systematic reviews that include different study designs, the overall level of evidence should relate to each individual outcome or result, as different studies (and study designs) might contribute to each different outcome.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>d</sup>At study inception, the cohort is either non-diseased or all at the same stage of the disease. A randomised controlled trial with persons either non-diseased or at the same stage of the disease in both arms of the trial would also meet the criterion for this level of evidence.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>e</sup>All or none of the people with the risk factor(s) experience the outcome; and the data arises from an unselected or representative case series which provides an unbiased representation of the prognostic effect. For example, no smallpox develops in the absence of the specific virus; and clear proof of the causal link has come from the disappearance of smallpox after large-scale vaccination.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>f</sup>This also includes controlled before-and-after (pre-test/post-test) studies, as well as indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>g</sup>Comparing single arm studies, i.e., case series from two studies. This would also include unadjusted indirect comparisons (i.e., utilise A vs. B and B vs. C to determine A vs. C, without statistical adjustment for B).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Systematic reviews were undertaken to attempt to answer the questions specific to perioperative transfusion, and the generic questions relevant to all six modules of the Patient Blood Management Guidelines. The systematic review questions are listed in Box 2.1 in the original guideline document. Refer to the Technical Reports (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for details concerning the systematic review process and all evidence summary tables.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification and Assessment of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Studies identified for inclusion from the literature search were classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) levels of evidence hierarchy (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). To ensure that modules were based on the best available evidence, studies of higher levels of evidence (Levels I or II) were included in preference to those presenting lower levels of evidence (Levels III or IV). This was to minimise the potential for bias in the evidence base for each systematically reviewed question. However, lower level studies were reviewed where evidence was not available in higher level studies for any of the primary outcomes.</p>
<p>Studies identified from the systematic literature review were assessed according to NHMRC dimensions of evidence (see Table 2.4.2 in Technical Report Volume 1a). There are three main domains: strength of the evidence, size of the effect, and relevance of the evidence. The first domain was derived directly from the literature identified for a particular intervention, aetiology or prognostic study. The other two domains were determined in consultation with the Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) as part of the study assessment process during the review of the evidence considered for module development. An aspect of the strength of the evidence domain is the level of evidence of the study, which was determined as described above using the NHMRC levels of evidence hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the criteria presented in Appendix 3 of Technical Report Volume 1a. Quality assessment criteria varied according to whether included studies were systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies or case&amp;ndash;control studies. No weighting of quality criteria was applied, but studies that met all criteria, or all but one, were considered good quality with a low risk of bias. Quality assessments of included studies for all systematically reviewed research questions are presented in Appendix E of Technical Report Volume 2a.</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Data and information were extracted into evidence summary tables according to the inclusion criteria (population, intervention, comparator, outcome [PICO], population, risk, outcome [PRO] or population, predictor, outcome [PPO]). Evidence summary tables were based on NHMRC requirements for externally developed guidelines. Extracted data and information included general study details (citation, study design, evidence level, country and setting), characteristics of study participants, details of interventions and comparators, details of internal (e.g., allocation and blinding) and external (applicability and generalisability) study validity; and results for outcomes specified in the inclusion criteria. Where relevant studies were identified, extracted data and information were used to construct study characteristics and results tables of included evidence for each systematically reviewed research question.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of the Body of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The body of evidence for each module recommendation was graded in accordance with the NHMRC framework for developing evidence-based recommendations. Assessment of the body of evidence considers the dimensions of evidence of studies relevant to that recommendation. The NHMRC developed an evidence statement form to be used with each clinical research question considered in guidelines development (see Appendix 3 of Technical Report Volume 1a). Before the evidence statement form was completed, included studies were critically appraised and relevant data were summarised, as described. This information was required to formulate each recommendation and determine the overall grade of the body of evidence supporting each recommendation.</p>
<p>The key findings from included studies were summarised as evidence statements for each systematically reviewed research question. Where required, separate evidence statements were developed for different patient populations and outcomes. CRG input helped ensure that the size of effects and relevance of evidence were considered when developing evidence statements. Where no evidence or insufficient relevant evidence was identified, this was explained in the evidence statement.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) developed recommendations where sufficient evidence was available from the systematic review of the literature. The recommendations have been carefully worded to reflect the strength of the body of evidence.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Governance Structure</span></strong></p>
<p>A multilevel management framework was established by the NBA to coordinate the development of the new patient blood management guidelines. The management framework (illustrated in Appendix A of the original guideline document) consists of:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A Steering Committee, responsible for the overall development and governance of the entire project </li>
    <li>An Expert Working Group (EWG), responsible for clinical oversight and integration of the six modules </li>
    <li>Clinical/Consumer Reference Groups (CRGs &amp;ndash; one for each of the six modules), with membership including representation from relevant colleges, societies and consumer groups, to provide expert knowledge and input </li>
    <li>Systematic reviewers and a technical writer, contracted by the NBA to review the literature and develop a draft of each module </li>
    <li>Guidelines Assessment Register (GAR) consultants, to provide advice and mentoring to the systematic reviewers, technical writer, EWG and CRGs; and to ensure that the development process and the guidelines produced comply with National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>The NBA provided the secretariat, project funding and project management. The NBA Web site includes a list of colleges and societies that have endorsed these guidelines. Appendix A in the original guideline document lists the membership of the bodies involved in governance of the guidelines. Details of how the guidelines will be implemented and updated are provided in Chapter 6 of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Formulation of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of the NHMRC Evidence Statement Form</strong></p>
<p><em>Step 3: Formulation of a Recommendation Based on the Body of Evidence</em></p>
<p>Step 3 involved formulating the wording of the recommendation. This wording was intended to reflect the strength of the body evidence; that is, where the evidence base was regarded as poor or unreliable, words such as 'must' or 'should' were not used. The wording of recommendations was developed in conjunction with the CRG during meetings to review the evidence base for research questions.</p>
<p><em>Step 4: Determination of the Grade for the Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The overall grade for each recommendation was determined from a summary of the rating for each component of the body of evidence (outlined in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Definitions of the NHMRC grades of recommendations are presented in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field. In accordance with the NHMRC framework, recommendations were not graded A or B unless the evidence base and consistency of evidence were both rated A or B unless only one study was included and consistency was rated 'N/A'. In this situation the quality, size and strength of the evidence base was relied upon to grade the recommendation. The grading of recommendations was determined in conjunction with the CRG.</p>
<p>Developed recommendations were entered into the NHMRC evidence statement forms to accompany the corresponding evidence statement matrix, along with the overall grade determined in this step (see Appendix D of Technical Report Volume 2a [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p><strong>Practice Points</strong></p>
<p>Practice points were developed by the CRG through a facilitated group discussion (see Appendix 4 in Technical Report Volume 1a [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Where the underpinning evidence would have led to a grade D evidence-based recommendation </li>
    <li>Where the CRG developed evidence-based recommendations graded C and above, but considered that additional information was required to guide clinical practice. Wherever possible, this guidance was sourced from other evidence-based guidelines assessed to be of high quality </li>
    <li>Where insufficient evidence was identified to support the development of an evidence-based recommendation </li>

<p>Public consultation was conducted for eight weeks, from 7 February 2011, during which time the draft module was available on the National Blood Authority (NBA) Web site. Notification was posted in <em>The Australian</em> national newspaper, and the NBA invited a range of stakeholders, committees, working groups and interested people to provide submissions.</p>
<p>Twenty-five submissions were received. The Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) met on 9-10 May and 12-13 July to consider all responses to the public consultation submissions and, where necessary, revise this module in accordance with the submissions. Many changes were made to the module, to address comments and concerns raised in submissions, and to improve clarity.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Finalising the Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The final drafts of the module and technical reports were reviewed by a guidelines development expert (formerly a Guidelines Assessment Registrar [GAR] consultant) to assess compliance with National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) requirements for externally developed guidelines. The module was then reviewed by an Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II expert to assess it against international quality standards. The module and accompanying documents were then sent to the NHMRC for methodological and independent peer review on 4 August 2011.</p>
<p>The module was further refined in response to the reviewer's recommendations. Approval from the NHMRC was received on 15 November 2011.</p></div>"/>

<p>The risk of transmission of infectious diseases has reduced significantly in recent years through improved manufacturing and laboratory processes. Nevertheless, there is still a small potential for transfusion of an unrecognised infectious agent.</p>
<p>Despite improvements in systems management, there remains a risk of transfusion-related harm due to administrative error. Such an error has the potential to result in acute haemolytic reaction from ABO incompatibility, which may be fatal.</p>
<p>Of the recognised adverse events associated with transfusion, the most common is transfusion-associated circulatory overload, which is reported in up to 1% of patients receiving transfusions.</p>
<p>The clinical decision to undertake transfusion therapy should only be made after full consideration of the risks and benefits. Table B.1 in the original guideline document summarises the risks and benefits; Table B.2 puts the risks into perspective; and Table B.3 presents the Calman chart (United Kingdom risk per one year), which may be useful to clinicians for explaining risks to patients.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The extent to which the guidelines influence changes in clinical practice and health outcomes </li>
    <li>What factors (if any) contribute to noncompliance with the guidelines </li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the evaluation will be used to inform future review of the guidelines. Economic issues were considered when formulating the evidence-based recommendations, and the recommendations will have cost implications. Savings are expected to be derived from reduced use of product and an associated reduction in hospital and laboratory costs. However, the Clinical/Consumer Reference Group (CRG) anticipates that additional costs will be incurred due to the system re-design and training associated with wider implementation of preoperative anaemia assessment and treatment, improved collection and use of data to inform practice, introduction of new surgical techniques and wider uptake of other technologies such as cell salvage. While economic models have indicated a net benefit from the implementation of patient blood management practices, no economic model has been developed for the Australian setting. The NBA, together with the Jurisdictional Blood Committee (JBC) and key stakeholders, is developing a program to facilitate uptake of the guidelines that take into account the challenges raised in Section 5.2 of the original guideline document. A number of initiatives have commenced, including initial investment in the development of a patient blood management toolkit that will help jurisdictions and individual hospitals to implement patient blood management practices. Patient blood management content has been included in nationally available education programs such as the BloodSafe eLearning Program and the Post Graduate Certificate in Transfusion Practice that is available through the University of Melbourne. Also under development is a national data dictionary that will facilitate data linkage and thus support jurisdictional evaluation of appropriate use of red cells.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Implementation of Guidelines Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The National Health and Medical Research Council (HMRC) framework directs that guidelines implementation should be considered at the same time that recommendations are formulated. The NHMRC evidence statement form contains questions related to the implementation of each module (see Appendix 3 in Technical Report Volume 1a [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). These are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Will this recommendation result in changes in usual care? </li>
    <li>Are there any resource implications associated with implementing this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Will the implementation of this recommendation require changes in the way care is currently organised? </li>
    <li>Is the guidelines development group aware of any barriers to the implementation of this recommendation? </li>
</ul>
<p>This section of the NHMRC evidence statement form was completed in consultation with the CRG when each recommendation was formulated and graded. Implementation issues are recorded in the NHMRC evidence statement forms presented in Appendix D of Technical Report Volume 2a (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>
