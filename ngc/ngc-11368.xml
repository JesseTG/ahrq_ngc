	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>In adults with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) with no contraindications for &amp;beta;-blockers, the authors conditionally recommend the use of in-hospital &amp;beta;-blockers provided that hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mm Hg) and symptomatic bradycardia (defined as heart rate &amp;lt;50 with symptoms) are avoided. The evidence is limited about whether these thresholds are too restrictive or irrelevant, but it would be cavalier to employ permissive hypotensive strategies in the face of known TBI outside of clinical trials. The majority of cohort studies included patients with Head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) of 4 to 5. Therefore, the authors limit the recommendation to patients with severe TBI who are admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) where monitoring for and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events is feasible. Although this recommendation is based on a synthesis of very low-quality studies, most of these studies demonstrate a consistent effect and do not report significant cardiopulmonary harm from administration of &amp;beta;-blockers. However, the authors cannot provide a recommendation on when to initiate &amp;beta;-blockers, which &amp;beta;-blockers to use, or how to titrate &amp;beta;-blockers to a specific heart rate, blood pressure, and/or length of time.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>The Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) question was structured as follows:</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>Population: in adults with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI), <br />
Intervention: in-hospital &amp;beta;-blockers should be used, <br />
Comparator: in-hospital &amp;beta;-blockers should not be used, <br />
Outcome: to improve mortality, functional outcomes, quality of life outcomes, without worsening cardiopulmonary morbidity (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and/or congestive heart failure).</p>
<p><strong>Study Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>The protocol was registered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (Registration Number: CRD42016048547). This study is transparently built upon a previously published systematic review, using similar methods and eligibility criteria. The authors searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasirandomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, and cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) comparing TBI patients who received in-hospital &amp;beta;-blockers after injury to those who did not. They excluded case reports, letters to the editor, articles in the lay press, abstracts, and review articles. RCTs and observational studies were analyzed separately, as a direct comparison between the estimates of observational studies and RCTs could be misleading.</p>
<p><strong>Population</strong></p>
<p>The authors included studies that involved adult patients aged &amp;ge;16 years with acute TBI of any severity requiring hospital admission.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions and Comparators</strong></p>
<p>All forms of in-hospital &amp;beta;-blockers were included, provided they were given during the hospital stay and continued for any duration of time. The comparison group could have received either placebo or no treatment. The authors included any dose of &amp;beta;-blockers and planned sensitivity analyses if different dose and regimens were utilized.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, outcomes were chosen by the team and rated in importance from 1 to 9, with scores of 7 to 9 representing critical outcomes. The critical outcomes were in-hospital mortality, functional recovery, and quality of life with scores of 9, 8, and 7 respectively. The important (i.e., secondary) outcomes are all related to cardiopulmonary morbidity. The authors broadly accepted functional outcome, as assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) scale, Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE) scale, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), or Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Similarly, they allowed quality of life metrics that used any standardized scale. Secondary outcomes consisted of common cardiopulmonary adverse effects of &amp;beta;-blockers, such as cardiac biomarker elevation, arrhythmia, clinically significant hypotension (i.e., systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mm Hg, which required fluid resuscitation, discontinuation of the study drug, and/or an inotropic agent), clinically significant bradycardia (i.e., bradycardia requiring a temporary pacemaker, a sympathomimetic agent, atropine, or discontinuation of the study drug), bronchospasm, and/or congestive heart failure.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sources</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the original systematic review and meta-analysis on this topic, the authors searched MEDLINE (from January 1, 1950), EMBASE (from January 1, 1980), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years). The search was not restricted by date, language, or publication status. The search was last updated on May 9, 2016. The search strategy was based on the MEDLINE search strategy (see the Supplementary Material [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]), and was modified as necessary for the other databases. In addition, they searched the reference lists of relevant articles.</p></div>"/>

<p>Two authors independently examined all of the abstracts of the studies identified by the search and determined the eligibility of each study. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus and including a third author. They scanned the titles and abstracts of every record retrieved to determine which of the studies should be assessed further. If it was clear from the title and abstract that the article was irrelevant, the article was rejected. The full manuscripts of the remaining articles were then retrieved.</p>
<p>Data abstraction forms were created and used to collect the relevant data from the included studies. Two authors independently extracted data on patients, methods, interventions (or exposures in the cohort studies), outcomes and results.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Risk of Bias Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each included study. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion and consensus. Each included study was classified as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or a cohort study, and the risk of bias was assessed differently for each type of study. For RCTs, they used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool of assessing risk of bias according to the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcomes, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and baseline imbalances. For cohort studies, selection of the exposed and unexposed cohorts, the comparability of the cohorts, the assessment of the outcomes, and the adequacy of follow-up were addressed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (see the Supplementary Material, Figure 1 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The scale was modified to include important traumatic brain injury (TBI) prognostic variables (age, pupillary reactivity and Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] Score) under the comparability category, and therefore allowed the reviewers to optimize the applicability of the scale to the TBI cohort studies. Selection for these prognostic variables was based on the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) Core prognostic model. When considering comparability in the modified NOS, the authors assessed whether these important variables were adjusted for in a multivariate analysis (e.g., age, GCS score, pupillary reaction).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quantitative Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors calculated the odds ratio (OR) to measure the treatment effect for the dichotomous outcomes with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The generic inverse variance method was used when the included study reported only the odds ratio (OR) and its standard error. Clinical heterogeneity across the studies was assessed by examining the details of the subjects, the baseline data, and the interventions and the outcomes to determine whether the studies were sufficiently similar. Statistical heterogeneity was determined using the I2 statistic and the Chi-square test. They used a funnel plot to assess for reporting bias (see Supplementary Material, Figure 2).</p>
<p>The authors used the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) to conduct a quantitative analysis. They performed a meta-analysis using a random-effect model because there was a suggestion statistical heterogeneity between the studies, although there was no evidence of clinical heterogeneity.</p></div>"/>
