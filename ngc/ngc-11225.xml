	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis of Hypopituitarism</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Central Adrenal Insufficiency</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests measuring serum cortisol levels at 8-9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central adrenal insufficiency (AI). (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that a cortisol level &amp;lt;3 &amp;micro;g/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level &amp;gt;15 &amp;micro;g/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 &amp;micro;g/dL to diagnose AI. Peak cortisol levels &amp;lt;18.1 &amp;micro;g/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis at least 18-24 hours after the last hydrocortisone (HC) dose or longer for synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs). (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Central Hypothyroidism</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measuring serum free thyroxine (T4) (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to evaluate central hypothyroidism (CH). An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, the Task Force suggests starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Growth Hormone (GH) Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In patients with suspected GH deficiency (GHD), the Task Force recommends GH stimulation testing. Single GH measurements are not helpful. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends using appropriately controlled body mass index (BMI) cutoffs to assess peak GH values. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against biochemical testing for GHD in patients with clear-cut features of GHD and three other documented pituitary hormone deficits. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Central Hypogonadism in Males</strong></p>
<p>In males with suspected hypogonadism, the Task Force recommends measuring serum testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) to diagnose central hypogonadism. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians perform hormonal testing for central hypogonadism in males in the absence of acute/subacute illness and before 10 AM (after overnight fast) combined with serum prolactin (PRL). (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Central Hypogonadism in Females</strong></p>
<p>In the presence of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, the Task Force recommends measuring serum estradiol (E2), FSH, and LH. Clinicians should exclude other causes of menstrual irregularities related to impaired ovulation (hyperprolactinemia, hyperandrogenism, and thyroid disease), particularly if no other pituitary hormone deficits are present. In cases of amenorrhea, clinicians should also exclude pregnancy. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against dynamic testing with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which offers no useful diagnostic information. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that in postmenopausal women, the absence of high serum FSH and LH is sufficient for a diagnosis of gonadotrope dysfunction (provided the patient is not on hormonal replacement therapy [HRT]). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Central Diabetes Insipidus</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends simultaneously measuring serum and urine osmolarity in patients with polyuria (more than 50 mL/kg of body weight/24 hours, 3.5 L/day in a 70-kg person). In the presence of high serum osmolarity (&amp;gt;295 mOsmol/L), urine osmolarity should reach approximately 600 mOsmol/L (urine osmolality/plasma osmolality ratio should be &amp;le;2), whereas urine dipstick should be negative for glucose.

<p><strong>Hormonal Replacement in Panhypopituitarism</strong></p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoid Replacement</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends using HC, usually 15&amp;ndash;20 mg total daily dose in single or divided doses. Patients using divided doses should take the highest dose in the morning at awakening and the second in the afternoon (two-dose regime) or the second and third at lunch and late afternoon, respectively (three-dose regime). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests using longer-acting GCs in selected cases (e.g., nonavailability, poor compliance, convenience). (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians teach all patients with AI regarding stress-dose and emergency GC administration and instruct them to obtain an emergency card/bracelet/necklace regarding AI and an emergency kit containing injectable high-dose GC (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against using fludrocortisone in patients with secondary AI. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Adrenal Crisis</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians treat patients with suspected adrenal crisis (AC) due to secondary AI with an immediate parenteral injection of 50&amp;ndash;100 mg HC. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Thyroid Hormone Replacement</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends levothyroxine (L-T4) in doses sufficient to achieve serum fT4 levels in the mid to upper half of the reference range. Appropriate L-T4 doses in CH average 1.6 &amp;micro;g/kg/day, with dose adjustments based on clinical context, age, and fT4 levels. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against treating CH with levotriiodothyronine (L-T3), thyroid extracts, or other formulations of thyroid hormones. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against using serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CH. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Testosterone Replacement</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests T replacement for adult males with central hypogonadism and no contraindications in order to prevent anemia related to T deficiency; reduce fat mass; and improve bone mineral density (BMD), libido, sexual function, energy levels, sense of well-being, and muscle mass and strength. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Estrogen Replacement in Premenopausal Women</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends gonadal hormone treatment in premenopausal women with central hypogonadism, provided there are no contraindications. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>GH Replacement Therapy</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends offering GH replacement to those patients with proven GHD and no contraindications. The Task Force recommends a starting dose of 0.2&amp;ndash;0.4 mg/d for patients younger than 60 years and 0.1&amp;ndash;0.2 mg/d for patients older than 60 years. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends titrating GH doses and maintaining insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels below the upper limit of normal and reducing the dose if side effects manifest. (<strong>1|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against administering GH to elderly adults with age-adjusted low IGF-1 levels and no history of pituitary or hypothalamic disease. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against using GH to enhance athletic performance because this practice is illegal in the United States, has poor scientific or ethical justification, and does not have substantiated efficacy. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Diabetes Insipidus</em></p>
<p>When administering desmopressin (DDAVP) in diabetes insipidus (DI), the Task Force suggests individualized therapeutic schedules. Although clinicians should offer therapy to all patients, some patients with partial DI may not be bothered by polyuria and may prefer no treatment. To reduce the risk of hyponatremia, the Task Force recommends that clinicians educate all patients receiving DDAVP about the risk of overdosing. Periodically (at least weekly), patients should experience a phase of polyuria during which the effect of the medication has obviously worn off. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p>In postpituitary surgery DI, the Task Force suggests that clinicians should make at least one attempt to discontinue DDAVP during the weeks/months after surgery to determine whether posterior pituitary function has recovered. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p>In cases of adipsic DI, the Task Force suggests careful DDAVP and fluid intake titration that includes frequent weighing and serum sodium level monitoring. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that all patients with DI wear an emergency bracelet or necklace to inform clinicians of the patient's health problem if incapacitated. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Interactions between Replacement Hormones</strong></p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoids and GH</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests testing HPA axis functionality before and after starting GH replacement in patients who are not receiving GC replacement and who have demonstrated apparently normal pituitary-adrenal function. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoids and Thyroid Hormone</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests evaluating patients with CH for AI before starting L-T4 therapy. If this is not feasible, clinicians should prescribe empiric GC therapy in patients with CH who are starting L-T4 therapy until there is a definitive evaluation for AI. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoids and Estrogen</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that when clinicians assess adrenal reserve or the adequacy of HC replacement, they take into consideration that total serum cortisol level can be elevated due to the effects of estrogen on corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>GH and Thyroid Hormones</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians monitor euthyroid patients with GHD who begin GH therapy for the risk of developing CH, and if fT4 levels decrease below the reference range, these patients should begin L-T4 therapy. CH patients with GHD who are already receiving L-T4 may require increased L-T4 doses when they begin GH therapy to maintain fT4 levels within target ranges. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests clinicians treat CH before performing GH stimulation testing because CH may impair the accurate diagnosis of GHD. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Estrogen and Thyroid Hormones</em></p>
<p>In patients with CH requiring changes in estrogen therapy, the Task Force recommends monitoring fT4 levels and adjusting L-T4 doses to maintain fT4 levels within target ranges. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>GH and Estrogen</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that women on oral estrogen replacement receive higher GH doses compared with eugonadal females or males. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoids and Diabetes Insipidus</em></p>
<p>Because AI may mask the presence of partial DI, the Task Force suggests monitoring for the development of DI after starting GC replacement. Conversely, patients with improved DI without an AI diagnosis should undergo AI testing. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Hormonal Over-Replacement in Hypopituitarism</strong></p>
<p><em>Bone Disease</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should individually assess GC replacement and avoid over-replacement to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. The Task Force suggests low-dose HC replacement because this approach might be associated with increased bone formation and a positive bone-remodeling balance. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>In men with hypopituitarism over-replaced with GC and at risk for fractures, the Task Force suggests vertebral fracture assessment (baseline plain spinal x-rays or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) to identify patients with unsuspected vertebral fractures. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests clinicians monitor L-T4 replacement, as recommended in previous sections, and avoid over-replacement to reduce the risk of fractures. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular Risks in Patients with Hypopituitarism on Replacement Therapy</strong></p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoid Over-Replacement</em></p>
<p>In patients with central AI, the Task Force recommends using the lowest tolerable dose of HC replacement to potentially decrease the risks of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Thyroid Replacement</em></p>
<p>To avoid the possible long-term cardiovascular risks of insufficient or excess thyroid hormone treatment, clinicians should adjust L-T4 doses to avoid low or elevated fT4 levels in CH. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Special Circumstances</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cushing's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends GC replacement until full HPA axis recovery after surgically resecting adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumors. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>After curative surgery for Cushing's disease, the Task Force recommends retesting thyroid and GH axes before starting replacement treatment. (<strong>1|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Prolactinomas</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends reassessing all pituitary axes in patients with macroprolactinoma and central hypogonadism who have had successful dopamine agonist treatments. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>GH Replacement in Cured Acromegaly after Surgery and/or Radiation</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests low-dose GH replacement in patients with cured acromegaly and documented GHD in the absence of known contraindications. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Perioperative Management of Hypopituitarism</strong></p>
<p><em>Pituitary Surgery</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends using stress doses of steroids in AI before surgery and tapered doses after surgery before repeating testing. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with normal preoperative adrenal function, the Task Force suggests an individualized clinical approach for postoperative GC administration until the HPA axis can be evaluated. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>With preoperative CH, the Task Force recommends using L-T4 therapy before nonemergency surgery and throughout the perioperative period. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>With intact preoperative thyroid function, the Task Force recommends measuring fT4 levels 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively to assess for CH. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that initial therapy for DI utilizes short-acting subcutaneous (sc) aqueous antidiuretic hormone (ADH), allowing for safer use in the vast majority of cases in whom DI resolves spontaneously. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force does not suggest prescheduled DDAVP dosages in the first week postsurgery because of the risk of hyponatremia after transient DI resolves and the risk of syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion that may occur 7 to 10 days after surgery. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests oral or intranasal DDAVP after discharge, with clear instructions that patients should only use the medication if significant polyuria occurs. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests retesting all pituitary axes starting at 6 weeks after pituitary surgery and then periodically to monitor the development or resolution of pituitary deficiencies. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Non-Pituitary Surgery</em></p>
<p>On the day of surgery, the Task Force recommends adjusting GC doses according to the severity of illness and magnitude of the stressor. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>In cases of minor to moderate surgical stress, the Task Force suggests 25&amp;ndash;75 mg HC per 24 hours (usually for 1&amp;ndash;2 days). (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>In cases of major surgical stress, the Task Force suggests a 100-mg HC per intravenous (iv) injection followed by a continuous iv infusion of 200 mg HC per 24 hours (alternatively 50 mg every 6 hours iv or intramuscular [im]). (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Management of Hypopituitarism in Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p><em>Glucocorticoids</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests using HC as the preferred GC in pregnancy and increasing the dose based on the individual clinical course; higher doses may be required, in particular during the third trimester. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that pregnant patients with central AI be closely monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of GC over- and under-replacement (e.g., normal weight gain, fatigue, postural hypotension or hypertension, hyperglycemia). (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against using dexamethasone in pregnancy because it is not inactivated in the placenta. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends HC stress dosing during the active phase of labor, similar to that used in major surgical stress. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Thyroid</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians monitor fT4 or total T4 levels every 4 to 6 weeks for women with CH who become pregnant, and that these women may require increased L-T4 doses to maintain levels within target ranges for pregnancy. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Desmopressin</em></p>
<p>In pregnant women with pre-existing DI, the Task Force suggests continuing DDAVP during pregnancy and adjusting doses if required. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Growth Hormone</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests discontinuing GH replacement during pregnancy because there is no clear evidence yet for efficacy or safety, and the placenta produces GH. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Management of Hypopituitarism in Pituitary Apoplexy</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends testing for acute pituitary insufficiency in all patients with pituitary apoplexy. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>Because acute AI is a major cause of mortality, the Task Force recommends GC therapy until a laboratory diagnosis is established and the patient maintains normal pituitary function. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians monitor pituitary axes in pituitary apoplexy patients treated with either surgical decompression or conservative management because hypopituitarism may develop over time. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Hypopituitarism in Patients Receiving Antiepileptic Medications</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests clinicians educate AI patients that are taking nondexamethasone GCs and who start enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) about the early signs and symptoms of AI. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with AI on dexamethasone, the Task Force suggests increasing dexamethasone replacement doses if enzyme-induced AEDs are coadministered. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>In CH patients receiving L-T4, the Task Force recommends checking fT4 at least 6 weeks after starting an AED and increasing L-T4 doses if fT4 levels decrease below the target range. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>In women who have started estrogen replacement, the Task Force suggests evaluating AED levels and adjusting AED doses as required. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests monitoring DDAVP doses and making further adjustments as needed in patients who are started on AEDs. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>: In this guideline, the Task Force made several statements to emphasize the importance of shared decision making, general preventive care measures, and basic principles of hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism. The Task Force labeled these as &quot;Ungraded Good Practice Statement.&quot; Direct evidence for these statements was either unavailable or not systematically appraised; therefore, the Task Force considers these statements out of the scope of this guideline. The intention of these statements is to draw attention to and remind providers of these principles; one should not consider these statements as graded recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The American Association for Clinical Chemistry, the Pituitary Society, and the European Society of Endocrinology co-sponsored this guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force developed this evidence-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Process</span></strong></p>
<p>One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, the Pituitary Society, and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>: In this guideline, the Task Force made several statements to emphasize the importance of shared decision making, general preventive care measures, and basic principles of hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism. The Task Force labeled these as &quot;Ungraded Good Practice Statement.&quot; Direct evidence for these statements was either unavailable or not systematically appraised; therefore, the Task Force considers these statements out of the scope of this guideline. The intention of these statements is to draw attention to and remind providers of these principles; one should not consider these statements as graded recommendations.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Side effects of growth hormone (GH) replacement at the recommended doses manifest in about 20% of patients and are usually reversible by lowering the GH dose. Reported side effects include fluid retention, arthralgias, myalgias, paresthesias, carpal tunnel syndrome, sleep apnea, sleep disturbances, and dyspnea. If replacement doses are too high, insulin resistance with diabetes may occur. Although the development of new cancers and new-onset diabetes is of concern, the safety profile for GH treatment (using appropriate replacement doses) appears favorable in long-term surveillance studies. </li>
    <li>Over-replacement with glucocorticoid (GC) in male patients with pituitary dysfunction can increase vertebral fracture risk, despite the restoration of gonadal status. Levothyroxine (L-T4) over-replacement in patients with primary hypothyroidism may increase bone turnover and increase the fracture risk, especially in postmenopausal women. Similarly, in a cautionary study in 74 adult central hypothyroidism (CH) patients treated with 1.1 &amp;micro;g/kg/d L-T4, higher daily L-T4 doses were associated with a higher prevalence of vertebral fractures (assessed by lateral spine x-rays). </li>
    <li>In a cross-sectional study, hydrocortisone (HC) doses above 30 mg/day were associated with adverse health status by validated self-assessment questionnaires. </li>
    <li>Higher GC replacement doses in patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency were associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality; the greatest risk was in patients receiving daily HC doses higher or equal to 30 mg. </li>
    <li>Some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) enhance hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzyme activity (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate), accelerating the hepatic metabolism of hormonal preparations and decreasing serum concentrations of relevant hormones. Effects depend on the type of GC. </li>
    <li>A recent publication reported that increased risk of vertebral fracture in hypopituitary patients receiving higher daily doses of L-T4 correlated with higher free thyroxine (fT4) levels. </li>
