	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

(<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>After performing a history, physical examination, and urinalysis, clinicians may use a combination of patient reported measures, uroflowmetry, and ultrasound post void residual assessment in the initial evaluation of suspected urethral stricture. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should use urethro-cystoscopy, retrograde urethrography, voiding cystourethrography, or ultrasound urethrography to make a diagnosis of urethral stricture. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians planning non-urgent intervention for a known stricture should determine the length and location of the urethral stricture. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons may utilize urethral endoscopic management (e.g., urethral dilation or direct visual internal urethrotomy [DVIU]) or immediate suprapubic cystostomy for urgent management of urethral stricture, such as discovery of systematic urinary retention or catheterization prior to another surgical procedure. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons may place a suprapubic (SP) cystostomy prior to definitive urethroplasty in patients dependent on an indwelling urethral catheter or intermittent self-dilation. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

    <li>Surgeons may perform either dilation or DVIU when performing endoscopic treatment of a urethral stricture. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons may safely remove the urethral catheter within 72 hours following uncomplicated dilation or DVIU. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients who are not candidates for urethroplasty, clinicians may recommend self-catheterization after DVIU to maintain urethral patency. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should offer urethroplasty, instead of repeated endoscopic management, for recurrent anterior urethral strictures following failed dilation or DVIU. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons who do not perform urethroplasty should offer patients referral to surgeons with expertise. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

    <li>Surgeons should offer urethroplasty to patients with recurrent meatal or fossa navicularis strictures. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should offer urethroplasty to patients with penile urethral strictures, given the expected high recurrence rates with endoscopic treatments. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should offer urethroplasty as the initial treatment for patients with long (&amp;ge;2 cm) bulbar urethral strictures, given the low success rate of DVIU or dilation. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons may reconstruct long multi-segment strictures with one stage or multi-stage techniques using oral mucosal grafts, penile fasciocutaneous flaps or a combination of these techniques. (<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons may offer perineal urethrostomy as a long-term treatment option to patients as an alternative to urethroplasty. (<strong><em>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should use oral mucosa as the first choice when using grafts for urethroplasty. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should not perform substitution urethroplasty with allograft, xenograft, or synthetic materials except under experimental protocols. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should not perform a single-stage tubularized graft urethroplasty. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should not use hair-bearing skin for substitution urethroplasty. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>

(<strong><em>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgeons should perform delayed urethroplasty instead of delayed endoscopic procedures after urethral obstruction/obliteration due to PFUI. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Definitive urethral reconstruction for PFUI should be planned only after major injuries stabilize and patients can be safely positioned for urethroplasty. (<strong><em>Expert</em></strong> <strong><em>Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

    <li>Clinicians may perform biopsy for suspected lichen sclerosus (LS), and must perform biopsy if urethral cancer is suspected. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In LS proven urethral stricture, surgeons should not use genital skin for reconstruction. (<strong><em>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Body of Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: Well-conducted and highly-generalizable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies with consistent findings</p>
<p><strong>Grade B</strong>: RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or moderately strong observational studies with consistent findings </p>
<p><strong>Grade C</strong>: RCTs with serious deficiencies of procedure, generalizability, or extremely small sample sizes or observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data</p>
<p class=&quot;note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: By definition, Grade A evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a high level of certainty, Grade B evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a moderate level of certainty, and Grade C evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a low level of certainty.</p>

<p>A systematic review was conducted to identify published articles relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of urethral stricture. Literature searches were performed on English-language publications using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from 1/1/1990 to 12/1/2015. Data from studies published after the literature search cut-off will be incorporated into the next version of this guideline. Preclinical studies (e.g., animal models), commentary, editorials, non-English language publications, and meeting abstracts were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were as follows: studies of females; studies of stricture prevention; patients with epispadias, congenital strictures, and duplicated urethra; trauma already covered under trauma guidelines including diagnosis and management of acute pelvic fracture urethral injury (PFUI) or disruption (PFUD); urethral cancer not related to stricture; or voiding symptoms not related to stricture. Studies with less than 10 patients were generally excluded from further evaluation and thus data extraction given the unreliability of the statistical estimates and conclusions that could be derived from them. In rare instances, studies with less than 10 patients or studies preceding the literature search date were included if no other evidence was identified. For certain key questions that had little or no evidence from comparative studies, case series with 50 or more patients were included. Review article references were checked to ensure inclusion of all possible relevant studies. Multiple reports on the same patient group were carefully examined to ensure inclusion of only non-redundant information. </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction/Abstraction</span></strong>
<p>Accepted articles were extracted separately by a team of four extractors (all contractors) using standard extraction forms. The methodologist developed the forms and trained the extractors. Given the size of the pool of eligible articles, independent double extraction was not possible for most of the articles. Instead, the methodologist reviewed the work of the other extractors and searched for inconsistencies and missing information in the extracted data.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Study Quality</span></strong></p>
<p>Conventional diagnostic cohort studies, diagnostic case‐control studies, or diagnostic case series that presented data on diagnostic test characteristics were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) 2 tool, which evaluates the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies. If one or two items were answered &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Unclear&quot; the study was rated as moderate quality. If more than two items were answered as &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Unclear&quot; the study was rated as low quality. Some studies addressing diagnostic questions did not present information on diagnostic test characteristics but still included data that was judged to be potentially useful for diagnostic purposes. These studies were designated as case series and were not formally evaluated with a study quality instrument; instead, they were labeled as low quality due to their study design. This approach was also used for case series evaluating treatment, prognosis, or indications for diagnostic evaluation or treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which had a comparison of interest were evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. If none or one of the six items was answered as &quot;Unclear&quot; the study was rated as high quality; if one item answered as &quot;No&quot; or two to three items answered as &quot;Unclear&quot; the study was considered to be of moderate quality. Two or more &quot;No&quot; answers or four or more &quot;Unclear&quot; answers and the study was considered to be of low quality. Cohort studies with a comparison of interest were evaluated with the Drug Effectiveness Review Project instrument. Three &quot;No&quot; answers or four &quot;Unclear&quot; answers on the internal validity section of this instrument would lead to a moderate quality rating, while five &quot;No&quot; answers or six &quot;Unclear&quot; answers would lead to a low quality rating.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Analyses</span></strong></p>
<p>A separate analysis was conducted for each of the 55 key questions for which at least one study met the inclusion criteria. For key questions with multiple included studies, heterogeneity in the types of data reported and the patient populations in each study precluded quantitative analyses. Instead, a narrative synthesis was used to summarize the evidence for each key question. The body of evidence for each key question was rated using the American Urological Association (AUA) system of A, B, or C (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>"/>

<p>For some clinical issues, particularly diagnosis, there was little or no evidence from which to construct evidence-based statements.

    <li>Erectile dysfunction, as measured by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) may occur transiently after urethroplasty with resolution of nearly all reported symptoms approximately six months postoperatively. Meta-analysis has demonstrated the risk of new onset erectile dysfunction following anterior urethroplasty to be ~1%. Type of urethroplasty, specifically anastomotic urethroplasty, as a causative risk factor for sexual dysfunction remains unclear. Erectile function following urethroplasty for pelvic fracture urethral injury (PFUI) does not appear to significantly change as a result of surgery. Erectile dysfunction in this cohort may be related to the initial pelvic trauma rather that the subsequent urethral reconstruction. </li>
    <li>Ejaculatory dysfunction manifested as pooling of semen, decreased ejaculatory force, ejaculatory discomfort, and decreased semen volume has been reported by up to 21% of men following bulbar urethroplasty. Urethroplasty technique may play a role in the occurrence of ejaculatory dysfunction but the exact etiology remains uncertain. Conversely, some patients, as measured by the Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ), will notice an improvement in ejaculatory function following bulbar urethroplasty, particularly those with pre-operative ejaculatory dysfunction related to obstruction caused by the stricture. Data on ejaculatory function in men undergoing penile urethroplasty or urethroplasty for PFUI is limited. </li>
    <li>The modestly invasive nature of retrograde urethrography reflects the potential risks, including patient discomfort, urinary tract infection (UTI), hematuria, and contrast extravasation. UTI is rare and contrast extravasation is very rare in expert hands. Exposure to the contrast puts the patient at risk for a contrast reaction, should there be an allergy. The risk is very low in the absence of inadvertent extravasation, and may be mitigated by pre-medication with oral corticosteroids and histamine blockers. </li>

    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses (&quot;off label&quot;) that are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not intended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
