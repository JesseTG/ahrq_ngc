	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: Recommendations are accompanied by suggested strategies for implementation in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What core communication skills and tasks apply at every visit, across the cancer continuum?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: Before each conversation, clinicians should review the patient's medical information, establish goals for the conversation, and anticipate the needs and responses of the patient and family (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: At the beginning of conversations with patients, clinicians should explore the patient's understanding of their disease and collaboratively set an agenda with the patient after inquiring what the patient and family wish to address and explaining what the clinician wishes to address (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: During patient visits, clinicians should engage in behaviors that actively foster trust, confidence in the clinician, and collaboration (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>: Clinicians should provide information that is timely and oriented to the patient's concerns and preferences for information. After providing information, clinicians should check for patient understanding and document important discussions in the medical record (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.5</em>: When patients display emotion through verbal or nonverbal behavior, clinicians should respond empathically (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when discussing goals of care and prognosis?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Clinicians should provide diagnostic and prognostic information that is tailored to the patient's needs and that provides hope and reassurance without misleading the patient (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: Clinicians should reassess a patient's goals, priorities, and desire for information whenever a significant change in the patient's care is being considered (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.3</em>: Clinicians should provide information in simple and direct terms (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.4</em>: When providing bad news, clinicians should take additional steps to address the needs and responses of patients (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when discussing treatment options (including best supportive care) and clinical trials?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: Before discussing specific treatment options with the patient, clinicians should clarify the goals of treatment (cure v prolongation of survival v improved quality of life) so that the patient understands likely outcomes and can relate the goals of treatment to their goals of care (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: When reviewing treatment options with patients, clinicians should provide information about the potential benefits and burdens of any treatment (proportionality) and check the patient's understanding of these benefits and burdens (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: Clinicians should discuss treatment options in a way that preserves patient hope, promotes autonomy, and facilitates understanding (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4</em>: Clinicians should make patients aware of all treatment options, including clinical trials and a sole focus on palliative care. When appropriate, clinicians should discuss the option of initiating palliative care simultaneously with other treatment modalities. If clinical trials are available, clinicians should start treatment discussions with standard treatments available off trial and then move to a discussion of applicable clinical trials if the patient is interested (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when discussing end-of-life care?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.1</em>: Clinicians should use an organized framework to guide the bidirectional communication about end-of-life care with patients and families (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.2</em>: Clinicians should initiate conversations about patients' end-of-life preferences early in the course of incurable illness and readdress this topic periodically based on clinical events or patient preferences (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.3</em>: Clinicians should explore how a patient's culture, religion, or spiritual belief system affects their end-of-life decision making or care preferences (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.4</em>: Clinicians should recognize and respond empathically to grief and loss among patients, families, and themselves. Clinicians should refer patients and families to psychosocial team members (e.g., social workers, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and clergy) when appropriate (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.5</em>: Clinicians should identify and suggest local resources to provide robust support to patients, families, and loved ones transitioning to end-of-life care (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use to facilitate family involvement in care?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: Clinicians should suggest family and/or caregiver involvement in discussions (with patient consent) early in the course of the illness for support and discussion about goals of care (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened a multidisciplinary Expert Panel to consider the evidence and formulate the recommendations. The Expert Panel met in person and via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail. Based on the consideration of the evidence, clinical experience, and a formal consensus process, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline.</p>
<p>Because of the limited evidence available for most of the clinical questions, recommendations were developed using the ASCO modified Delphi formal consensus methodology. This process involved the drafting of recommendations by a subgroup of the Expert Panel using clinical expertise and the available evidence. The Expert Panel met in person to review the recommendations. The Expert Panel was then supplemented by additional experts, who were recruited to rate their agreement with the recommendations. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. Each recommendation had to be agreed to by at least 75% of Consensus Panel respondents to be accepted.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the original guideline document are accompanied by strategies for implementation that were developed by the Expert Panel. These strategies were not voted on by the Consensus Panel, but the Consensus Panel was invited to comment on them. The Expert Panel also indicated the strength of each recommendation. For the evidence-based recommendations, the strength of the recommendation was driven by quality of the evidence. For the consensus recommendations, the strength of the recommendation was based on the opinion of the Expert Panel.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>. ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.</p>
