	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Issues Related to the Conduct of Surveillance</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommends that before starting any pancreatic cyst surveillance program, patients should have a clear understanding of programmatic risks and benefits. <strong>Note</strong>: This is a &quot;motherhood statement&quot; that does not require application of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that patients with pancreatic cysts &amp;lt;3 cm without a solid component or a dilated pancreatic duct undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for surveillance in 1 year and then every 2 years for a total of 5 years if there is no change in size or characteristics. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that pancreatic cysts with at least two high-risk features, such as size &amp;ge;3 cm, a dilated main pancreatic duct, or the presence of an associated solid component, should be examined with endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that patients without concerning EUS-FNA results should undergo MRI surveillance after 1 year and then every 2 years to ensure no change in risk of malignancy. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests that significant changes in the characteristics of the cyst, including the development of a solid component, increasing size of the pancreatic duct, and/or diameter &amp;ge;3 cm, are indications for EUS-FNA. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>When Can Pancreatic Cyst Surveillance Be Discontinued?</span> </strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>The AGA suggests against continued surveillance of pancreatic cysts if there has been no significant change in the characteristics of the cyst after 5 years of surveillance or if the patient is no longer a surgical candidate. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>When to Offer Surgery for Pancreatic Cysts</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>
    <li>The AGA suggests that patients with both a solid component and a dilated pancreatic duct and/or concerning features on EUS and FNA should undergo surgery to reduce the risk of mortality from carcinoma. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA recommends that if surgery is considered for a pancreatic cyst, patients are referred to a center with demonstrated expertise in pancreatic surgery. (<strong>Strong recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Surveillance After Surgery</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>The AGA suggests that patients with invasive cancer or dysplasia in a cyst that has been surgically resected should undergo MRI surveillance of any remaining pancreas every 2 years. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The AGA suggests against routine surveillance of pancreatic cysts without high-grade dysplasia or malignancy at surgical resection. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality evidence</strong>) </li>

<p>The literature search is described in detail in Appendix 1 in the technical review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). MEDLINE was searched from 1946 to July 2013, and reports evaluating pancreatic cystic neoplasms were identified by combining the exploded Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term &quot;pancreatic cyst&quot; with text words that contained &quot;pancreas&quot; (e.g., pancreas or pancreatic) and &quot;cyst&quot; that were separated by &amp;le;2 adjectives (e.g., such a search would detect &quot;cyst of the pancreas&quot; and &quot;pancreatic cysts&quot;). This was combined with the set operator &quot;OR&quot; and the exploded MeSH term &quot;pancreatic neoplasm,&quot; with a similar text word approach as described in the preceding text to identify other pancreatic neoplasms. Case reports, letters, and non&amp;ndash;English language reports were excluded.</p>
<p>A second search was performed to identify diagnostic studies. This identified pancreatic cysts as described in the preceding section combined with MeSH terms and text words that described ultrasonography (including endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS]), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP). Furthermore, reports that identified tumor markers and cyst fluid analysis were also identified with exploded MeSH terms and text words (see Appendix 1 in the technical review for details).</p>
<p>The first search identified more than 2,000 reports and the second search more than 1,500 reports, with duplicates excluded. These references were imported into EndNote version 7.0.1 (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA) and manually assessed for relevance by two reviewers. The same two reviewers also extracted data relevant for the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Results</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature search showed that reports are largely retrospective case series; there are no randomized controlled trials. A key limitation of the current literature is that management recommendations are based on knowledge of the specific cyst histology, which rarely can be determined using current imaging and cyst sampling techniques. This highlights the challenges of providing evidence based recommendations regarding the management of patients with pancreatic cysts. See the technical review for further information on the results of the literature search.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The technical review (and the accompanying guideline) was based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. In developing the technical review, the authors first formulated a series of specific questions that were to be answered by the guideline (see Appendix 1 in the technical review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The authors then identified the outcomes that were significant to answering each question and rated them as critical or important. Next, the group systematically reviewed and summarized the evidence for each outcome across studies, assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome, and finally integrated the evidence across all the outcomes to answer each specific question. The quality of the evidence was classified into four categories: high, moderate, low, and very low. Assessment of the quality for each outcome took into account the study design, risk of bias, inconsistency (or heterogeneity), indirectness, imprecision, and potential publication bias. See the &quot;Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations&quot; field for details on the GRADE methodology and the population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) questions.</p>
<p>Initially, the reviewers outlined a total of seven PICO questions (see Table 1 in the technical review). The patient populations with pancreatic cysts were further analyzed for risk of malignancy based on imaging studies, analysis of cyst fluid, and pathological findings. In addition, an analysis of the prevalence of pancreatic cysts in the population was performed, followed by an estimation of the risk of malignant progression of all pancreatic cysts. The reviewers used a consensus decision-making process (<a href=&quot;http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Seeds for Change Web site&quot;>http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus.pdf</a>) to reach unanimous agreement among the three authors on all statements.</p>
<p>Normally a guideline that uses the GRADE approach would provide a summary of findings table, but this was not possible due to the paucity of data available. The technical review therefore simply outlines the evidence from these surgical series in a narrative manner to provide the risk of invasive malignancy in this select group according to type of cyst. This will indirectly inform the type of pancreatic cyst that is likely to harbor dysplasia or malignancy. The guideline developers then evaluated the data according to which imaging modality best diagnosed the type of cyst and malignant risk and then conducted systematic reviews of the literature to address risk of malignant progression in pancreatic cysts that would not undergo initial surgery.</p>

<p>This guideline uses the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. This approach breaks down the management of patients with a specific disorder into a series of statements phrased in the PICO format that defines the population (P) under study, the intervention or investigation (I) under consideration, the comparator (C) against which that intervention or investigation is assessed, and the outcome (O) worthy of evaluation. It is important to emphasize that the outcomes in these statements should be focused on what is relevant to patients. In the case of pancreatic cysts, all statements refer to adult patients who have asymptomatic pancreatic cysts identified by radiology; if a comparator is not stated, then it is implied that the management strategy is being compared against &quot;do nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Both the quality of the available evidence and the strength of the recommendation are provided for each PICO statement. The evidence for the management of pancreatic cysts is summarized in the technical review that accompanies this guideline.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing the quality of the evidence, a strength of recommendation for each statement is made that considers, as a whole, the quality of the evidence, the risks and benefits of the strategy, the values and preferences of patients, and the cost (financial and otherwise) of the approach being recommended. A &quot;strong&quot; recommendation supports a clinical decision that should apply to most patients most of the time, whereas a &quot;conditional&quot; (also called &quot;weak&quot; in some settings) recommendation implies that the decision is more nuanced and a significant number of patients could have a different approach.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Pancreatic cysts are common and increase with age, but the development of invasive adenocarcinoma in these cysts is extremely rare. The management strategy for pancreatic cysts aims to prevent the development of invasive cancer and/or to resect invasive malignancy early when present. Current clinical practice is based on minimal evidence and relies almost exclusively on case series of frequent cross-sectional imaging with or without endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and surgery for concerning features. The preceding guidelines for asymptomatic mucinous cysts are different from all previously published guidelines in the following areas: 2-year interval for cyst of any size undergoing surveillance, stopping surveillance after 5 years if no change, surgery only if more than one concerning feature on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed on EUS and only in centers with high volumes of pancreatic surgery, and no surveillance after surgery if no invasive cancer or dysplasia. Although based on extensive literature review and synthesis, these recommendations may result in significant controversy because they advocate less frequent follow-up and a higher threshold before offering EUS and/or surgery. However, consistent utilization should decrease inadvertent harm to patients and reduce the costs of health care delivery.</p></div>"/>
