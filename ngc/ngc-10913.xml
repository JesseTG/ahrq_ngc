	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the overall quality of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, or <strong>insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that clinicians select between either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) to treat patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) after discussing treatment effects, adverse effect profiles, cost, accessibility, and preferences with the patient. (<strong>Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Moderate-quality evidence shows that CBT and SGAs are similarly effective treatments for MDD. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that discontinuation rates are similar for CBT and SGAs, although discontinuation due to adverse events is non&amp;ndash;statistically significantly increased with SGAs. However, harms associated with SGAs are probably underrepresented in the included trials. Thus, ACP concludes that CBT has no more&amp;mdash;and probably fewer&amp;mdash;adverse effects than SGAs. In addition, lower relapse rates have been reported with CBT than SGAs. Although SGAs are often initially prescribed for patients with depression, CBT is a reasonable approach for initial treatment and should be strongly considered as an alternative treatment to SGAs where available. Further, there are reported differences among SGAs in mild (constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, and somnolence) to major (sexual dysfunction and suicidality) adverse effects. Bupropion is associated with a lower rate of sexual adverse events than fluoxetine and sertraline, whereas paroxetine has higher rates of sexual dysfunction than fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, and sertraline. Physicians and patients should discuss adverse event profiles before selecting a medication.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from January 1990 to 23 September 2015. They used a combination of Medical Subject Heading terms and keywords, focusing on terms to describe the relevant population and interventions of interest. They limited electronic searches to &quot;adult 19+ years&quot;; &quot;human&quot;; and &quot;English, German, and Italian languages.&quot; Table 1 of the Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) shows the electronic search strategy. To detect unpublished studies, the investigators searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Drugs @FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the National Institute of Mental Health Web site, the American Psychological Association Web site, Scopus, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and reference lists of pertinent reviews and included trials.</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Scientific Resource Center requested scientific information packets from relevant manufacturing companies, asking for any unpublished studies or relevant data. The investigators received information packets from Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, Indiana) and Merck &amp;amp; Co. (Kenilworth, New Jersey).</p>
<p>To obtain unreported data from published trials, the investigators contacted authors.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two trained team members independently reviewed all abstracts and full-text articles by using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The population of interest was adult outpatients of all races and ethnicities with major depressive disorder (MDD) during 1) an initial treatment attempt or 2) a second treatment attempt in patients who did not achieve remission after treatment with a second-generation antidepressant (SGA). For patients with an initial treatment attempt, they were interested in the benefits and harms of SGAs compared with common depression-focused psychological interventions, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions, and exercise as 1) monotherapies, 2) in combination with one another, or 3) in combination with a SGA. For patients who did not achieve remission after an adequate trial with a SGA, they were interested in second-step therapies that could involve a switch to a new treatment or an augmentation of an existing treatment with a pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic option. The table in the systematic review shows the interventions that the investigators reviewed.</p>
<p>To assess the comparative benefits, the investigators limited studies to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 6 weeks' duration that compared 2 interventions of interest. In general, they included only double blinded RCTs. For interventions for which double blinding was not possible (such as psychological interventions or yoga), they required that outcomes assessors be blinded. For harms (evidence pertaining to safety, tolerability, and adverse events), the investigators intended to examine data from both randomized and nonrandomized studies (minimum sample size of 500), but found no eligible nonrandomized studies.</p>
<p>The investigators excluded studies that both reviewers agreed did not meet eligibility criteria. Investigators resolved disagreements about inclusion or exclusion by consensus or by involving a third reviewer. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the AHRQ report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of Quality of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators designed, pilot-tested, and used a structured data abstraction form to ensure consistency of data abstraction. Trained reviewers initially abstracted data from each study. A senior reviewer evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the data abstraction.</p>
<p>The investigators classified patients' severity of depression by using the categorization systems of the University of Pittsburgh Epidemiology Data Center and Zimmerman and colleagues.</p>
<p>To assess the risk of bias of studies, the investigators used definitions based on Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) guidance. They rated the risk of bias for each relevant outcome of a study as low, moderate, or high. To determine risk of bias in a standardized way, they used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to appraise randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two independent reviewers assigned risk-of-bias ratings. They resolved any disagreements by discussion and consensus or by consultation with a third reviewer.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>To determine whether meta-analyses were appropriate, the investigators assessed the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies under consideration by following established guidance. They combined studies that were similar in populations and interventions, and assessed outcomes at similar follow-up times (most commonly 8 to 16 weeks). For all analyses, they used random- and fixed-effects models to estimate comparative effects. The investigators used restricted maximum likelihood models for random-effects analyses.</p>
<p>For efficacy, the investigators conducted meta-analyses on the relative risk for achieving response (as defined by the study authors, most commonly as a &amp;ge;50% improvement from baseline) on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) or the Montgomery&amp;ndash;&amp;Aring;sberg Depression Rating Scale at study end point, and the relative risk for achieving remission (as defined by the study authors, most commonly as a HAM-D score &amp;lt;7) at study end point. For harms, they conducted meta-analyses on the relative risk for experiencing an adverse event, discontinuing treatment, and discontinuing treatment because of harms.</p>
<p>For each meta-analysis, the investigators tested for heterogeneity by using the Cochran Q test and estimated the extent of heterogeneity with the <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates attributable to heterogeneity). If heterogeneity was high (&amp;gt;60%), they explored differences in clinical and methodological characteristics among studies considered for meta-analyses.</p>
<p>Previous investigations have demonstrated that no substantial differences in benefits and harms exist among second-generation antidepressants (SGAs); therefore, in all meta-analyses, they compared SGAs as a class with other interventions of interest. The investigators categorize types of psychological interventions according to the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group classification system.</p>
<p>For all meta-analyses, the investigators conducted sensitivity analyses with and without high risk-of-bias studies.</p>
<p>They assessed publication bias by using funnel plots and Kendall &amp;tau; rank correlation. However, given the small number of component studies in the meta-analyses, these tests have low sensitivity to detect publication bias. They conducted meta-analyses by using OpenMetaAnalyst.</p></div>"/>

<p>This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review, an update of the literature (see the Supplement), and an evidence report sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) that addressed the following key questions:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>1a. In adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are undergoing an initial treatment attempt, what is the effectiveness of second-generation antidepressant (SGA) monotherapy compared with the effectiveness of either nonpharmacological monotherapy or combination therapy (involving nonpharmacological treatments with or without an SGA)? </li>
    <li>1b. Does comparative treatment effectiveness vary by MDD severity? </li>
    <li>2a. In adult patients with MDD who did not achieve remission following an initial adequate trial with one SGA, what is the comparative effectiveness of second-step therapies? </li>
    <li>2b. Does comparative treatment effectiveness vary by MDD severity? </li>
    <li>3a. In adult patients with MDD, what are the comparative risks of harms of these treatment options for those undergoing an initial treatment attempt or those who did not achieve remission following an initial adequate trial with an SGA? </li>
    <li>3b. Do the comparative risks of treatment harms vary by MDD severity? </li>
    <li>4. Do the benefits and risks of harms of these treatment options differ by subgroups of patients with MDD defined by common accompanying psychiatric symptoms (coexisting anxiety, insomnia, low energy, or somatization) or demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, or ethnicity)? </li>
