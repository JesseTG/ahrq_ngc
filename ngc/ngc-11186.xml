	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the overall quality of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, or <strong>insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure (SBP) persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target SBP of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events. (<strong>Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure (BP) targets with the patient.</p>
<p>High-quality evidence showed that treating hypertension in older adults to moderate targets (&amp;lt;150/90 mm Hg) reduces mortality (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1.64), stroke (ARR, 1.13), and cardiac events (ARR, 1.25). Most benefits apply to such adults regardless of whether they have diabetes. The most consistent and greatest absolute benefit was shown in trials with a higher mean SBP at baseline (&amp;gt;160 mm Hg). Any additional benefit from aggressive BP control is small, with a lower magnitude of benefit and inconsistent results across outcomes.</p>
<p>Although this guideline did not specifically address pharmacologic versus nonpharmacologic treatments for hypertension, several nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are available for consideration. Effective nonpharmacologic options for reducing BP include such lifestyle modifications as weight loss, such dietary changes as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and an increase in physical activity. Non-pharmacologic options are typically associated with fewer side effects than pharmacologic therapies and have other positive effects; ideally, they are included as the first therapy or used concurrently with drug therapy for most patients with hypertension. Effective pharmacologic options include antihypertensive medications, such as thiazide-type diuretics (adverse effects include electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal discomfort, rashes and other allergic reactions, sexual dysfunction in men, photosensitivity reactions, and orthostatic hypotension), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (adverse effects include cough and hyperkalemia), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) (adverse effects include dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia), calcium-channel blockers (adverse effects include dizziness, headache, edema, and constipation), and beta-blockers (adverse effects include fatigue and sexual dysfunction).</p>
<p>Most of the included studies measured seated BP after 5 minutes of rest and used multiple readings. Clinicians should ensure that they are accurately measuring BP before beginning or changing treatment of hypertension. Assessment may include multiple measurements in clinical settings (for example, 2 to 3 readings separated by 1 minute in a seated patient who is resting alone in a room) or ambulatory or home monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target SBP of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific BP targets with the patient.</p>
<p>Moderate-quality evidence showed that treating hypertension in older adults with previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke to an SBP target of 130 to 140 mm Hg reduces stroke recurrence (ARR, 3.02) compared with treatment to higher targets, with no statistically significant effect on cardiac events or all-cause mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target SBP of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific BP targets with the patient.</p>
<p>An SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg is a reasonable goal for some patients with increased cardiovascular risk. The target depends on many factors unique to each patient, including comorbidity, medication burden, risk for adverse events, and cost. Clinicians should individually assess cardiovascular risk for patients. Generally, increased cardiovascular risk includes persons with known vascular disease, most patients with diabetes, older persons with chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/ min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, those with metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia), and older persons. For example, among the included studies, SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) defined patients with increased cardiovascular risk as those meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: clinical or subclinical cardiovascular disease other than stroke; chronic kidney disease, excluding polycystic kidney disease, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area; 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease of 15% or greater based on the Framingham risk score; or age 75 years or older. This trial found that targeting SBP to less than 120 mm Hg compared with less than 140 mm Hg in adults without diabetes or prior stroke, at high-risk for cardiovascular disease, and with a baseline SBP of less than 140 mm Hg significantly reduced fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In contrast, ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) included only adults with type 2 diabetes and found no statistically significant reduction in the primary composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular events (relative risk [RR], 0.94 [confidence interval (CI), 0.80 to 1.11]). This study did find a reduction in stroke events (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.39 to 0.88]), but there were more serious adverse events associated with an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm Hg.</p>

<p>The investigators searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception (refer to Appendix A in the systematic review supplement).

<p>The investigators reviewed titles and abstracts, and 2 independent reviewers evaluated the full articles for inclusion; disagreements were resolved through consensus.

Investigators excluded trials directly comparing antihypertensive drugs with one another and studies in populations with specific diagnoses in which medications were used primarily for effects other than BP lowering (for example, studies of beta-blockade in patients with systolic heart failure or studies of acute myocardial infarction). They included cohort studies that reported adverse effects associated with reductions in BP among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: A systematic evidence review was conducted by the Evidence-based Synthesis Program Center located at the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>One investigator abstracted data elements from each study, and a second investigator reviewed entries for accuracy. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each trial using a tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Each trial was given an overall summary assessment of low, high, or unclear risk of bias (see detailed criteria in Appendix C of the systematic review supplement).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Primary effectiveness outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, stroke (fatal or nonfatal), and cardiac events (myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death), all after at least 6 months of treatment. The investigators examined the following harms: cognitive impairment, quality of life, falls, fractures, syncope, functional status, hypotension, acute kidney injury (defined as doubling of serum creatinine level or need for renal replacement therapy), medication burden, and withdrawal due to adverse events. The investigators did not specifically search for studies reporting well-known drug-specific adverse effects, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)&amp;ndash;induced cough or thiazide diuretic&amp;ndash;induced hypokalemia, but they described common adverse events of intensive therapy leading to higher rates of withdrawal among trials. The overall strength of evidence for each outcome was classified after group discussion as high, moderate, low, or insufficient based on the consistency, coherence, and applicability of the body of evidence as well as the internal validity of individual studies.</p>
<p>The investigators conducted study-level meta-analyses to generate pooled estimates for each outcome after considering clinical and methodological diversity among studies. The profile-likelihood random-effects model was used to combine relative risks (RRs). They assessed the magnitude of statistical heterogeneity among studies using the standard Cochran chi-square test, the<em> I</em><sup>2</sup> statistic. All analyses were performed using Stata/IC 13.1 (StataCorp).</p>
<p>Several sensitivity analyses were performed to help address the heterogeneity of study design and patient populations. Because studies with a lower mean age were likely to include patients younger than 60 years, the investigators conducted separate analyses of studies with a mean population age of at least 70 years and studies with inclusion criteria stipulating entry age of at least 60 years to ensure that results were consistent. Studies were analyzed according to baseline blood pressure (BP) to compare treatment effects among patients with moderate to severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &amp;ge;160 mm Hg) versus those with mild hypertension (SBP &amp;lt;160 mm Hg), and the investigators analyzed studies according to achieved BP (SBP &amp;lt;140 mm Hg). They also conducted analyses with and without trials that achieved minimal between-group differences in SBP (&amp;le;3 mm Hg).</p>
<p>Trials specifically comparing BP targets of SBP less than 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) of 85 mm Hg or lower versus higher targets were examined because these trials most directly address the incremental benefit of treatment intensification in mild hypertension. Finally, the investigators examined secondary prevention of stroke by examining BP treatment effects in studies of patients with prior stroke, but excluded those of acute management of stroke (&amp;lt;1 week).</p></div>"/>
