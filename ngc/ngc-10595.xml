	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The grades for strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong recommendation</strong>, <strong>Recommendation</strong>, <strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Laboratories must validate all immunohistochemical (IHC) tests before placing into clinical service. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>)
    <p><em>Note</em>: Such means include (but are not necessarily limited to):</p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Correlating the new test's results with the morphology and expected results </li>
        <li>Comparing the new test's results with the results of prior testing of the same tissues with a validated assay in the same laboratory </li>
        <li>Comparing the new test's results with the results of testing the same tissue validation set in another laboratory using a validated assay </li>
        <li>Comparing the new test's results with previously validated non-immunohistochemical tests </li>
        <li>Testing previously graded tissue challenges from a formal proficiency testing program (if available) and comparing the results with the graded responses </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>For initial validation of every assay used clinically, with the exception of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/<em>neu</em>), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PgR) (for which established validation guidelines already exist), laboratories should achieve at least 90% overall concordance between the new test and the comparator test or expected results. If concordance is less than 90%, laboratories need to investigate the cause of low concordance. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For initial analytic validation of nonpredictive factor assays, laboratories should test a minimum of 10 positive and 10 negative tissues. When the laboratory medical director determines that fewer than 20 validation cases are sufficient for a specific marker (e.g., rare antigen), the rationale for that decision needs to be documented. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p><em>Note</em>: The validation set should include high and low expressors for positive cases when appropriate and should span the expected range of clinical results (expression levels) for markers that are reported quantitatively.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>For initial analytic validation of all laboratory-developed predictive marker assays (with the exception of HER2/<em>neu</em>, ER, and PgR), laboratories should test a minimum of 20 positive and 20 negative tissues. When the laboratory medical director determines that fewer than 40 validation tissues are sufficient for a specific marker, the rationale for that decision needs to be documented. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p><em>Note</em>: Positive cases in the validation set should span the expected range of clinical results (expression levels). This recommendation does not apply to any marker for which a separate validation guideline already exists.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>For a marker with both predictive and nonpredictive applications, laboratories should validate it as a predictive marker if it is used as such. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>When possible, laboratories should use validation tissues that have been processed by using the same fixative and processing methods as cases that will be tested clinically. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>If IHC is regularly done on cytologic specimens that are not processed in the same manner as the tissues used for assay validation (e.g., alcohol-fixed cell blocks, air-dried smears, formalin-postfixed specimens), laboratories should test a sufficient number of such cases to ensure that assays consistently achieve expected results. The laboratory medical director is responsible for determining the number of positive and negative cases and the number of predictive and nonpredictive markers to test. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>If IHC is regularly done on decalcified tissues, laboratories should test a sufficient number of such tissues to ensure that assays consistently achieve expected results. The laboratory medical director is responsible for determining the number of positive and negative tissues and the number of predictive and nonpredictive markers to test. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories may use whole sections, tissue microarrays (TMAs), and/or multitissue blocks (MTBs) in their validation sets as appropriate. Whole sections should be used if TMAs/MTBs are not appropriate for the targeted antigen or if the laboratory medical director cannot confirm that the fixation and processing of TMAs/MTBs is similar to clinical specimens. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>When a new reagent lot is placed into clinical service for an existing validated assay, laboratories should confirm the assay's performance with at least 1 known positive case and 1 known negative case. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should confirm assay performance with at least 2 known positive and 2 known negative cases when an existing validated assay has changed in any one of the following ways:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Antibody dilution </li>
        <li>Antibody vendor (same clone) </li>
        <li>Incubation or retrieval times (same method). (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
    <li>Laboratories should confirm assay performance by testing a sufficient number of cases to ensure that assays consistently achieve expected results when any of the following have changed:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Fixative type </li>
        <li>Antigen retrieval method (e.g., change in pH, different buffer, different heat platform) </li>
        <li>Antigen detection system </li>
        <li>Tissue processing or testing equipment </li>
        <li>Environmental conditions of testing (e.g., laboratory relocation) </li>
        <li>Laboratory water supply </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The laboratory medical director is responsible for determining how many predictive and nonpredictive markers and how many positive and negative tissues to test. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;13&quot;>
    <li>Laboratories should run a full revalidation (equivalent to initial analytic validation) when the antibody clone is changed for an existing validated assay. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>The laboratory must document all validations and verifications in compliance with regulatory and accreditation requirements. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Grading the quality of individual studies was performed from study design&amp;ndash;specific criteria by the methodology consultant (L.A.B.), with input as needed from the expert panel. The aim of analytic validation is to determine a test's ability to accurately and reliably detect the antigen or marker of interest in specimens consistent with those to be tested in clinical practice. Analytic validity studies have a different design, compared to studies of diagnostic accuracy or therapeutic interventions. For this reason, the criteria needed to assess the quality of analytic validity studies are different. Quality in this context is considered to be essentially equivalent to internal validity and is assessed on the basis of study design and execution, analyses, and reporting. The strength of evidence for individual key questions or outcomes was assessed by using published criteria. The criteria included the quality and execution of studies, the quantity of data (number and size of studies), and the consistency and generalizability of the evidence across studies. Strength of evidence was graded convincing, adequate, or inadequate (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center as a forum to create and maintain evidence-based practice guidelines and consensus statements. Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and expert consensus supported in practice. They are intended to assist physicians and patients in clinical decision making and to identify questions and settings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific information, new evidence may emerge between the time a practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and when it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines and statements address only the topics specifically identified therein and are not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and statements cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances and preferences.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Before acceptance on the expert or advisory panel, potential members completed the College of American Pathologists (CAP) conflict of interest disclosure process, whose policy and form (in effect April 2010) require disclosure of material financial interest in or potential for benefit of significant value from the guideline's development or its recommendations 12 months prior through the time of publication. Potential members completed the conflict of interest disclosure form, listing any relationship that could be interpreted as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict. Everyone was required to disclose conflicts before beginning and continuously throughout the project's timeline. One expert panel member (R.S.F.) was recused from discussion and voting on the recommendation pertaining to tissue microarrays, and one (T.S.H.) was recused from voting on recommendations pertaining to potential increased antibody usage. Expert panel members' disclosed conflicts are listed in the Appendix of the original guideline document. Please see the supplemental digital content for full details on the conflict of interest policy (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>
