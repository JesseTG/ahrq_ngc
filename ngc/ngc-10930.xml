	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Noncardiac Thoracic Imaging</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pleural Effusion</strong></p>
<p><em>Suitability of Ultrasound to Establish the Diagnosis and Assist in Drainage</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Panel recommends that ultrasound should be used to complement physical examination and conventional chest radiography to diagnose and localize a pleural effusion. <strong>Grade 1A.</strong> </li>
    <li>The Panel recommends that ultrasound guidance should be used to assist in drainage (including needle guidance), particularly of small or loculated effusions compared with landmark technique. <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </li>
    <li>The Panel has no recommendation regarding the preference for use of either static or dynamic technique to do so. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Pneumothorax</strong></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that ultrasound should be used to complement or replace conventional chest radiography to diagnose a pneumothorax, depending on the clinical setting and need for rapid results. <strong>Grade 1A.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Interstitial and Parenchymal Lung Pathology</strong></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that a systematic approach incorporating bedside ultrasound may be a primary diagnostic modality for the intensive care unit (ICU) patient with respiratory failure. <strong>Grade 2B.</strong> </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Abdominal Imaging</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ascites (Nontrauma Setting)</strong></p>
<p><em>Suitability of Ultrasound to Establish the Diagnosis to Assist in Drainage</em></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that ultrasound guidance (instead of the landmark technique), whether real-time or preprocedure, should be used to determine the optimal location for performance of paracentesis. <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Acalculous Cholecystitis</strong></p>
<p><em>Suitability of Ultrasound to Establish the Diagnosis</em></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that bedside ultrasonography may be used to provide additional valuable information to the clinical presentation to establish the diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis. <strong>Grade 2C.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Ability of the Intensivist to Use Ultrasound to Establish the Diagnosis Accurately</em></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that intensivists/critical care providers should not personally perform ultrasound primarily for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. <strong>Grade 2B.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Causes of Anuria/Oliguria</strong></p>
<p><em>Suitability of Ultrasound to Establish the Diagnosis Thereof</em></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that ultrasonography may be used to exclude mechanical causes of acute renal failure in the ICU. <strong>Grade 2C.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Ability of the Critical Care Provider to Use Ultrasound to Establish the Diagnosis Accurately</em></p>
<p>The Panel has no recommendations regarding this issue due to the paucity of data. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Vascular Imaging</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)</strong></p>
<p><em>Complete versus Focused Examination of the Lower Extremities</em></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that a focused ultrasound technique using gray scale imaging to evaluate vein compression at the common femoral and popliteal veins should be used to diagnose most proximal DVTs (compared with contrast venography). <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Accuracy of Focused DVT Screening by Critical Care Providers</em></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that intensivists can reliably perform a focused screening examination by ultrasound to diagnose lower extremity proximal DVT. <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Imaging to Assist Intravascular Catheter Insertion</strong></p>
<p><em>General Consideration</em></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that ultrasound guidance of vessel cannulation (compared with landmark technique) should be used to improve the success rate, shorten procedure time and reduce the risk of procedure-related complications such as pneumothorax. <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Components of the Examination</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Static versus Dynamic (Preprocedure vs Real-time)</span></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that in most patients, the use of realtime ultrasound is preferred over static, preprocedure marking. <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Long Versus Short Axis</span></p>
<p>Although there are benefits to visualizing the vasculature in both short- and long-axis images by ultrasound, the Panel recommends that the short-axis view be used during insertion to improve success rate. <strong>Grade 1B.</strong> </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>One- Versus Two-person Ultrasound-guided Vascular Cannulation</span></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that one- (rather than two-) person technique is sufficient for ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation. <strong>Grade 1C.</strong> </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Use of Doppler</span></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that conventional B-mode imaging to assist in vessel cannulation should be used compared with using audible Doppler only with no imaging. <strong>Grade 2B.</strong> </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Use of Needle Guides</span></p>
<p>The Panel has no recommendation regarding routine use of a device placed on the ultrasound transducer to guide needle placement. This should be left to provider discretion. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Completion Examination</span></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that a detailed postcannulation ultrasound examination may be used (instead of conventional chest radiography) to confirm catheter location and exclude a pneumothorax in adult patients. <strong>Grade 2B.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Internal Jugular Location</em></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that dynamic ultrasound-guided internal jugular (IJ) venous cannulation should be used (instead of landmark technique) to improve success rate, shorten procedure time and reduce the risk of procedure-related complications in adult patients. <strong>Grade 1A.</strong></p>
<p><em>Subclavian/Axillary Location</em></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that ultrasound dynamic guidance is of limited value for most operators to guide subclavian vein catheterization in adult patients (and that landmark technique is used instead). <strong>Grade 2C.</strong></p>
<p><em>Femoral Location</em></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that ultrasound dynamic guidance (instead of the landmark technique) should be used to improve the success rate and reduce complications for femoral venous cannulation although this benefit is mostly realized by novice operators in adult patients. <strong>Grade 1A.</strong></p>
<p><em>Other Locations</em></p>
<p>The Panel suggests that the use of ultrasound dynamic guidance (instead of the landmark technique) may improve the success rate and diminish complications during peripheral venous (adults and children) and arterial cannulation (adults). <strong>Grade 2B</strong> for venous and <strong>2B</strong> for arterial catheterization. </p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Approach</span></strong></p>
<p>There were two plenary sessions of the writing committee group leaders to establish the content. The guidelines process followed combined Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and RAND appropriateness method (RAM). RAM included modified Delphi method, teleconferences, and several subsequent meetings (including electronically) of subgroups.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Scientific Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical questions related to the use of bedside ultrasound were established by the writing group for subsequent discussion, grading of evidence by a methodologist, and then voting on the overall appropriateness of the recommendation. The questions generated statements that constituted draft recommendations during the process of guideline development. (Statements can be approved and become formal recommendations or be disapproved and never reach that stage. Also, during the writing phase, it is possible to combine two or more approved statements into one recommendation.)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Consensus and Clinical Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Electronic discussions and meetings occurred among subgroup members to generate the final recommendations presented. GRADE method was used to develop these evidence-based recommendations. The process involves two phases: 1) developing the recommendation and 2) determining the level of quality of evidence. Relevant articles with clinical outcomes were classified into three levels of quality based on the criteria of the GRADE methodology. This was done using GRADEpro Software (<a href=&quot;http://www.gradepro.org&quot; title=&quot;GRADEpro Web site&quot;>http://www.gradepro.org</a>; McMaster University). It assesses nine quality factors including study design with five potential downgraders and three possible upgraders.</p>
<p>RAM was used within the GRADE steps that required panel judgment and decisions/consensus. RAM was also used in formulating the recommendations based purely on expert consensus. Recommendations were generated in two classes: strong (class 1) or weak/conditional (class 2) based on the GRADE criteria taking into consideration preset rules that defined the panel consensus/agreement and its degree. The transformation of evidence into recommendation depends not only on the level of quality of evidence but also on the panel's judgment on problem priority/importance, benefit/burden balance, and benefit/harm balance, and certainty/concern about four issues: preferences of patients, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Combining the strength of recommendations, strong (1) or conditional/weak (2) with the &quot;levels&quot; of quality of evidence high (A), moderate (B), or low (C) will eventually generate six possible &quot;grades&quot; of recommendations (1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C). For example, a 1C recommendation means that although there is a lack of quality of evidence, the recommendation is strong based on expert consensus. Conversely, a 2A indicates a weak recommendation due to consideration of transformative factors despite high-quality evidence.</p>
<p>The RAM process included a modified Delphi method in a consensus conference and several subsequent meetings of subgroups. There were two plenary sessions of the writing committee group leaders to establish the content. Electronic discussions occurred among subgroup members to generate the final grading presented. A strong recommendation is worded as &quot;the Panel recommends,&quot; whereas a conditional/weak recommendation as &quot;the Panel suggests.&quot;</p>
<p>The implication of strong versus weak/conditional recommendation is explained in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field. The list of the most relevant literature reference is provided for each recommendation and is limited to no more than 10 articles. Differences in opinion were resolved using a set of rules previously described in development of the Surviving Sepsis guidelines. Recommendations rendered required more than 70% of committee support. Strong recommendations required at least an 80% majority following the previously validated RAND algorithm (Figure 1 and Appendix 1 of the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Guidelines are based on the notion that any bedside ultrasound information is complimentary to physical examination and intensivist clinical judgment and therefore organized around most common suspected intensive care unit (ICU) diagnoses. Guidelines for repeat examinations are predicated on significance of the change in patient condition or to follow the outcome of a therapeutic intervention. </p></div>"/>

    <li>Ultrasound assisted intravascular catheter insertion improves success rate, shortens procedure time and reduces the risk of procedure-related complications. </li>
    <li>Ultrasound can improve the success rate and help determine the safest pathway through which to perform a paracentesis. A prospective, randomized emergency medicine (EM) study of 83 patients relates a success rate of 95% versus 61% in image-guided versus blind paracentesis. </li>
    <li>Bedside ultrasonography may be used to provide additional valuable information to the clinical presentation to establish the diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis. </li>
    <li>The use of ultrasound may be beneficial to rule in but not to rule out or exclude an effusion. Other data indicate a favorable accuracy (nearly 100%) compared with chest computed tomography (CT). Furthermore, complications (pneumothorax, failure to acquire fluid) associated with draining large pleural effusions were decreased from 33% or 50% to 0% when they were drained using ultrasound guidance. </li>
    <li>Renal ultrasound can readily detect the presence or absence of hydronephrosis&amp;mdash;the indicator of obstructive uropathy&amp;mdash;the mechanical and treatable cause of acute renal failure in those who are not hypovolemic. In addition, it can detect reduced renal size and echogenicity, features of chronic renal insufficiency and/or failure. </li>
    <li>Benefits of using ultrasound imaging to visualize catheter tip and guidewire in the long axis include the ability to observe the guidewire in the vessel and the tip of the needle to minimize the risk of &quot;past pointing.&quot; </li>

    <li>Recommendations from these guidelines must be used in context of the clinical picture and should not supersede judgment. This document sets forth recommendations underpinned by evidence of varied quality but does not aim to define the standard of care. This is in spite of the fact that the guidelines do offer several recommendations based on high-quality evidence. Unlike guidelines based on delivering therapy or performing automated diagnostic tests, the Panel acknowledges that the present work addresses the performance of technical tasks by humans with variable degrees of proficiency. In this document, the Panel assumes that practitioners of ultrasound, be they intensivists or not, are suitably trained and competent in the technical and interpretative components of the relevant examination. It is beyond the scope to these guidelines to describe in detail the elements of training and competency. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and others have developed language and recommendations to further define parameters for training and competence elsewhere. However, the Panel does address the use of ultrasound for novice versus experienced providers where those data exist. </li>
    <li>It is clear that the use of intensive care unit (ICU) ultrasound is quite a dynamic field. The Panel has developed these guidelines based on current evidence. It is quite possible, even probable, that the use of ICU ultrasound (and what diagnostic and therapeutic procedures the intensivist can and should be expected to perform) will continue to evolve. </li>
