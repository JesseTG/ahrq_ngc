	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) Best Practice Research and Development Team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between January 2011 and June 2016. The resulting list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites and recommendations from the literature. Expert panel members were also asked to suggest additional guidelines (see Figure D1 in the original guideline document). Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria, is available in the search strategy document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's Best Practice Research and Development Team and a health sciences librarian based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles published in English between January 2011 and November 2016 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC) was only used for Question Three. In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria and search terms, is available in the guideline search strategy document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, two RNAO nursing research associates (registered nurses holding master's degrees) independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreements at this stage were resolved through tie-breaking by a guideline development co-lead.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong> </p>
<p>Panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify key articles not found through the above search strategies. Articles identified by panel members were included in the search results if two nursing research associates independently determined the articles had not been identified by the literature search and met the inclusion criteria.</p></div>"/>

<p>The guideline development co-leads appraised seven international guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE) II. Guidelines with an overall score of four or below were considered to be weak and were excluded. Guidelines with an overall score of five were considered to be moderate, and guidelines with a score of six or seven were considered to be strong. The following guideline, rated moderate, was selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence:</p>
<p>World Health Organization. (2013). Guidelines for the management of conditions specifically related to stress. Geneva, Switzerland: Author.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Quality appraisal scores for 27 articles (a random sample of approximately 20 per cent of the total articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) nursing research associates. Quality appraisal was assessed using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and RNAO's scoring system, which rates reviews as low, moderate, or high. The nursing research associates reached acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, K = 0.855), which justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction for the remaining studies. The remaining studies were divided equally between the two research associates for quality appraisal and data extraction. A final narrative summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and narrative summaries were provided to all expert panel members for review and discussion.</p>

<p>For this guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope of this guideline, supported by the four research questions listed below. The systematic review captured relevant peer-reviewed literature published between January 2011 and November 2016. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>What are effective and trauma-informed interventions that can be utilized by nurses and the interprofessional team with adults experiencing crisis? </li>
    <li>What are effective and trauma-informed interventions that can be utilized by nurses and the interprofessional team to mitigate or prevent future crisis in adults? </li>
    <li>What content and educational strategies are necessary to educate nurses and the interprofessional team effectively regarding crisis and trauma-informed approaches? </li>
    <li>What organization- and system-level supports are needed by nurses and the interprofessional team to implement best practices effectively using trauma-informed approaches to crisis? </li>
</ol>
<p>The RNAO Best Practice Research and Development Team and expert panel worked to integrate the most current and best evidence, and to ensure the appropriateness and safety of the guideline recommendations with supporting evidence and/or expert panel consensus.</p>
<p>A modified Delphi technique was employed to obtain panel consensus on the recommendations.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In addition to the benefits of creating crisis plans outlined in the &quot;Evidence Summary&quot; for recommendation 1.3, health-care providers are able to understand the person's unique situation, can assess the person's risk more effectively and are able to provide early interventions to prevent future crisis. </li>
    <li>In addition to the benefits of outreach teams outlined in the &quot;Evidence Summary&quot; for recommendation 1.4, outreach teams also have the potential to reduce visits to the emergency department for psychiatric crisis situations. </li>
    <li>Benefits of utilizing telecommunication- and technology-based solutions with people at risk for, or experiencing, crisis include working with media to avoid sensationalization of the crisis event (e.g., natural disaster or mass suicide event) among the wider public. It also allows coordination with police in high-risk areas to provide around-the-clock vigilance and support and to create awareness campaigns for the wider public (e.g., raising awareness of signs and symptoms of crisis, and creating early identification messaging and media campaigns to promote awareness of the telephone service). Telecommunication- and technology-based solutions are also less stigmatizing than seeking help in person, more cost-effective, less time-consuming, not limited to business hours or geographical boundaries, and more likely to maintain person-provider confidentiality. </li>
    <li>The benefit of receiving services four weeks post-crisis is mitigation of future crises and/or other associated mental and physical harms. Research demonstrates that persons living with mental illness that receive long-term interventions recover from the crisis. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The urgency for follow-up and referral is heightened when enacting brief interventions (BI) to manage crisis leading to or following a suicide attempt. The provider needs to screen for suicide risk, create safety plans, and connect the person to appropriate resources and/or providers. </li>
    <li>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) expert panel notes that debriefing a crisis situation may trigger negative emotional outcomes and temporarily impede a person's ability to reach a pre-crisis state. When this occurs, health-care providers should offer the person the choice to stop this intervention. Before using this approach, an evaluation of critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) specific to the person's situation is advisable in order to weigh the benefits and harms that may occur from debriefing. </li>
    <li>Potential harms of creating crisis plans may be anxiety among persons who have experienced crisis that stems from being unable to meet expectations outline in the crisis plan. </li>
    <li>Peer support workers trained in psychological first aid (PFA) should only assist in the provision of basic care, comfort, and support to persons experiencing crisis. Exceeding these boundaries may cause clear harm to persons experiencing crisis. Organizations should create clear distinctions of roles and develop policies that support distinction between roles. </li>
    <li>The literature has demonstrated that telecommunication- and technology-based solutions used as part of psycho-education and/or skill development may pose harm to those who live in geographically remote or isolated areas (such as rural and remote regions or areas where telecommunications are inoperative or limited) when those persons need urgent post-conflict or post-disaster face-to-face treatment but are some distance from their care providers. As such, health-care providers and other interprofessional team members must be cognizant that these strategies are not exclusive treatment forms, and that they do not replace face-to-face interventions, but that they can provide a first step into the health-care system. </li>
    <li>Although there are benefits of police presence in ensuring safety and stabilization for persons experiencing crisis, the panel also recognizes that a police presence during a crisis intervention may trigger negative emotional outcomes in some persons. Considerations (such as not wearing a police uniform) should be taken for reducing the potential for emotional harm. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines for practice to change. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way in order to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO's) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2012) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in healthcare is more likely when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process. </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation. </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed. </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context. </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed. </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected. </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained. </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process. </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the &quot;Knowledge-to-Action&quot; framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis (see Figure 2 in original guideline document). It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and its implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of its Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs.) RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination that incorporates a variety of strategies, including:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&amp;reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs. </li>
    <li>Nursing order sets, which provide clear, concise, and actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records (although they may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments). </li>
    <li>The Best Practice Spotlight Organization&amp;reg; (BPSO&amp;reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs&amp;reg; focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, RNAO offers annual capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation. Information about our implementation strategies can be found at:</p>
