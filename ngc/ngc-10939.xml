	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Target Population</span></strong> </p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adult patients with recurrent low grade glioma with initial pathologic diagnosis of a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II infiltrative glioma (oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pathology at Recurrence</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>Do pathologic and molecular characteristics predict outcome/malignant transformation at recurrence?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p><em>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) Status and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. IDH mutation status should be determined as low grade gliomas with IDH mutations have a shortened time to recurrence. It is unclear whether knowledge of IDH mutation status provides benefit in predicting time to progression or overall survival. </p>
<p><em>TP53 Status and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. <em>&amp;nbsp;</em>mutations occur early in low grade glioma pathogenesis, remain stable, and are not recommended as a marker of predisposition to malignant transformation at recurrence or other measures of prognosis. </p>
<p><em>Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT) Status and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Assessment of MGMT status is recommended as an adjunct to assessing prognosis as low grade gliomas with MGMT promoter methylation are associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (in the absence of temozolomide [TMZ]) and longer post-recurrence survival (in the presence of TMZ), ultimately producing similar overall survival to low grade gliomas without MGMT methylation. The available retrospective reports are conflicting and comparisons between reports are limited. </p>
<p><em>CDK2NA Status and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Assessment of CDK2NA status is recommended when possible as the loss of expression of the CDK2NA via either methylation or loss of chromosome 9p is associated with malignant progression of low grade gliomas. </p>
<p><em>Proliferative Index and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. It is recommended that proliferative indices (MIB-1 or BUdR) be measured in low grade gliomas as higher proliferation indices are associated with increased likelihood of recurrence and shorter progression-free and overall survival. </p>
<p><em>1p/19q Status and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Chemotherapy at Recurrence</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>What role does chemotherapy have in low grade glioma recurrence?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p><em>Temozolomide and Recurrence</em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Temozolomide is recommended in the therapy of recurrent low grade glioma as it may improve clinical symptoms. Oligodendrogliomas and tumors with 1p/19q co-deletion may derive the most benefit. </p>
<p><em>Procarbazine, Lomustine, Vincristine (PCV) and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. PCV is recommended in the therapy of low grade glioma at recurrence as it may improve clinical symptoms with the strongest evidence being for oligodendrogliomas. </p>
<p><em>Carboplatin and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Carboplatin is not recommended as there is no significant benefit from carboplatin as single agent therapy for recurrent low grade gliomas. </p>
<p><em>Other Treatments (Nitrosureas, Hydroxyurea/Imatinib, Irinotecan, Paclitaxel) and Recurrence</em> </p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations. It is recommended that individuals with recurrent low grade gliomas be enrolled in a properly designed clinical trial to assess these chemotherapeutic agents. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Radiation at Recurrence</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>What role does radiation have in low grade glioma recurrence?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p><em>Radiation at Recurrence with No Previous Irradiation</em> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Radiation is recommended at recurrence if there was no previous radiation treatment. </p>
<p><em>Re-irradiation at Recurrence </em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. It is recommended that re-irradiation be considered in the setting of low grade glioma recurrence as it may provide benefit in disease control. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Surgery at Recurrence</span></strong> </p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make any specific recommendations. It is recommended that individuals with recurrent low grade gliomas be enrolled in a properly designed clinical trial to assess the role of surgery at recurrence. </p>

<p><strong>Literature Examination Approach</strong></p>
<p>A wide-ranging literature search strategy was undertaken to identify all citations relevant to the management of low grade gliomas (LGGs). The MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from 1990 through 2012, with additional data being gleaned from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. The search strategies used a combination of subheadings and text words with the specifics of this work being outlined in each guideline section. Reference lists of the publications chosen for full text review were also screened for potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>The search of the bibliographic databases identified possibly relevant citations for a given topic and often these were large in number. The eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria to screen the citations for each of the questions were determined ahead of time for each section by the writing group. At least two authors evaluated the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria with broad interpretation of the criteria being used initially so as to maximize the likelihood of capturing pertinent information. Cases of disagreement about pertinence were resolved by a third author when needed. The full text articles of the selected abstracts were then collected and the same process of applying the eligibility criteria was carried out again with the more in depth information available. Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented so as to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Specific Search Strategy for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>The following electronic databases were searched from 1990 to December 2012: PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using relevant MeSH and non-MeSH terms, including &quot;glioma&quot;, &quot;low grade glioma&quot;, &quot;recurrence&quot;, &quot;neoplasm recurrence, local&quot;, &quot;disease progression&quot;, &quot;astrocytoma&quot;, and &quot;low grade astrocytoma.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Eligibility Criteria</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Peer-reviewed publications</li>
    <li>Patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade II oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma or imaging suggestive of those diagnoses. In publications with mixed populations, those patients with recurrent diagnosed WHO grade II tumor were included if their information could be isolated and analyzed separately from the remainder of the reported cohort. </li>
    <li>Each study had at least five or more study participants with previously confirmed WHO grade 2 tumors suspicious for recurrence </li>
    <li>Patients greater than 17 years of age. Studies with mixed adult and child populations were included if the adult cohorts could be isolated and analyzed separately. </li>
    <li>Publications in English</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Study Selection </strong></p>
<p>The search criteria was examined and performed by two independent reviewers. Citations were independently reviewed and included if they met the a priori criteria for relevance. No discrepancies in study eligibility were noted. Corresponding full-text PDFs were obtained for all citations meeting the criteria, and reviewed.</p></div>"/>

<p>Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented so as to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p>Studies which met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by one reviewer and the extracted information was checked by one or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all of the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact filled manner so as to allow for understanding of the literature entry. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the scientific foundation of each section so as to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee Guideline Development Methodology document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing between writers electronically, by telephone and meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Guideline Panel Development</strong></span></p>
<p>Recognizing the serious nature of low grade gliomas along with the lack of consensus among various treatment options, the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) recommended that evidence-based guidelines be developed as a top priority, for the diagnosis, management and treatment of low grade glioma patients. The objectives of these guidelines are to establish the best evidence-based management of low grade gliomas in terms of imaging diagnosis, use of surgical biopsy and resection, assessment of tumor pathology, administration of systemic chemotherapy, and administration of radiation therapy. Because these tumors dependably recur or progress despite standard therapy, the Joint Tumor Section also recommended an evidence-based guideline be developed for progressive low grade gliomas and that information on promising emerging therapies be assessed in the same manner to determine the possible application of these findings.</p>
<p>Having identified the topical objectives, the Guidelines Committee of the Joint Tumor Section then recruited experts in the field from each of the parent organizations as lead writers of each section. These writers, in turn, recruited experts in non-neurosurgical specialties relevant to the field of management and therapy chosen. Writers were provided training on the method of guideline development as used in this guideline set by written methods and instructions. The senior authors and CNS Guidelines Manager then worked with them on a step by step basis to confirm that the methods were followed as the literature was collected, assessed and documents developed. When writers were approached and preliminarily agreed to participate they were asked to complete a formal conflict of interest questionnaire confirming the appropriateness of their participation. At that point they also agreed to report any new conflicts of interest that might develop during the writing process. In this manner a multidisciplinary panel of writers referred to as the Low Grade Glioma Guidelines Task Force was assembled, with significant administrative, logistical and analytical support from the national CNS Guidelines Committee. The method of this evidence-based clinical practice parameter guideline has been written in a manner to be as transparent as possible using published assessment criteria.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Topic Range of This Systematic Review and Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>Having identified writing groups for each topic, the members designed questions to allow assessment of the literature in a manner that would provide guidance for management of low grade gliomas. These questions are presented at the beginning of each of the eight guideline chapters spanning the topics of imaging assessment, diagnostic biopsy, surgical resection, tumor evaluation by standard neuropathology and molecular techniques, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, emerging therapies and treatment of recurrent or progressive low grade gliomas.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise, in order to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>"/>
