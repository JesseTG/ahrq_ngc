	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 1</span></strong> </p>
<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) strongly recommends rate control in preference to rhythm control for the majority of patients who have atrial fibrillation (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). Preferred options for rate-control therapy include non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. Rhythm control may be considered for certain patients based on patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preferences (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 2</span></strong> </p>
<p>The AAFP recommends lenient rate control (&amp;lt;110 beats per minute resting) over strict rate control (&amp;lt;80 beats per minute resting) for patients who have atrial fibrillation (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 3</span></strong> </p>
<p>The AAFP recommends that clinicians discuss the risk of stroke and bleeding with all patients considering anticoagulation (<strong>good practice point</strong>). Clinicians should consider using the continuous CHADS<sub>2</sub> (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75+, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolic event) or continuous CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75+, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolic event, Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category) for prediction of risk of stroke (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly [&amp;gt;65 years], Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) for prediction of risk for bleeding (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) in patients who have atrial fibrillation. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 4</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAFP strongly recommends that patients who have atrial fibrillation receive chronic anticoagulation unless they are at low risk of stroke (CHADS<sub>2</sub> &amp;lt;2) or have specific contraindications (<strong>strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). Choice of anticoagulation therapy should be based on patient preferences and patient history. Options for anticoagulation therapy may include warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 5</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAFP strongly recommends against dual treatment with anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in most patients who have atrial fibrillation (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>).</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;The AAFP uses a modified version of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). <br />
*Recommendations can be either for or against an intervention or testing modality.<br />
**The strength of the recommendation should be consistent with the quality of the evidence such that strong recommendations are based on high-quality evidence, whereas weak recommendations are based on low- to moderate-quality evidence. Very low-quality evidence should be considered insufficient for a recommendation unless there are highly unusual circumstances and the benefits would greatly outweigh the harms.</p>
<p><strong>Good Practice Point</strong> &amp;ndash; The GRADE system also provides opportunities to issue guideline recommendations without a rating when appropriate (e.g., those that will be helpful to a clinician but for which there is no direct evidence to support the recommendation).

<p>In 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published two comparative effectiveness reviews. The first report, <em>Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 119</em>, reviewed the evidence for pharmacologic and surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. The second review, <em>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 123</em>, reviewed the evidence for different anticoagulation strategies for patients with atrial fibrillation. These reports were based on literature searches from January 1, 2000, to August 14, 2012. Refer to the systematic reviews (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for search information and results.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Updated Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>A targeted, updated literature search using the same search criteria outlined in AHRQ reports was completed by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) medical librarian. The updated search resulted in 217 articles spanning the time from the completion of the AHRQ reports in 2012 through December 31, 2015. The search strategy is outlined in Appendix A of the original guideline document. Two reviewers independently examined citations and abstracts using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria that were used in the AHRQ evidence reports. A full text article was reviewed if at least one reviewer thought it should be included. This resulted in the review of 91 full text articles. Following exclusion of 48 articles, the remaining 43 articles underwent assessment for risk of bias and study quality. Each relevant study was rated for quality (good, fair, poor) by at least two independent reviewers using the approach outlined by the AHRQ <em>Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews</em>. In keeping with the AHRQ methods, only studies that were rated as good or fair were included for consideration. Studies rated as poor were not included. For this updated evidence review, 16 articles were included (see Appendix B in the original guideline). The updated literature search resulted in the inclusion of one additional RCT with a new medication (edoxaban) that was not addressed in the AHRQ report on stroke prevention. This RCT was used to inform Recommendation 4 on options for chronic anticoagulation. The other studies found in the updated search were observational and secondary analyses of RCTs included in the AHRQ reports. These additional studies did not change the conclusions from the original AHRQ evidence reports. However, these analyses were considered by the panel in determining the recommendations and are discussed in the guideline text as appropriate.</p></div>"/>

<p>This guideline updates and replaces an earlier guideline published in 2003 from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians, which was reaffirmed by the AAFP in 2008. The topic was nominated to the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for an updated evidence review in 2011. Changes in the methodology and scope of the guideline include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Adding a consumer/patient representative </li>
    <li>Including evidence for new direct oral anticoagulants </li>
    <li>Including evidence on strict versus lenient rate control </li>
    <li>Narrowing the scope of the guideline to focus solely on pharmacologic management </li>
    <li>Adding a recommendation on risk assessment for stroke </li>
    <li>Adding shared decision-making tools to compare treatment options for rate control and anticoagulation </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Systematic Review</strong></span></p>
<p>In 2013, AHRQ published two comparative effectiveness reviews. The first report, <em>Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 119</em>, reviewed the evidence for pharmacologic and surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. The second review, <em>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 123</em>, reviewed the evidence for different anticoagulation strategies for patients with atrial fibrillation. These reports were based on literature searches from January 1, 2000, to August 14, 2012.</p>
<p>The scope of the AHRQ reports was reviewed, and the panel chose to focus on the following key questions that they considered most relevant to primary care practice:</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key question (KQ) 1</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacological agents used for ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation? Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of these therapies differ among specific patient subgroups of interest?</p>
<p><strong>KQ2</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of a strict rate-control strategy versus a more lenient rate-control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation? Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of these therapies differ among specific patient subgroups of interest?</p>
<p><strong>KQ6</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of rate-control therapies compared with rhythm-control therapies in patients with atrial fibrillation? Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of these therapies differ among specific patient subgroups of interest?</p>
<p><strong>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation</strong></p>
<p><strong>KQ1</strong>: In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, what are the comparative diagnostic accuracy and impact on clinical decision making (diagnostic thinking, therapeutic, and patient outcome efficacy) of available clinical and imaging tools for predicting thromboembolic risk?</p>
<p><strong>KQ2</strong>: In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, what are the comparative diagnostic accuracy and impact on clinical decision making (diagnostic thinking, therapeutic, and patient outcome efficacy) of clinical tools and associated risk factors for predicting bleeding events?</p>
<p><strong>KQ3</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of specific anticoagulation therapies, antiplatelet therapies, and procedural interventions for preventing thromboembolic events:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;a&quot;>
    <li>In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation? </li>
    <li>In specific subpopulations of patients with nonvalvular fibrillation? </li>
</ol>
<p>The sections of the AHRQ evidence reports relevant to these key questions were reviewed and used as the foundation for the AAFP's recommendations.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Constructing the Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>The AAFP's Commission on Health of the Public and Science appointed a guideline development group (GDG) to update the guideline. Specifics on the guideline development panel and process can be found in the <em>AAFP Clinical Practice Guideline Manual</em> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The GDG reviewed the 2003 guideline and the two AHRQ evidence reports. The panel evaluated each recommendation from the guideline and determined those that would be included in the update. The GDG determined that the recommendations for pharmacologic treatment of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation were the most relevant for family physicians.</p>
<p>The evidence from the systematic reviews was evaluated using a modified version of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome and the overall strength of each recommendation. GRADE uses the term &quot;strength of recommendation&quot; to rate the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects and reflect the degree to which there is evidence of improved patient-oriented health outcomes (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). The GRADE system also provides opportunities to issue guideline recommendations without a rating when appropriate (e.g., those that will be helpful to a clinician but for which there is no direct evidence to support the recommendation). These statements are labeled by the AAFP as &quot;good practice points.&quot;</p>
<p>Guideline recommendations were finalized based on consensus of the GDG. Patient-oriented outcomes were prioritized in the guideline recommendations. Outcomes assessed included maintenance of ventricular rate and sinus rhythm; symptom relief; quality of life; all-cause and cardiovascular mortality; stroke; systemic embolism; cardiovascular events; hospitalizations; major and minor bleeding; and other adverse events due to medications. The recommendations were worded to reflect the strength and direction of the recommendation, and the quality of the evidence was listed parenthetically.</p></div>"/>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;The AAFP uses a modified version of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). <br />
*Recommendations can be either for or against an intervention or testing modality.<br />
**The strength of the recommendation should be consistent with the quality of the evidence such that strong recommendations are based on high-quality evidence, whereas weak recommendations are based on low- to moderate-quality evidence. Very low-quality evidence should be considered insufficient for a recommendation unless there are highly unusual circumstances and the benefits would greatly outweigh the harms.</p>
