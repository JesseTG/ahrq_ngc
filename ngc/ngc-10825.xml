	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I</strong>-<strong>IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Practice Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Given the lack of literature directly relevant to congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) for some of the clinical questions, some of the following recommendations are based in part on evidence from other neuromuscular disorders of childhood.</p>
<p><strong>General Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Patients with CMD may develop various combinations of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/nutritional, neurologic, ophthalmologic, orthopedic, and pulmonary manifestations. Multidisciplinary teams are recommended in the care of patients with complex neuromuscular conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuromuscular specialists, particularly child neurologists and psychiatrists with sub-specialty training, are key members of such teams, as are physicians from other specialties (e.g., cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, pulmonology) and allied health professionals with relevant expertise (e.g., dietitians, genetic counselors, nurses, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech-language pathologists).</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians caring for children with CMD should consult a pediatric neuromuscular specialist for diagnosis and management (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Pediatric neuromuscular specialists should coordinate the multidisciplinary care of patients with CMD when such resources are accessible to interested families (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>When genetic counselors are available to help families understand genetic test results and make family-planning decisions, physicians caring for patients with CMD might help families access such resources (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use of Clinical Features, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Muscle Biopsy in Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Patients with some of the classic CMD subtypes, including collagenopathies and dystroglycanopathies, have distinct phenotypic features that may help focus the diagnostic process.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should use relevant clinical features such as ethnicity and geographic location, patterns of weakness and contractures, the presence or absence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, the timing and severity of other organ involvement, and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels to guide diagnosis in collagenopathies and in dystroglycanopathies (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p>Interpretation of muscle biopsy findings, especially in children, is heavily dependent on technique and the experience of the pathologist or neuromuscular specialist who interprets the studies. Proper interpretation of these studies requires knowledge of the clinical context as well as availability of advanced testing capabilities. The knowledge obtained from a muscle biopsy may help families and providers better understand the disease process affecting specific patients.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians might order muscle biopsies that include immunohistochemical staining for relevant proteins in CMD cases for which the subtype-specific diagnosis is not apparent after initial diagnostic studies, if the risk associated with general anesthesia is determined to be acceptable (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>When muscle biopsies are indicated in cases of suspected CMD, they should be performed and interpreted at centers experienced in this test modality. In some cases, optimal diagnostic information may be derived when the biopsy is performed at one center and interpreted at another (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p>Typical brain MRI findings of white matter abnormalities in merosinopathies can be found consistently above the age of 6 months, and the structural brain abnormalities that often accompany the dystroglycanopathies are well documented.</p>
<p>Muscle ultrasound and MRI studies can help distinguish neurogenic from myopathic disorders and show pathognomonic patterns for specific CMD subtypes. Muscle MRI studies likewise can help identify CMD subtypes, including collagenopathies and selenoprotein 1 (<em>SEPN1</em>)-related myopathies.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should order brain MRI scans to assist with the diagnosis of patients with clinically suspected CMD subtypes such as merosinopathies and dystroglycanopathies, if the potential risk associated with any sedation is determined to be acceptable and if a radiologist or other physician with the appropriate expertise is available to interpret the findings (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Physicians might order muscle imaging studies of the lower extremities for individuals with suspected CMD subtypes such as collagenopathies (ultrasound or MRI) and <em>SEPN1</em>-related myopathy (MRI), if the risk associated with any sedation needed is determined to be acceptable and if a radiologist or other physician with the appropriate expertise is available to interpret the findings (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Genetic Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Targeted genetic testing often identifies causative mutations in the classic CMD subtypes. However, the cost of traditional Sanger sequencing for some of the larger causative genes presents an obstacle to universal application of such sequencing, even though the testing is readily available. Genetic diagnoses are beneficial to the patient, as they often enable physicians to provide more accurate prognoses and facilitate genetic counseling and family-planning discussions, and may enable patients to become more aware of future clinical trials for which they may be eligible.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>When available and feasible, physicians might order targeted genetic testing for specific CMD subtypes that have well-characterized molecular causes (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p>This systematic review indicates that many patients with CMD do not have mutations in one of the currently known genes. The cost of next-generation sequencing (whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) is dropping rapidly, to the point where these technologies are now readily available to many researchers who seek novel causative disease genes.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In individuals with CMD who either do not have a mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic origins have not been well characterized, physicians might order whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Complications and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Patients with CMD experience a broad spectrum of respiratory, musculoskeletal, cognitive, and cardiac complications with variable tempo between individuals. Providers may, in appropriate circumstances, extrapolate from early-onset neuromuscular and neuromotor diseases for which consensus guidelines have been developed on the basis of both established principles of care and limited outcomes and intervention trials. There are currently no curative CMD subtype-specific interventions. Thus, all complication screening and interventions are intended to promote growth and potential development, mitigate cumulative morbidities, optimize function, and limit mortality while maximizing quality of life.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>At the time of diagnosis, the physician should advise families regarding areas of uncertainty such as clinical outcomes and the value of interventions as they pertain to both longevity and quality of life. Physicians should explain the multisystem implications of neuromuscular insufficiency and guide families as they make decisions regarding the monitoring for and treatment of CMD complications (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Respiratory Complications</strong></p>
<p>Patients with respiratory failure from neuromuscular-related weakness may experience conspicuous respiratory symptoms but often do not have symptoms such as dyspnea that precede the onset of respiratory failure. Noninvasive and invasive interventions are routinely utilized for children with CMD. Pulmonologists, critical care specialists, and respiratory therapists with pediatric training and experience with neuromuscular disorders are most likely to offer treatment options that optimize respiratory outcomes and minimize infection risks and complications.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should counsel families of patients with CMD that respiratory insufficiency and associated problems may be inconspicuous at the outset (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Physicians should monitor pulmonary function tests such as spirometry and oxygen saturation in the awake and sleep states of patients with CMD, with monitoring levels individualized on the basis of the child's clinical status (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Physicians should refer children with CMD to pulmonary or aerodigestive care teams, when available, that are experienced in managing the interface between oropharyngeal function, gastric reflux and dysmotility, and nutrition and respiratory systems, and can provide anticipatory guidance concerning trajectory, assessment modalities, complications, and potential interventions (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Complications from Dysphagia</strong></p>
<p>Patients with neuromuscular disorders often experience dysphagia (impaired swallowing), with implications for growth and nutrition. Swallowing dysfunction may manifest as failure to thrive and may also increase the risk of admission to critical care units and mortality. Dysphagia may be diagnosed through standard multidisciplinary evaluations and radiologic studies. Safe and adequate nutrition is necessary for optimal health, and thus the potential benefits of improved nutrition with a gastrostomy must be weighed against the potential risks associated with an invasive procedure.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Neuromuscular specialists should coordinate with primary care providers to follow nutrition and growth trajectories in patients with CMD (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For patients with CMD, physicians should order multidisciplinary evaluations with swallow therapists, gastroenterologists, and radiologists if there is evidence of failure to thrive or respiratory symptoms (or both) (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For patients with CMD, a multidisciplinary care team, taking into account medical and family considerations, should recommend gastrostomy placement with or without fundoplication in the appropriate circumstances (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cardiac Complications</strong></p>
<p>Patients with CMD experience both functional and structural cardiac complications, but the frequency of these for many of the subtypes is unknown. On the basis of more extensive experience with cardiac complications in Duchenne MD and Becker MD, cardiac involvement may be subclinical and evident only on echocardiography or electrocardiography (ECG) (or both) in the earlier stages; such involvement may be amenable to pharmacologic therapy.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should refer children with CMD, regardless of subtype, for a baseline cardiac evaluation. The intervals of further evaluations should depend on the results of the baseline evaluation and the subtype-specific diagnosis (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Periprocedural Complications</strong></p>
<p>Patients with neuromuscular diseases are at increased risk of periprocedural complications, including airway problems, suboptimal pain control, pulmonary complications, prolonged recovery times, and complications of bed rest and deconditioning.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Before any surgical interventions and general anesthesia in the setting of CMD, physicians should discuss the potential increased risk of complications with patients' families, because these factors may affect decision-making regarding consent to certain elective procedures (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>When children with CMD undergo procedures involving sedation or general anesthesia, physicians should monitor longer than usual in the immediate postoperative period to diagnose and treat respiratory, nutritional, mobility, and gastrointestinal mobility complications (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Musculoskeletal Complications</strong></p>
<p>Patients with CMD are at increased risk of musculoskeletal complications, including skeletal deformities and contractures. Range-of-motion exercises are straightforward interventions that generally do not involve significant risk, but the efficacy of such exercises has not been established. Data on the efficacy of bracing are also lacking for children with CMD. It is generally accepted that orthopedic surgical interventions such as heel cord&amp;ndash;lengthening procedures relieve tendon contractures at least in the short term; however, the long-term efficacy is unclear. Neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., botulinum toxin) can cause prolonged worsening of weakness in patients with neuromuscular diseases.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should refer to allied health professionals, including physical, occupational, and speech therapists; seating and mobility specialists; rehabilitation specialists; and orthopedic surgeons, to help maximize function and potentially slow the progression of musculoskeletal complications in children with CMD (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Physicians may recommend range-of-motion exercises, orthotic devices, heel cord-lengthening procedures, or a combination of these interventions for children with CMD in certain circumstances (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Physicians might avoid using neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., botulinum toxin) in patients with CMD, unless the contractures are determined to cause significantly greater impairment than would any potential worsening of weakness in the targeted muscle groups (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Educational Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Before school age, children at risk of developmental delays are eligible for early intervention services as federally mandated. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 guarantees children with disabilities a free and appropriate public education.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should refer children with CMD to special education advocates, developmental specialists, and education specialists when appropriate for individual circumstances (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>

<p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A <strong>Level R</strong> designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non&amp;minus;evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention. </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Analysis of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel found only a few large studies and a number of smaller studies, most likely because of the rareness of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and the fact that the available studies oftentimes focus on specific subtypes. The panel decided to include at least some smaller studies so as not to miss what likely would be a significant number of valuable data, and thus set a minimum sample size of only 2 unrelated families for inclusion and a minimum evidence level of Class III for either diagnostic or screening criteria. In the end, many of the smallest studies were excluded because they provided only low levels of evidence (Class IV); however, a small number of these studies contributed data that were not readily available in studies that were rated Class III or higher, and thus were included in the analysis.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline was developed in accordance with the processes outlined in the 2004 and 2011 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) process manuals (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). In July 2010, the AAN Guideline Development Subcommittee and the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Practice Issues Review Panel formed a panel of pediatric neurologists, a pediatric physiatrist, a pediatric critical care specialist, a patient advocate who also is a physician, and an AAN evidence-based medicine methodologist, selected to represent a range of expertise in congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs).</p>
<p>The guideline panel assessed the efficacy of various screening and diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions for the management of patients with suspected or definite CMD. The guideline seeks to answer the following clinical questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>For children with suspected CMD, how accurately do the (a) geographic location and ethnicity, (b) clinical features, (c) brain imaging findings, (d) muscle imaging findings, and (e) muscle biopsy findings predict the subtype-specific diagnosis? </li>
    <li>How often does genetic testing confirm a diagnosis of CMD? </li>
    <li>How often do patients with CMD experience cognitive, respiratory, and cardiac complications? </li>
    <li>Are there effective treatments for complications of CMD, including scoliosis and nutritional deficiencies? </li>
</ol>
<p>The panel formulated a rationale for recommendations based on the evidence systematically reviewed and stipulated axiomatic principles of care. This rationale is explained in a section which precedes each set of recommendations. From this rationale, the panel inferred corresponding actionable recommendations. A level of obligation was assigned to each recommendation using a modified Delphi process that considered the following prespecified domains: the confidence in the evidence systematically reviewed, the acceptability of axiomatic principles of care, the strength of indirect evidence, and the relative magnitude of benefit to harm. Additional factors explicitly considered by the panel that could modify the level of obligation include judgments regarding the importance of outcomes, cost of compliance to the recommendation relative to benefit, the availability of the intervention, and anticipated variations in patients' preferences. Appendix e-8 in the CMD Guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) presents the prespecified rules for determining the final level of obligation from these domains. The panel indicated the level of obligation using standard modal operators. <em>Must</em> corresponds to <em>Level A</em>, very strong recommendations; <em>should</em> to <em>Level B</em>, strong recommendations; and <em>might</em> to <em>Level C</em>, weak recommendations. Appendix e-9 in the CMD Guideline indicates the panel members' judgments supporting the level of obligation for each recommendation.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A <strong>Level R</strong> designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention. </li>

    <li>Interpretation of muscle biopsy findings, especially in children, is heavily dependent on technique and the experience of the pathologist or neuromuscular specialist who interprets the studies.

    <li>Range-of-motion exercises are straightforward interventions that generally do not involve significant risk, but the efficacy of such exercises has not been established. Data on the efficacy of bracing are also lacking for children with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). It is generally accepted that orthopedic surgical interventions such as heel cord-lengthening procedures relieve tendon contractures at least in the short term; however, the long-term efficacy is unclear. </li>
    <li>Safe and adequate nutrition is necessary for optimal health, and thus the potential benefits of improved nutrition with a gastrostomy must be weighed against the potential risks associated with an invasive procedure. </li>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) are committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN and AANEM keep separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN and AANEM limit the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN and AANEM forbid commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, at least one AANEM committee, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em> peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
