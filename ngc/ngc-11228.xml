	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This provisional clinical opinion (PCO) addresses the following main research question: Do second-line hormonal therapies play a role in the treatment of chemotherapy-na&amp;iuml;ve men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)?</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Should a castrate state be maintained in patients who develop CRPC?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 1</strong></p>
<p>For men who develop CRPC despite castrate levels of testosterone:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients should be maintained in a castrate state indefinitely. This PCO is based on indirect scientific evidence and current understandings of disease progression mechanisms in prostate cancer. A discussion with patients about the limited nature of available scientific evidence and the balance among potential harms, benefits, costs, and patient preferences is essential when planning treatment. </li>
    <li>A castrate state should be maintained through orchiectomy or pharmacologic castration (e.g., luteinizing hormone&amp;ndash;releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists/antagonists, antiandrogens). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In chemotherapy-naıve patients who develop CRPC but have no radiographic evidence of metastases (M0 CRPC), should second-line hormonal therapies be used? If so, what agents or specific sequence of agents should be offered?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 2</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For chemotherapy-na&amp;iuml;ve patients believed to be at low risk for metastases (low prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and slow PSA doubling time) (Pound et al., 1999; Scher et al., 2016), second-line hormonal therapies are not suggested. </li>
    <li>For chemotherapy-na&amp;iuml;ve patients at high risk of developing metastases (rapid PSA doubling time or velocity), second-line hormonal therapies that lower PSA values or slow the rate of PSA rise may be offered (preferably in a clinical trial setting where available) after discussion with the patient about limited scientific evidence, potential harms, benefits, costs, and patient preferences. </li>
    <li>Alternative treatment options include observation (with maintenance of a castrate state) or participation in a clinical trial. </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy or immunotherapy is not suggested except in a clinical trial. </li>
    <li>No evidence provides guidance about the optimal order of hormonal therapies after second-line hormonal therapy for high-risk chemotherapy-naıve patients with M0 CRPC. The panel was unable to come to consensus about sequencing. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In chemotherapy-na&amp;iuml;ve patients who develop CRPC and have radiographic evidence of metastases but minimal symptoms (M1a/ M1s CRPC), should second-line hormonal therapies be used? If so, what agents are recommended?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 3</strong></p>
<p>After first-line hormonal treatment failure and a discussion with chemotherapy-na&amp;iuml;ve patients about potential harms, benefits, costs, and patient preferences: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone should be offered because they significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as secondary end points, including median time to opiate use, chemotherapy initiation, performance status deterioration, and PSA progression (v prednisone alone). The drugs are also well tolerated. </li>
    <li>Enzalutamide should be offered because it significantly improves rPFS and OS. Secondary end points are also improved, including time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, risk of a first skeletal-related event, complete or partial soft tissue response, time to PSA progression, time to deterioration in quality of life, and decline in PSA of &amp;ge;50% from baseline (v placebo). The drug is also well tolerated. </li>
    <li>Alternative treatment options include immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T) (Kantoff et al., 2010), chemotherapy (docetaxel and prednisone) (Basch et al., 2014), and radium-223. </li>
    <li>If none of these therapies can be obtained or tolerated by the patient, other antiandrogens, prednisone, and ketoconazole/hydrocortisone may be offered because they provide modest clinical benefits in this population, but no survival benefits have been established. </li>
    <li>Other alternative treatment options include enrollment in a clinical trial and observation. </li>
    <li>No evidence provides guidance about the optimal order of hormonal therapies after second-line hormonal therapy for patients with M1 CRPC. The panel was unable to come to a consensus about sequencing. </li>
    <li>Other second-line hormonal therapy options where results from phase III trials are pending are not suggested. </li>
    <li>Palliative care should be offered to all chemotherapy-naıve men with M1 CRPC, particularly to those who exhibit symptoms or decreased quality of life (refer to the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the ASCO guideline <a href=&quot;/summaries/summary/50609/&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #11128&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Integration of palliative care into standard oncology care: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>How often should patients with CRPC undergo PSA monitoring?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 4</strong></p>
<p>No evidence provides guidance about the optimal frequency of PSA monitoring before starting second-line hormonal therapy or after treatment has begun.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For patients with no radiographic evidence of metastases and a slow PSA doubling time (Pound et al., 1999; Scher et al., 2016) or velocity, a PSA evaluation every 4 to 6 months is reasonable. If PSA levels rise, checking serum testosterone levels should be considered. </li>
    <li>For patients with a rapid PSA doubling time, velocity, or radiographic evidence of metastases, a PSA evaluation every 3 months is reasonable. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>What imaging modalities are appropriate for patients with CRPC?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 5</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>When imaging is considered for patients both before and while receiving treatment, a bone scan and either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis are reasonable. </li>
    <li>Imaging with fluorine-18 (<sup>18</sup>F)-labeled positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FPET) generally is not recommended because it is currently only approved in the United States for the diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer among men with elevated PSA after treatment. The use of this technique is otherwise limited to patients who participate in clinical trials and prospective registries. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>How often should patients with CRPC undergo radiographic imaging or routine radiographic restaging?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 6</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Radiographic imaging is not indicated for men with rising PSA unless treatment selection would be altered on the basis of radiographic findings or if symptoms potentially attributed to prostate cancer develop or worsen (e.g., bone pain). </li>
    <li>Routine radiographic restaging generally is not recommended, except among patients in whom PSA is not a reliable marker of disease. </li>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) are based in part on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this PCO was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Genitourinary Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>PCO Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>This PCO was informed by a systematic review of the available evidence, consensus opinion, and clinical experience. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Chemotherapy-naive men with nonmetastatic or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who were being considered for second-line hormonal therapy </li>
    <li>Measured effect of continued hormonal interventions in patients with CRPC for at least one primary measure of therapeutic efficacy, such as radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression or time to progression in general, and median duration of response </li>
    <li>A minimum of 25 patients per trial arm </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; and (3) published in a non-English language. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The search included the MEDLINE (PubMed: 1985 through June 2015), and Cochrane Library databases to May 31, 2014). Conference proceedings from the 2010&amp;ndash;2015 ASCO Annual and Genitourinary meetings were also searched for randomized controlled trials reporting on outcomes of interest. Reference lists of seminal papers and recent review articles were scanned for additional citations. Literature search terms included castration-resistant prostate cancer, androgen-independent prostate cancer, and hormone therapy. Further details on the search strategy and results are provided in the accompanying Data Supplement 1 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Search results were reviewed by the Practice Guidelines Specialist and papers deemed eligible for full text review were obtained and data were extracted. These data were also reviewed by the lead authors and audited by a second American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the lead authors if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified. For the ASCO quality assessment, design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as &quot;low,&quot; &quot;intermediate,&quot; or &quot;high&quot; for the identified evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quality Assessment of the Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>The modest number of randomly assigned patients in the majority of the identified trials created obstacles with respect to determination of the true efficacy or generalizability of the findings. An additional challenge with the data identified by the systematic review was the lack of similar treatment arms; no two trials included the same comparisons. The largest trial included 1,717 participants. However, most of the remaining trials included fewer than 140 patients per comparison arm. The trial of abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-naive patients reported significant progression-free survival (PFS) results, which led to the trial being stopped early. The enzalutamide trial in chemotherapy-naive patients also reported a PFS advantage and was stopped early. Patients were offered crossover in both studies.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel that comprised prostate cancer experts with specific knowledge in and clinical experience with CRPC, including specialists from medical oncology, urologic oncology, radiation oncology, and guideline methodology. Academic and community practitioners were represented as were patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Expert Panel, the ASCO CPGC also convened a Consensus Panel, with similar representation to the Expert Panel, tasked with rating agreement with the drafted provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) by using ASCO's formal consensus-based methodology. This approach is based on the modified Delphi consensus development methodology for providing clinical guidance when available data do not support more traditional and definitive evidence-based recommendations. Results of the consensus ratings can be found in Data Supplement 8 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>PCO Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel, who met via teleconference and corresponded through email, was asked to contribute to the development of the PCO, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the PCO in consideration of the evidence. The Expert Panel was supplemented by additional experts recruited to rate their agreement with the drafted PCOs as part of the consensus process. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. The Expert Panel and ASCO staff prepared the draft PCOs for review and rating by the Consensus Panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of the PCO</span></strong></p>
<p>The PCOs were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software<sup>TM</sup>. This method helps panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable guidance using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The clinical practice guidelines and other guidance published herein are provided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc (ASCO), to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information therein should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like &quot;must,&quot; &quot;must not&quot; &quot;should,&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; indicate that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information or for any errors or omissions. </li>
