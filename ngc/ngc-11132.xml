	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original document provides guidance for hand hygiene and surgical hand antisepsis in the perioperative setting. Hand hygiene is widely recognized as a primary method to prevent health care-associated infections and the transmission of pathogens in the health care setting. Health care-associated infections can result in untoward patient outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality, pain and suffering, longer lengths of hospital stay, delayed wound healing, increased use of antibiotics, and higher costs of care. Thus, prevention of health care-associated infections is a priority for all health care personnel. Hand hygiene and surgical hand antisepsis are effective and cost-efficient ways to prevent and control infections in the perioperative setting.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot;>
    <li>All perioperative team members should maintain healthy fingernail and hand skin condition. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should not wear jewelry (e.g., rings, watches, bracelets) on the hands or wrists. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should perform hand hygiene (Ellingson et al., 2014; World Health Organization [WHO], 2009; Boyce &amp;amp; Pittet, 2002). </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should perform surgical hand antisepsis before donning sterile gowns and gloves for operative and other invasive procedures (Ellingson et al., 2014; WHO, 2009; Boyce &amp;amp; Pittet, 2002; &quot;AST Standards,&quot; 2008; Adams, 2010). </li>
    <li>A multidisciplinary team should select hand hygiene products to be used in the perioperative setting following an analysis of product effectiveness, user acceptance, and cost (WHO, 2009). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in a variety of quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the facility or health care organization plan to improve understanding and compliance with the principles and processes of hand hygiene. </li>

<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases Ovid MEDLINE&amp;reg;, EBSCO CINAHL&amp;reg; Scopus&amp;reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was limited to literature published in English from January 2010 through September 2015. Between September 2015 and February 2016, the results of alerts established at the time of the initial search were assessed, and the lead author requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. Finally, the lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies, professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>The search was limited to the concept of hand hygiene to the perioperative setting. Hand hygiene search terms included the subject headings <em>handwashing</em> and <em>hand disinfection</em>, supplemented by the keywords <em>hand washing, handwashing, hand hygiene, hand antisepsis, hand contamination,</em> and <em>hand decontamination</em>. Search terms related to the perioperative setting included the subject headings <em>operating rooms, surgicenters, anesthesia, perioperative care, perioperative period, perioperative nursing,</em> and <em>operating room personnel</em> and keywords such as <em>operating theater, surgical suite, operating suite,</em> and <em>perioperative setting</em>. To retrieve additional relevant articles, the keywords <em>surgical, preoperative, preoperative, presurgical,</em> and&amp;lt; em&amp;gt;pre-surgical were combined with the keywords <em>hand antisepsis, wash, scrub, rub, </em>and<em> hand preparation</em>. Subject headings and keywords for cross-contamination and infection, fingernails and jewelry, skin irritation and inflammation, and specific antiseptic agents and products also were included.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and literature on hand hygiene in patient care settings other than the perioperative setting. Editorials, news, and brief items were excluded. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher-quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America/Infectious Diseases Society of America (SHEA/IDSA) recommend avoiding hand washing in hot water because repeated exposure to <br />
    hot water can irritate the skin and may lead to dermatitis or bacterial colonization. </li>
    <li>The SHEA/IDSA recommends avoiding use of soaps containing the antiseptic triclosan in the health care setting due to an assessment of benefits and harms. Evidence is lacking to establish clinical benefit from use of triclosan compared to other antiseptics. The harms of triclosan may include environmental contamination and the potential for development of bacterial resistance. </li>
    <li>The WHO and the CDC recommend reviewing information from the manufacturer regarding any known interactions between products used to clean hands, skin care products, and gloves. Oil-containing lotions have been associated with altered integrity of latex rubber gloves, reduced persistent effects of hand antiseptics, and bacterial contamination of the lotion. </li>
    <li>Patients may be especially sensitive to the fragrance of hand hygiene products. </li>
    <li>The WHO recommends avoiding the testing of new hand hygiene products during seasons of low humidity because health care personnel may have more skin reactions in this weather and the results of the end-user evaluation could be affected by this seasonal variation. In a European field study, researchers investigated factors that influenced the testing of alcohol-based hand rubs and found that test periods during colder seasons were significantly associated with skin reactions. </li>
    <li>The SHEA/IDSA recommends conducting a point-of-care risk assessment to guide placement of dispensers. Based on the risk assessment, the health care organization may decide to provide patients and visitors with nontoxic hand hygiene products because cognitively impaired, behavioral health, or substance abuse patients may be injured by ingestion of alcohol-based hand rub. </li>
    <li>The WHO also recommends careful consideration for placement of dispensers in areas with patients who are likely to ingest the product, such as disoriented elderly patients, psychiatric patients, young children, or patients with alcohol dependence. </li>
