	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the overall quality of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, or <strong>very low/insufficient</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Synovial fluid analysis has been the reference standard for gout diagnosis. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of acute gout may result in unnecessary surgery; hospitalization; delays in adequate treatment, such as antibiotics for septic joints; and unnecessary prescribing of long-term treatment. In the absence of an evidence-based alternative, joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis should be done if the joint can be aspirated without substantial patient discomfort by an experienced clinician who can minimize the risk for infection; a reliable, accurate source (including a polarizing microscope and a trained operator) is available to detect the presence of urate crystals; the clinical situation is ambiguous; and a significant probability of infection exists.</p>
<p>If these criteria cannot be met, the clinician should either refer the patient to a source that can meet the criteria or use his or her clinical judgment. Clinical judgment is especially appropriate in situations that are less clinically ambiguous and where there is not a significant probability of infection. For example, joint aspiration would not be essential in a patient with podagra, a history of appropriate risk factors (such as age), and no sign of an overlying skin wound. This patient may appropriately be considered to have gout and treated appropriately (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the ACP guideline <a href=&quot;/summaries/summary/50608/&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #11127&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Management of acute and recurrent gout</a>). The current evidence is insufficient to recommend a single clinical algorithm for diagnosing gout. However, several promising algorithms showed sensitivities and specificities greater than 80%. Current evidence is insufficient to support the use of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) or ultrasonography to diagnose acute gout.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched, without language restrictions, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, gray literature, and the Web of Science from inception through 29 February 2016 using the word gout combined with the terms for diagnostic methods (<em>monosodium urate [MSU] crystal analysis</em>, <em>joint aspiration</em>, <em>dual-energy computed tomography [DECT]</em>, <em>ultrasound</em>, and <em>x-ray</em>), clinical signs and symptoms, and outcome measures, without filters specific for the diagnostic tests, as recommended. Supplement Table 1 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) shows the search methodology. The reviewers also obtained relevant references from a search conducted for a simultaneous review on gout management, considered studies suggested by experts, searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the Web of Science for recently completed studies and unpublished or non&amp;ndash;peer-reviewed study findings, and contacted manufacturers of equipment and laboratory test kits used to diagnose gout for unpublished data specific to their use for gout diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Titles and abstracts identified by the literature searches were screened by 2 reviewers, who independently conducted a full-text review of all selections to exclude articles that reported only on the incidence or prevalence, risk factors, or treatment of gout; included persons younger than 18 years; provided no usable data (sensitivities and specificities or data that could be used to calculate them); reported the same data as another article; enrolled only participants with established gout diagnoses; or did not clearly indicate the use of a recognized diagnostic standard. If necessary, disagreements regarding inclusion at the full-text stage were reconciled with the project leader's input. The reviewers included original prospective and cross-sectional studies that assessed the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) or safety of tests used to diagnose gout in persons with no prior definitive gout diagnosis who presented with joint inflammation, and in which the reference standard was MSU analysis or a combination of MSU analysis, American Rheumatism Association (ARA) (now the American College of Rheumatology [ACR]) criteria for gout diagnosis, and tests to confirm or rule out other causes of inflammatory arthritis. Studies that enrolled patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia were excluded. To assess safety, reviewers also included case reports and case series. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the AHRQ report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers abstracted study-level details from articles accepted for inclusion. Outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value [PPV and NPV]) were singly abstracted and verified by another reviewer. Risk of bias (study quality) of each included study was assessed independently by 2 reviewers using the QUADAS-2 (Revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool. Supplement Table 2 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) includes the results of the quality assessment. Disagreements regarding study details were reconciled by group discussion, and those related to study quality were mediated by the project leader.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers organized the narrative descriptions of evidence, which focused on study quality, settings, and findings, according to categories of tests, as well as chronologically. If several studies compared similar tests with the same reference standard, reviewers used bivariate metaregression to pool studies. As a group, the reviewers assessed the overall strength of evidence (SOE) for each major comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low, or insufficient using guidance suggested by the Effective Health Care Program.</p></div>"/>

    <li>What is the accuracy of clinical signs and symptoms and other diagnostic tests (such as serum urate, ultrasonography, computed tomography, dual-energy computed tomography [DECT], and plain radiography), alone or in combination, compared with synovial fluid analysis in diagnosing acute gouty arthritis, and how does the accuracy affect clinical decision making, clinical outcomes and complications, and patient-centered outcomes? </li>
    <li>How does the diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs and symptoms and other tests vary by affected joint site and number of joints? </li>
    <li>Does the accuracy of diagnostic tests for gout vary by duration of symptoms (that is, time from the beginning of a flare)? </li>
    <li>Does the accuracy of synovial fluid aspiration and crystal analysis differ by the type of practitioner who is performing the aspiration or the crystal analysis? </li>
