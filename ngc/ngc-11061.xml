	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there an optimal (defined throughout this guideline as treatments with demonstrated benefits in both treatment-related and quality-of-life outcomes) first-line endocrine therapy regimen for hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC)?</p>
<p><strong>Question 1.1 </strong></p>
<p>For postmenopausal women: What are the optimal sequence and duration?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em></p>
<p>Postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC should be offered aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as first-line endocrine therapy (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 1.2</strong></p>
<p>Should hormone therapy be administered in combination with other hormonal agents or chemotherapy?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em></p>
<p>Combination hormone therapy with fulvestrant, with a loading dose followed by 500 mg every 28 days, plus a nonsteroidal AI may be offered to patients with MBC without prior exposure to adjuvant endocrine therapy (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong>Question 1.3</strong></p>
<p>For premenopausal women: What is the optimal timing of ovarian suppression or ablation? Should all patients have their ovaries suppressed? What is the best partner hormonal agent in this setting?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em></p>
<p>Premenopausal women with HR-positive MBC should be offered ovarian suppression or ablation in combination with hormone therapy. Ovarian suppression with either gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or ablation with oophorectomy seems to achieve similar results in MBC. For most patients, clinicians should use guidelines for postmenopausal women to guide the choice of hormone treatment, although sequential therapy can also be considered. Patients without exposure to prior hormone therapy can also be treated with tamoxifen or ovarian suppression or ablation alone, although combination therapy is preferred (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). Treatment should be on the basis of the biology of the tumor and the menopausal status of the patient, with careful attention paid to production of ovarian estrogen (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 1.4</strong></p>
<p>Are there demonstrated differences between pre- and postmenopausal patients?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em></p>
<p>Treatment should take into account the biology of the tumor and the menopausal status of the patient, with careful attention paid to ovarian production of estrogen (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document) (Type: evidence and consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there an optimal second-line or later endocrine therapy for HR-positive MBC?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2.1</strong></p>
<p>Should other treatment or disease-free interval play a role in treatment selection?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em></p>
<p>The choice of second-line hormone therapy should take into account prior treatment exposure and response to previous endocrine therapy (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2.2</strong></p>
<p>Which hormone therapy should be offered?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em></p>
<p>Sequential hormone therapy should be offered to patients with endocrine-responsive disease. Options are shown in Figure 1 in the original guideline document (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2.3</strong></p>
<p>What are the optimal timing, dose, schedule, and duration of treatment?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.3</em></p>
<p>Fulvestrant should be administered using the 500-mg dose and with a loading schedule (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>How or should endocrine therapies be used in combination or sequence with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus) or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib)?</p>
<p><strong>Question 3.1</strong></p>
<p>How or should endocrine therapies be used in combination or sequence with mTOR inhibitors?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em></p>
<p>Exemestane and everolimus may be offered to postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC who experience progression during treatment with nonsteroidal AIs, either before or after treatment with fulvestrant, because progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) was improved compared with exemestane alone. Other options are shown in Figures 1 and 2 in the original guideline document. This combination should not be offered as first-line therapy for patients who experience relapse &amp;gt;12 months from prior nonsteroidal AI therapy or for those who are na&amp;iuml;ve to hormone therapy (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 3.2</strong></p>
<p>How or should endocrine therapies be used in combination or sequence with CDK 4/6 inhibitors?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em></p>
<p>A nonsteroidal AI and palbociclib may be offered to postmenopausal women with treatment-na&amp;iuml;ve HR-positive MBC; PFS but not OS was improved compared with the nonsteroidal AI letrozole alone. Other options are shown in Figures 1 and 2 in the original guideline document. The accelerated approval of palbociclib is dependent on results of an ongoing phase III trial in the same setting (see online Data Supplement 8; PALOMA-2 trial [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Results from the PALOMA-2 trial will be presented at the ASCO 2016 Annual Meeting. A <a href=&quot;http://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_presents_data_from_paloma_2_phase_3_study_demonstrating_clinical_benefit_of_ibrance_palbociclib_in_asian_women_with_er_her2_metastatic_breast_cancer_at_esmo_asia_congress&quot; title=&quot;Pfizer Web site&quot;>press release</a> confirms that the trial met its primary end point. Letrozole plus palbociclib improved PFS compared with letrozole alone as first-line therapy for HR-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Survival data are not yet available.</p>
<p>Palbociclib may also be offered in combination with fulvestrant in patients exposed to prior hormone therapy and up to one line of chemotherapy, on the basis of data from the phase III PALOMA-3 trial. PFS was improved compared with fulvestrant alone; OS data are immature (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate; Strength of recommendation: intermediate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>Does estrogen or progesterone expression (high versus low expression) affect hormone therapy considerations and modify recommendations for hormone therapy&amp;mdash;either the recommended agents or dosing details&amp;mdash;among pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em></p>
<p>Hormone therapy should be offered to patients whose tumors express any level of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) (Type: evidence and consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>How does adjuvant treatment affect recommendations for treatment in the metastatic or advanced setting?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5</em></p>
<p>Treatment recommendations should be offered on the basis of type of adjuvant treatment, disease-free interval, and extent of disease at the time of recurrence (see Figures 1 and 2 in the original guideline document). A specific hormonal agent may be used again if recurrence occurs &amp;gt;12 months from last treatment (Type: evidence and consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>In which patients or settings is hormone therapy recommended over chemotherapy?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6</em></p>
<p>Endocrine therapy should be recommended as initial treatment for patients with HR-positive MBC, except for patients with immediately life-threatening disease or for those who experience rapid visceral recurrence during adjuvant endocrine therapy (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 6.1</strong></p>
<p>Is there a role for combined cytotoxic and endocrine therapies?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.1</em></p>
<p>The use of combined endocrine therapy and chemotherapy is not recommended (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Question 6.2</strong></p>
<p>What is the optimal duration of treatment with hormone therapy?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.2</em></p>
<p>Treatment should be administered until there is unequivocal evidence of disease progression as documented by imaging, clinical examination, or disease-related symptoms. Tumor markers or circulating tumor cells should not be used as the sole criteria for determining progression (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a role for additional biomarkers in the selection of treatment for patients for HR-positive disease?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em></p>
<p>Use of additional biomarkers is experimental and should be reserved for selection of treatment in clinical trials. There is no routine clinical role for genomic or expression profiling in the selection of treatment for HR-positive MBC (Type: consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 7.1</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the role of genomic profiling or intrinsic subtypes in this population?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7.1</em></p>
<p>Genomic or expression profiling should not be used to select treatment for HR-positive MBC (Type: consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p>How does human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity affect treatment of patients with HR-positive MBC?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8</em></p>
<p>The addition of HER2-targeted therapy to first-line AIs should be offered to patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive MBC in whom chemotherapy is not immediately indicated. The addition of HER2-targeted therapy to first-line AIs improved PFS, without a demonstrated improvement in OS. HER2-targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy resulted in improvements in OS and is the preferred first-line approach in most cases (Type: evidence and consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p>What are the future directions for treatment in this patient population?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9</em></p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to consider enrolling in clinical trials, including those receiving treatment in the first-line setting. Multiple clinical trials are ongoing or planned, with a focus on improving response to hormone therapy in metastatic disease (Type: evidence and consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews. A protocol for each guideline defines the parameters for a targeted literature search, including relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespecified study selection criteria for literature identified.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE (OVID: 2008 through week 4 of April 2014) and Cochrane Library databases (<a href=&quot;http://www.cochranelibrary.com&quot; title=&quot;Cochrane Library Web site&quot;>http://www.cochranelibrary.com</a>; to Issue 3 of March 2013) were searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. Additionally, the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (2011 to 2014) and ASCO abstracts (2012 to 2014) were searched for reports on systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) and randomized controlled trials (phase II or III) using the keywords &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;metastatic&quot; and were reviewed for terms relating to hormone receptor (HR) status, publication type, and study design. Reference lists from seminal papers and recent review articles were scanned for additional citations, and known updates of included evidence were obtained as available. A targeted literature search update was performed in June 2015 to obtain the most recent evidence. The literature search strategy used in the MEDLINE database is available in Data Supplement 1 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they were fully published or abstract reports of systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) or randomized controlled trials (phase II or III), published in English, that reported on any of the following interventions: endocrine therapies, including selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (tamoxifen or toremifene), ER downregulators (fulvestrant), progestins (megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone), luteinizing hormone&amp;ndash;releasing hormone analogs (goserelin, leuprorelin, or buserelin), nonsteroidal third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (anastrozole or letrozole), and steroidal third-generation AIs (exemestane); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus or temsirolimus); cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib); estrogens; and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Selected articles made any of the following comparisons: single-agent versus single-agent hormone therapies, single-agent versus combination endocrine therapies, endocrine therapy with or without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies, endocrine therapy with or without mTOR inhibitors, endocrine therapy with or without CDK 4/6 inhibitors, and endocrine therapy with or without novel agents. Articles were also required to report on primary outcomes of interest (including overall survival [OS], progression free survival [PFS] or time to progression [TTP], or clinical benefit rate [CBR; stable disease plus response rate]) or secondary outcomes of interest (including time to initiation of chemotherapy, toxicity, or quality of life [QoL] as measured by a validated, reliable instrument [e.g., Short Form Health Survey 36]). Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were noncomparative studies.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Expert Panel members, who met face to face and via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail, were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based on consideration of the evidence. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for drafting the penultimate version of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz&amp;trade; software. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality, to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

<p>The guideline panel understands that the treatment of metastatic cancer is complicated by the cost of treatment and that this may limit options in some situations. The use of combination hormone therapy, particularly with targeted agents, clearly adds both the cost of acquiring the agents as well as the cost of managing adverse effects. This guideline outlines the optimal treatment approach without considering cost or availability in specific geographic areas of the world. Recommendations are on the basis of clinical trials, and limitations of existing data are outlined. This information should help with decision making when the cost of therapy limits access to specific treatments.</p></div>"/>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely throughout the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href=&quot;https://www.asco.org/practice-guidelines/quality-guidelines/implementation-strategy&quot; title=&quot;ASCO Web site&quot;>ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology and Journal of Oncology Practice</em>. Treatments that control symptoms, delay the onset of chemotherapy, and delay progression of disease should be emphasized within the contexts of cost and toxicity.</p>
