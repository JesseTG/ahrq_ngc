	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for level of evidence (<strong>IA, IB, II, III, IV</strong>) and strength of recommendation (<strong>Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the Major Recommendations field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Preamble</span></strong></p>
<p>Multigene profiling assays are used in combination with clinical-pathological factors in invasive breast cancer patients to ascertain whether a patient's estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumour has an intrinsic high-risk or low-risk profile. Oncotype DX, Prosigna, and EndoPredict are examples of assays that are commercially available in Ontario. Although no assay represents a gold standard, Oncotype DX is supported by the widest range of evidence for prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit, while both Prosigna and EndoPredict have evidence-based validity in providing some of the same or similar clinical information. Figure 1-1 in the original guideline document graphically summarizes the included recommendations in a decision tree format for clinical use. At the time of publication, Oncotype DX is the only assay that is publically funded in Ontario.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Given that there are now multiple multigene assays that can predict for recurrence in patients with invasive breast cancer, what is the level of evidence supporting the clinical validity and utility for each of these assays?</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Given that Oncotype DX is part of standard practice in Ontario, what is the evidence that other assays can complement or replace Oncotype DX for certain clinical utilities? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may offer multigene profile assay testing to potential chemotherapy candidates with invasive breast carcinoma that is ER-positive/HER2-negative (<strong>Recommendation Type: Evidence-based; Evidence Quality: Level IB; Recommendation Strength: Moderate</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients with node-negative ER-positive/HER2-negative disease, clinicians may use a low-risk result from Oncotype DX, Prosigna, or EndoPredict/EPclin assays to support a decision to withhold chemotherapy (<strong>Recommendation Type: Evidence-based; Evidence Quality: Level IB; Recommendation Strength: Moderate</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients with node-negative ER-positive/HER2-negative disease, clinicians may use a high-risk result from Oncotype DX to support a decision to offer chemotherapy. A high-risk Oncotype DX result in this subpopulation has been associated with both poor prognosis without chemotherapy, and a prediction of benefit from giving chemotherapy (<strong>Recommendation Type: Evidence-based; Evidence Quality: Level IB-II; Recommendation Strength: Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 4</span></strong></p>
<p>In some patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative tumours and 1 to 3 nodes involved (N1a disease), clinicians may withhold chemotherapy based on a low-risk Oncotype DX or Prosigna score if the decision is supported by other clinical, pathological, or patient-related factors (<strong>Recommendation Type: Consensus-based; Evidence Quality: Level II; Recommendation Strength: Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation 5</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients with ER-positive disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of multigene profiling assays to inform clinical decision making for late risk of recurrence. A high-risk score using Prosigna or EndoPredict prognosticates for late recurrence; however, evidence is lacking that these tests predict for benefit of extended adjuvant endocrine treatment beyond five years. (<strong>Recommendation Type: Consensus-based; Evidence Quality: Lack of evidence; Recommendation Strength: Weak</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The rating scheme for the strength of recommendations is specific to this particular guideline because the subject is one that has not been studied much methodologically (e.g., recommendations on molecular tests). The rule was that if there was level I evidence (according to the scheme laid out by Simon et al.) it was a moderate-strength recommendation, and otherwise it was weak. Given the nature of topic and the type of evidence involved, the authors believed that strong recommendations were for the most part impossible.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This evidence review was conducted in two planned stages, including a search for systematic reviews followed by a search for primary literature.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search for Existing Systematic Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p>A search was conducted for existing systematic reviews. Systematic reviews published as a component of practice guidelines were also considered eligible for inclusion. An electronic search employing OVID was used to systematically search the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for systematic reviews evaluating the clinical utility of Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Prosigna/PAM50, and EndoPredict. OVID was searched from 2002 to week 31 of 2015 using the following keywords: &quot;oncotype&quot;, &quot;21 gene&quot;, &quot;recurrence score&quot;, &quot;prosigna&quot;, &quot;pam50&quot;, &quot;mammaprint&quot;, &quot;70 gene&quot;, and &quot;endopredict&quot;. In addition, Web sites/databases of specific guideline developers that used systematic review as their evidentiary base, as well as systematic review producers, were also searched, using the same keywords and for the same time period. These Web sites/databases included: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</p>
<p>Identified systematic reviews were evaluated based on their clinical content and relevance. Relevant systematic reviews were assessed using the 11-item Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool to determine whether existing systematic reviews met a minimum threshold for methodological quality and could be considered for inclusion in the evidence base.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search for Primary Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>Below are methods for locating and evaluating primary literature if no existing systematic reviews were identified, or if identified reviews were incomplete in some fashion. If the identified systematic reviews are incomplete, then the primary literature review might be reduced in scope (e.g., subject areas covered, time frames covered).</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>OVID was used to systematically search the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating the clinical utility of multigene profiling assays, published between 2002 and week 7 of 2016. The literature search strategy included keywords for identification of the multigene assays of interest, as well as keywords to identify important clinical utility and clinical validation studies that were known a priori. The complete literature search strategy can be found in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document. In addition to the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases searches, reference lists of included systematic reviews and primary literature were scanned for potentially useful studies.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria and Process</strong></p>
<p>Identified studies that used prospectively enrolled patients and prospectively collected tumour specimens were considered for inclusion in the evidentiary base of this systematic review. Retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, letters, editorials, and studies not published in English were excluded from the evidentiary base. The literature search flow diagram can be found in Appendix 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>All hits from the OVID literature search were input into reference management software (EndNote X6), where duplicate citations were removed. A review of the titles and abstracts that resulted from the search was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second. For those items that warranted full-text review, one reviewer determined whether the inclusion and exclusion criteria were met. The list of proposed studies was verified by the Working Group.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Results</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search for Existing Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The search for existing systematic reviews identified five publications that were considered for inclusion after full-text review. Although all of the identified reviews evaluated the clinical utility of one or more multigene profiling assays, none fully addressed the objectives of the systematic review. Since the literature base in this field is small and the reviewers sought to assess the primary literature based on the level of evidence (LoE) framework, none of the identified systematic reviews were incorporated.</p>
<p><strong>Search for Primary Literature</strong></p>
<p>Twenty-four studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria (see Appendix 3 in the original guideline document). Seventeen studies focused on the clinical utility of the multigene profiling assays and seven studies focused on a change in treatment plan. Table 3-1 in the original guideline document summarizes the number of studies that evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of each assay, stratified by the level of evidence for those studies. Table 3-2 in the original guideline document summarizes the number of studies that assessed a change in chemotherapy treatment based on the results of an assay.</p></div>"/>

<p>Data were extracted from all studies that passed full-text review by one reviewer. Ratios, including hazard ratios, were expressed with a ratio &amp;lt;1.0 indicating reduced risk for recurrence or death, unless otherwise indicated. All extracted data and information were audited by an independent auditor.</p>
<p>A framework to evaluate the clinical utility of tumour markers was proposed by Hayes et al. in 1996. This tumour marker utility grading system was further refined in 2009 and will be used to grade the levels of evidence of the prognostic and predictive studies included in this review. The framework assigns a study type category based on five elements: 1) clinical trial design; 2) patients and patient data; 3) specimen collection, processing, and archival; 4) statistical design and analysis; and 5) study validation. A level of evidence (LoE) is then determined for the entire body of evidence based on the number of each study category type identified. (See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field.)</p>
<p>In brief, category A studies are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed with the tumour marker as the intervention, and only one RCT is required for LoE I. Level IB evidence is obtained with at least two category B study with consistent results. Category B studies are defined as RCTs that were designed to address a treatment intervention that is not the tumour marker and that prospectively enroll and follow patients, and prospectively collect tumour specimens, but the archived tumour tissue is used retrospectively to evaluate the tumour marker. Level II evidence is obtained when there is only one category B study, or multiple category B studies with inconsistent results, or when at least two category C studies with consistent results are identified. Category C studies are prospective observational registry studies that prospectively enroll patients in a registry and must prospectively collect, process, and archive tumour specimens, but treatment and follow-up are standard of care. Level III evidence is obtained when only one category C study is available, or if more than one is identified, but results are not consistent. Finally, level IV evidence is obtained when only retrospective observational studies are identified. Retrospective (category D) studies that assessed the prognostic or predictive abilities of the multigene profiling assays were excluded <em>a priori</em>; however, retrospective studies that evaluated a change in chemotherapy regimen based on the findings of a multigene profiling assay were included. In addition to quality assessment based on the tumour marker grading system, sources of bias, country in which the study was conducted, and sources of funding were extracted and considered to determine the overall quality of the studies.</p>

<p>At the request of Molecular Oncology Advisory Committee (MOAC), this recommendation report was developed by a Working Group consisting of a geneticist, two pathologists, three medical oncologists, the manager of pathology and laboratory medicine program at Cancer Care Ontario (CCO), and a health research methodologist.</p>
<p>The Working Group was responsible for reviewing the evidence base, drafting the recommendations, and responding to comments received during the document review process.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Report Development Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The Program in Evidence-Based Care (PEBC) produces evidence-based and evidence-informed guidance documents using the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. For Recommendation Reports, this process includes a systematic review, interpretation of the evidence and recommendation drafting by the Working Group, internal review by a methodology expert, and final approval by the Sponsoring Committee.</p>
<p>The PEBC uses the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II framework as a methodological strategy for guideline development. AGREE II is a 23-item validated tool that is designed to assess the methodological rigour and transparency of guideline development.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Given that there are now multiple multigene assays that can predict for recurrence in patients with invasive breast cancer, what is the level of evidence supporting the clinical validity and utility for each of these assays?</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Given that Oncotype DX is part of standard practice in Ontario, what is the evidence that other assays can complement or replace Oncotype DX for certain clinical utilities? </li>

<p>PEBC guideline development methods are described in more detail in the PEBC Handbook and the PEBC Methods Handbook (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p>The rating scheme for the strength of recommendations is specific to this particular guideline because the subject is one that has not been studied much methodologically (e.g., recommendations on molecular tests). The rule was that if there was level I evidence (according to the scheme laid out by Simon et al.) it was a moderate-strength recommendation, and otherwise it was weak. Given the nature of topic and the type of evidence involved, the authors believed that strong recommendations were for the most part impossible.</p></div>"/>
