	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Statement 1. Patient History and Physical Examination</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To promote a consistent and systematic approach to the initial evaluation of the patient with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate, as few if any studies specifically investigate the diagnostic yield or effect of history and examination on tinnitus patients </li>
    <li>Benefits: Identify organic, and potentially treatable, underlying causes (e.g., secondary tinnitus); minimize cost and administrative burden through a targeted approach to history and physical examination; streamline care/increase efficiency; improve patient satisfaction; identify patients with primary tinnitus who may benefit from further management (as outlined in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: None </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perception by the guideline development group (GDG) that tinnitus sufferers may not receive thorough evaluations from clinicians; further perception that many clinicians are unaware of the optimal targeted history and physical examination to evaluate a patient with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The definition of a &quot;targeted&quot; history and physical examination is elaborated upon in the supporting text. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 2a. Prompt Audiologic Examination</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain a comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, associated with hearing difficulties, or persistent (&amp;ge;6 months).</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over risk.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To address potential underutilization of audiologic testing in patients with tinnitus who are likely to have underlying hearing loss and to avoid delay in such diagnosis </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Moderate, as literature about the effect of prompt audiologic assessment on tinnitus management is scant </li>
    <li>Benefits: Prioritize the need for otolaryngologic evaluation (if not already completed) using audiologic criteria; identify hearing loss, which is frequently associated with tinnitus; characterize the nature of hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, or mixed; unilateral or bilateral); detect hearing loss that may be unsuspected; initiate workup for serious disease that causes unilateral tinnitus and hearing loss (i.e., vestibular schwannoma [VS]) </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Direct cost of examination; access to testing; time </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>prompt</em> is used to emphasize the importance of ordering a timely test and ensuring that it is done within 4 weeks of assessment, preferably. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Small; patients may participate in decisions regarding timing of audiogram </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 2b. Routine Audiologic Examination</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status).</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Option</span> based on observational studies, with a balance of benefit and harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunities: To promote awareness of hearing loss associated with tinnitus, even in patients who do not have unilateral tinnitus or hearing difficulties, and to emphasize that clinicians do not have to wait 6 months before obtaining an audiogram if deemed appropriate </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies and prevalence of hearing loss in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tinnitus therapy </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefits: Detect a hearing loss not perceived by the patient&amp;mdash;sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is a treatable condition commonly associated with tinnitus; identify patients who may be candidates for sound therapy; identify opportunities for patient counseling/education </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Direct costs of audiologic testing; detection of minor audiologic abnormalities leading to potentially unnecessary further testing or referral; inconsistent access to testing </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Large role for shared decision making to proceed with audiologic examination </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Option </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 3. Imaging Studies</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate the tinnitus, unless they have one or more of the following: tinnitus that localizes to 1 ear, pulsatile tinnitus, focal neurological abnormalities, or asymmetric hearing loss.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strong recommendation (against)</span> based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid overuse of imaging in patients with a low likelihood of any significant benefit from the imaging. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefits: Avoid testing with low yield; avoid harms of unnecessary tests (radiation, contrast, cost); avoid test anxiety; avoid detecting subclinical, incidental findings </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Slight chance of missed diagnosis; relatively high costs and limited access to certain types of imaging studies </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The GDG made this a strong recommendation against, instead of a recommendation against, based on consensus regarding the importance of avoiding low-yield, expensive tests with potential adverse events in patients with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Specific imaging studies are specified in the supporting text, including computerized tomography (CT), computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation (against) </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 4. Bothersome Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians must distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with non-bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strong recommendation</span> based on inclusion criteria for RCTs on tinnitus treatment, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To identify those patients in need of clinical management and limit unnecessary testing and treatment for others </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inclusion criteria for RCTs on tinnitus treatment </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefits: Identify patients for further counseling and/or intervention/management; determine effect of tinnitus on health-related quality of life (QOL); identify patients with bothersome tinnitus who may benefit from additional assessment for anxiety and depression; encourage an explicit and systematic assessment of patients to avoid underestimating or trivializing the effect of tinnitus; avoid unnecessary interventions/management of patients with non-bothersome tinnitus </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Time involved in assessment </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Method of distinguishing bothersome from non-bothersome is not specifically stated. One or more of the validated questionnaires described in the supporting text may be helpful. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 5. Persistent Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (&amp;ge;6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To identify patients with a duration of tinnitus similar to that studied in RCTs of tinnitus treatment; to identify those who may need and benefit from intervention; and to avoid inappropriate interventions for patients with shorter duration tinnitus </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inclusion criteria in RCTs </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Moderate, based on varying tinnitus duration in RCTs, with some including patients with tinnitus of less than 3 months' duration </li>
    <li>Benefits: Identify patients who have a duration of tinnitus similar to the patients included in RCTs, and identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from intervention </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Defer treatment that may benefit some tinnitus patients who do not have persistent symptoms </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Despite some variation in inclusion criteria for duration of tinnitus used in clinical trials, the GDG felt that 6 months was reasonable time to conclude that the tinnitus would likely persist. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 6. Education and Counseling</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on studies of the value of education and counseling, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To address potential underutilization of education and counseling by clinicians who manage patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. To bring awareness of available management strategies to the patient. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on studies of the value of education and counseling in general, and grade C based on such studies in tinnitus in particular </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefits: Improved QOL; increased ability to cope with tinnitus; improved outcomes and patient satisfaction; less health care utilization </li>

<p><strong>Statement 7. Hearing Aid Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients with hearing loss and persistent, bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunities: To promote awareness of the beneficial effect of hearing aids on tinnitus and encourage utilization of this first-line audiologic intervention for patients with tinnitus, even those who might otherwise be marginal hearing aid candidates </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefits: Raise awareness of potential beneficial effects of hearing aids on tinnitus; ensure that patient receives&amp;nbsp;proper guidance regarding benefits and costs of hearing aids; provide patients who have hearing loss with access to information and interventions that may alleviate hearing loss and improve function/QOL </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Direct cost related to dispensing of a hearing aid </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perceived lack of awareness regarding the ability of hearing aids to improve QOL for patients with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The level of hearing loss is not specified because hearing loss-associated tinnitus may benefit from hearing aids even if the hearing loss is only of a mild degree, or even if there is a more severe unilateral SNHL associated with the tinnitus. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Patient may accept or decline the recommendation to pursue a hearing aid evaluation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 8. Sound Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Option</span> based on RCTs with methodological concerns, with a balance between benefit and harm.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 10. Medical Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not routinely recommend antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for a primary indication of treating persistent, bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation (against)</span> based on systematic reviews and RCTs with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To decrease the use of medications that may have no benefit and have significant potential side effects, in the management of patients with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on RCTs with methodological concerns and systematic reviews demonstrating a low strength of evidence </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium regarding the lack of efficacy of medical therapy as a primary treatment for persistent bothersome tinnitus, as several studies with methodological flaws, bias, and lack of power did show some benefit in certain tinnitus outcome measures </li>
    <li>Benefits: Avoid unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), and false hope; reduce expense. Avoid use of medications that are not approved for use in geriatric population. </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Denying some patients benefit </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Although these therapies appear to be beneficial in some studies, the evidence from systematic reviews and RCTs is insufficient to justify routine use in managing tinnitus patients, especially given the known harms, cost of therapy, and potential for some medications (e.g., antidepressants) to worsen tinnitus. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>routine</em> is used to acknowledge that there may be individual circumstances for which clinicians and patients may wish to pursue therapy. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited; a trial of medication may be administered based on individual circumstances </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Patients with depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders that constitute an indication for pharmacologic therapy independent of tinnitus </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation (against) </li>
    <li>Differences in opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 11. Dietary Supplements</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not recommend Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation (against)</span> based on RCTs and systematic reviews with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To avoid use of commonly available supplements that have no proven efficacy and pose potential harm, in the management of patients with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, RCTs and systematic reviews with extreme heterogeneity; most of the RCTs raise significant concerns regarding methodology and subject selection </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High confidence regarding potential harm and adverse effects related to these agents, particularly in the elderly population; low confidence in benefits due to methodological concerns and study quality and ability to generalize results to patients with persistent, primary tinnitus </li>
    <li>Benefits: Avoid unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), and false hope; reduce expense </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: None </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: There is concern regarding the actual content and dosage of proposed active agents in these preparations, as they are currently packaged over the counter. Many of these supplements, not under the regulation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have varying amounts of the active agent. The GDG was concerned over the widespread availability for easy purchase of these agents without considering potential drug interactions and adverse events. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>dietary supplements</em> is used to generalize nutritional and herbal supplements promoted as remedies for tinnitus. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited role </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation (against) </li>
    <li>Differences in opinion: The majority of the GDG felt that there was a clear predominance of harm over benefit; a minority felt that there was equilibrium. None of the group perceived a preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 12. Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>No recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>No recommendation</span> based on poor quality trials, no benefit, and minimal harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Limited, to educate patients and providers about the controversies regarding the use of acupuncture for tinnitus </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on inconclusive RCTs and the presence of costs and potential harm with no established benefit with the use of acupuncture for tinnitus </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Low regarding benefit because of heterogeneity and methodological flaws in the RCTs; high regarding harm or cost, with the understanding that serious harm from acupuncture is rare. </li>
    <li>Benefits: No direct benefits of no recommendation </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Cost of acupuncture therapy, time required for therapy, and potential delay in instituting sound therapy or hearing aids </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Unknown </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The poor quality of the data and the limited potential for harm from acupuncture kept the GDG from making a recommendation about acupuncture. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Significant role for shared decision making; patients may wish to try acupuncture based on circumstances </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: No recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences in opinion: Minor: The GDG was divided between making no recommendation and making a recommendation against the use of acupuncture. </li>
</ul>

<p>Clinicians should not recommend TMS for the treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation (against)</span> based on inconclusive RCTs.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To avoid use of a therapy that has inconclusive efficacy and poses potential financial and physical harm, in the management of patients with tinnitus </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inconclusive RCTs and systematic reviews that show low strength of evidence </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High regarding the absence of a long-term (&amp;gt;6 months) benefit of TMS; moderate regarding the absence of a short term benefit, since a minority of trials demonstrated transient beneficial outcomes, and strength of this evidence is low </li>
    <li>Benefits: Avoid unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events, and false hope; reduce expense </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Denying some patients benefit </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited </li>

<p>The initial search yielded 271 potential guidelines and 621 potential systematic reviews or meta-analyses. After removing duplicates, articles not related to tinnitus, those not indicating or explicitly stating a systematic review methodology, and non-English language articles, 8 guidelines and 71 systematic reviews or meta-analyses remained. After review by authors and guideline development group (GDG) leadership, 29 systematic reviews were ultimately used in the final publication.</p>
<p>A second literature search identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to April 1, 2013. The following databases were used: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL. The search identified 2046 potential RCTs. After removing duplicates, non-English language articles, animal model studies, and nonrandomized trials, 232 RCTs remained.</p>
<p>Final results of both literature searches were distributed to panel members. This material was supplemented, as needed, with targeted searches to address specific needs identified in writing the guideline through August 2013.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline was developed using an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm, as outlined in the third edition of <em>Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual: A Quality-Driven Approach for Translating Evidence into Action</em>. Members of the&amp;nbsp;guideline development group (GDG), include pediatric and adult otolaryngologists, otologists/neurotologists, a geriatrician, a behavioral neuroscientist, a neurologist, an audiologist, a family physician, a radiologist, a psychiatrist, an internist, a psychoacoustician, an advanced nurse practitioner, a resident physician, and consumer advocates.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the clinical practice guideline (CPG)&amp;nbsp;development process, an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) comparative effectiveness review (CER) on the evaluation and treatment of tinnitus was published in August 2013. The evidence reviews in this document were studied by the GDG, analyzed, and integrated into the recommendations of this CPG where appropriate and relevant.</p>
<p>In a series of conference calls, the working group defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 12 months devoted to guideline development ending in November 2013, the group met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, using electronic decision support (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut, USA) software to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft were used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting CPGs.</p>
<p>American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in November 2013 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.</p>
<p>The recommendations contained in the guideline are based on the best available data published through April 2013. Where data were lacking, a combination of clinical experience and expert consensus was used.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. They must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline panel sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>
    <li>This clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing patients with tinnitus. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>

<p>This clinical practice guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery</em> to facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will be accessible, free of charge, at <a href=&quot;http://www.entnet.org&quot; title=&quot;American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery FoundationWeb site&quot;>http://www.entnet.org</a>. In addition, all American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guidelines are now available via the <em>Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery</em> app for smart phones and tablets. The guideline will be presented to AAO-HNSF members as a mini-seminar at the 2014 AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting &amp;amp; OTO EXPO. Existing website content, brochures, and publications by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations. Podcasts will be developed to introduce the recommendations of this guideline to target clinicians. A plain language summary will be developed to help lay persons navigate the recommendations of this guideline, with emphasis on avoiding unproven and potentially harmful tinnitus treatments. In addition, the AAO-HNSF has developed a flow chart for clinicians (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) to help clinicians understand the key decisions for evaluation and management of tinnitus as well as to demonstrate the appropriate target patients for the recommendations of this clinical practice guideline (CPG).</p>
<p>The guideline development group (GDG) agreed that the action statements likely to generate the most discussion among clinicians are those recommending against the use of conventional medical therapies and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (including dietary supplements). The group recognized the wide use of a variety of medications for tinnitus, as well as a number of available CAM treatments for tinnitus. The quality of available evidence did not support the use of such medications. Suggestions for future study of these agents for tinnitus, with strict methodology, are detailed in the next section.</p>
<p>The GDG also discussed the cost and availability of recommended interventions, such as hearing aid evaluation, sound therapy devices, and cognitive behavioral therapies. These treatments are often excluded from traditional medical insurance coverage, and specialists who can evaluate and recommend these treatments for tinnitus may not be available to the large number of persons with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.</p></div>"/>

<p>The cost of developing this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established &quot;stake&quot; in an issue.</p>
