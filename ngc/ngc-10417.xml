	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) has already developed guidelines addressing many of the components of secondary prevention (i.e., tobacco cessation, hypertension, lipid management, diabetes mellitus, obesity [physical activity, weight management, nutrition], and immunizations). The review began with the UMHS guidelines and the national guidelines referenced in them. The review expanded to other relevant guidelines of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the American Stroke Association (ASA). Then evidence from relevant guidelines referenced in those guidelines and other relevant national guidelines known to the authors were added. The search focused on guidelines published from January 2000 through July 2008 to produce the 2009 version of this guideline. This 2014 update included similar searches for evidence in more current guidelines over the period from August 2008 through December 2013. The section of this guideline on &quot;Related National Guidelines&quot; lists twenty current national guidelines on which this overview is based.</p>

    <li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert regarding serious neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in patients taking varenicline; however, it still continues to be considered first line therapy. Clinicians should elicit information on their patients' psychiatric history and monitor them for changes in mood or behavior on therapy. </li>
    <li>Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Prasugrel is not recommended in patients older than 75 years of age except in those patients with diabetes or prior history of myocardial infarction (MI). Prasugrel has not been studied in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). </li>
        <li>Ticagrelor is associated with higher rates of transient dyspnea and bradycardia. Ticagrelor has not been studied in elective PCI. </li>
        <li>The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel increases the risk of bleeding without reducing the risk of stroke, therefore, the long-term use of dual antiplatelet therapy cannot be recommended for non-cardioembolic stroke. </li>
        <li>Anticoagulation with warfarin or one of the three new anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding without reducing the risk of ischemic events in patients with stroke due to cardioemboli. </li>
        <li>Antiplatelet therapy reduces risk of cardiovascular events, but increases risk for gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding. </li>
        <li>There are limited data on the safety of &quot;triple therapy&quot; with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, leading to significant concerns about the risk of bleeding. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the acute setting, the routine use of intravenous (IV) &amp;beta; blockers for all patients is not recommended, as it may be harmful to administer them to those with contraindications to beta blockade, signs of heart failure or low output state, or other risk factors for cardiogenic shock. </li>
    <li>Serum potassium should be monitored closely during treatment with aldosterone blockade. Although uncommon, life-threatening hyperkalemia can occur due to the combination of aldosterone inhibition, reduced aldosterone secretion associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, and a progressive decline in renal perfusion due to heart failure. </li>
    <li>The selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and other nonselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The risk of cardiovascular events is proportional to COX-2 selectivity. </li>
    <li>Of note, some herbal remedies can have cardiotoxic properties, some may lower serum potassium, and some may interact with cardiovascular drugs. </li>
    <li>Patient selection for carotid revascularization is important as perioperative risks can negate potential benefits from the procedure. </li>
