	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>conditional</strong>) and the quality of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, <strong>very low</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Screening for Maternal Syphilis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) sexually transmitted infection (STI) guideline recommends screening all pregnant women for syphilis during the first antenatal care visit (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em>: This recommendation applies to all settings, including settings with high or low prevalence of syphilis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Screening Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Refer to section 5.3 of the main guideline text for the explanations and flowcharts for the various screening and treatment strategies mentioned (Strategies A-D).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></p>
<p>In settings with low coverage of syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women, high loss to follow-up of pregnant women, or limited laboratory capacity, the WHO STI guideline suggests on-site tests (Strategies A, B and C) rather than the standard off-site laboratory-based screening and treatment strategy (<strong>conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong></p>
<p>In settings with a low prevalence of syphilis (below 5%), the WHO STI guideline suggests a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) be used to screen pregnant women (Strategy A) rather than a single on-site rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (Strategy B) (<strong>conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong></p>
<p>In settings with a high prevalence of syphilis (5% or greater), the WHO STI guideline suggests an on-site RST and, if positive, provision of a first dose of treatment and an RPR test, and then, if the RPR test is positive, provision of treatment according to duration of syphilis (Strategy C). The WHO STI guideline suggests this sequence of tests and treatment rather than a single on-site RST (Strategy A) or a single on-site RPR test (Strategy B) (<strong>conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><em>Remarks</em>: These recommendations do not apply to countries that can provide appropriate/high-quality laboratory-based screening and treatment strategies. However, in some settings there may be challenges providing such strategies and/or a sequence of tests. When resources do not permit the use of a sequence of tests, a single on-site RST (Strategy A) is suggested to ensure greater screening coverage despite the number of pregnant women who will be over-treated due to the high rate of false-positive results. Treatment is based on duration of syphilis, according to the WHO guideline for the treatment of <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (syphilis) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Early Syphilis (Primary, Secondary and Early Latent Syphilis of Not More Than Two Years' Duration)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong></p>
<p>In pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over no treatment (<strong>strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong></p>
<p>In pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests using benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once daily for 10 days (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>When benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g., due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g., due to stock-outs), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 14 days or ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly once daily for 10 to 14 days or azithromycin 2g once orally.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em>: Although erythromycin and azithromycin treat the pregnant women, they do not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated. It is therefore necessary to treat the newborn infant soon after delivery (see recommendations 9 and 10 in the WHO guidelines for the treatment of syphilis, which refer to congenital syphilis). Ceftriaxone is an expensive option and is injectable. Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, <strong>stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Late Syphilis (Infection of More Than Two Years' Duration Without Evidence of Treponemal Infection)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong></p>
<p>In pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over no treatment (<strong>strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><em>Remarks</em>: The interval between consecutive doses of benzathine penicillin should not exceed 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong></p>
<p>In pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once a day for 20 days (<strong>conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p>When benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g., due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g., due to stock-outs), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 30 days.</p>
<p><em>Remarks</em>: Although erythromycin treats the pregnant women, it does not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated. It is therefore necessary to treat the newborn infant soon after delivery (see recommendations 9 and 10 in the WHO guidelines for the treatment of syphilis, which refer to congenital syphilis). Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, <strong>stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: The guideline development group is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. </p>

<p>The systematic reviews for each priority question were conducted by McMaster University, the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy. Evidence for desirable and undesirable outcomes, patient values and preferences, resources, acceptability, equity and feasibility were reviewed from published and unpublished literature. Comprehensive searches for previously conducted systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies were performed up to October 2016. Additional searches were conducted to identify studies on patient values and preferences (e.g., qualitative research designs) and resources (e.g., cost-effectiveness studies) (see Annex B in the original guideline document for information on these searches).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search for Evidence for Effects of Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p>To avoid duplication of reviews that have been previously published, evidence was searched using a hierarchical approach. The team first searched for synthesized evidence then searched the primary studies for all the factors needed to complete the evidence-to-decision framework for each question (i.e., benefits and harms, patient values, acceptability, feasibility, equity and costs). </p>
<p>The hierarchical approach consisted of identifying pre-existing synthesized evidence, including from previously published guidelines that included systematic reviews of the literature. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) updated the searches of relevant systematic reviews to determine if more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies were available. </p>
<p>The search strategies were developed by an information specialist trained in systematic reviews. The strategies included the use of keywords from the controlled vocabulary of the database and text words based on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions. There were no restrictions based on language, publication status or study design (with the exception of searches for systematic reviews). The Cochrane Library suite of databases (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR], Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE], Health Technology Assessment [HTA] database and the American College of Physicians [ACP] Journal Club) was searched for published systematic reviews and protocols up to October 2016. </p>
<p>Relevant systematic reviews (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) were updated by searching for additional primary studies (i.e., published since the latest publication date included in the previous search) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (up to October 2016). The strategies included searching for subject headings and text words related to syphilis and specific interventions and tests. Additional strategies included checking reference lists and consulting with the GDG for any missed articles.</p>
<p>See Annex B in the original guideline document for the search strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Studies</strong></p>
<p>Two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts of systematic reviews identified through database searching to determine studies eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Disagreements were resolved by discussing study inclusion with a third member of the research team.</p>

<p>The quality/certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Evidence came primarily from modelling of the patient-important outcomes which were based on appropriate inputs such as screening rates, diagnostic test accuracy and the effects of treatments. Therefore, the overall certainty of the evidence was based on the inputs and linking of these data in the model. The quality/certainty of the evidence was assessed at four levels (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Data were extracted from the systematic reviews and studies. When data could not be pooled across studies, narrative synthesis methods were used. Results were presented in tables or were narratively described by direction of the effect or by statistical significance as reported in the primary study. </p>
<p>Since there was little data directly comparing screening to no screening or comparing different test strategies to each other or comparing the effect on patient important outcomes, cost-effectiveness modelling studies were used to provide evidence. For the question comparing screening to no screening, data from a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis were used. The number of infant outcomes was extracted from the model and then presented. For the question comparing different test strategies, the evidence was modelled from test accuracy data and from the calculated effects on patient important outcomes. A published cost-effectiveness analysis used: field data for the screening and treatment rates of syphilis in countries with low and high prevalence of syphilis; the sensitivity and specificity of single rapid syphilis tests (RSTs) in the field and from published research; and the effects of treatments. The data used in the analysis were confirmed using another unpublished systematic review of test accuracy data of single RSTs. The outputs of the cost-effectiveness analysis were extracted from the model and presented by test strategy and by outcomes for screening rate, treatment rate, missed cases, over-treatment, and cases treated (see Web annex D [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evidence-to-Decision Frameworks</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence-to-decision frameworks were developed using GRADEpro software (<a href=&quot;https://www.gradepro.org&quot; title=&quot;GRADEpro Web site&quot;>www.gradepro.org</a>). Evidence-to-decision frameworks present the desirable and undesirable effects of the interventions, the value of the outcomes, the costs and resource use, the acceptability of the interventions to all stakeholders, the impact on health equity, and the feasibility of implementation (i.e., the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] criteria for making decisions). The evidence-to-decision frameworks are based on a population perspective for these recommendations. All GRADE criteria were considered from this perspective. The evidence-to-decision frameworks for each recommendation are available in Web annex D.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Group (GDG)</span></strong></p>
<p>To update the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the prevention, treatment and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a GDG was established, comprising 33 international STI experts, including clinicians, researchers and programme managers. A core subgroup to focus on the guidelines related to syphilis was created within the GDG, to provide more intensive feedback throughout the process. The GDG participated in meetings and teleconferences to prioritize the questions to be addressed, discuss the evidence reviews and finalize the recommendations. Additional sub-working group teleconferences were organized to review the methodology and results of systematic reviews and to discuss and finalize the evidence reviews and recommendations. The GDG reviewed and approved the final version of the guidelines. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Questions and Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>To determine which recommendations to update, in December 2013 the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research reviewed current recommendations of key international guidelines. See Annex B in the original guideline document for a list of the guidelines.</p>
<p>In December 2013, the first GDG meeting was held to identify and agree on the key PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions that formed the basis for the systematic reviews and the recommendations. Following this meeting, a survey of GDG members was conducted to prioritize the questions and outcomes according to clinical relevance and importance. PICO questions were identified for syphilis screening for pregnant women including questions relating to the options of no screening, mass treatment and test strategies using different tests. Only outcomes that were ranked as critical or important to patients and decision-making were included (see the &quot;Major Outcomes Considered&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Making the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence was presented and discussed during a second meeting of the GDG in October 2015, which was facilitated by two co-chairs &amp;ndash; one with expertise in GRADE and the other with clinical STI expertise. After discussion, it was decided that additional information should be obtained. Therefore, the screening recommendations were formulated during subsequent teleconference calls and electronic communications with the GDG working group for syphilis. To formulate the recommendations, the GDG working group for syphilis considered and discussed the desirable and undesirable effects of the interventions, the value placed on the outcomes, the associated costs and use of resources, the acceptability of the interventions to all stakeholders (including people affected by STIs), the impact on health equity and the feasibility of implementation. </p>
<p>The GDG working group for syphilis made judgements for each of the above criteria and an overall judgement about each recommendation and the strength of each recommendation was made. If there had been disagreements about the judgements, the planned procedure was for the GDG to take a vote and record the results. However, no votes were taken because the GDG reached consensus during discussion for all of the judgements and recommendations. Following the discussions of the GDG working group for syphilis, the recommendations were finalized via teleconference and final approval was obtained from all GDG members electronically. This guideline was subsequently written up in full and then peer reviewed. </p>

    <li>Non-treponemal tests are not highly specific for syphilis and can give false-positive results in conditions such as acute febrile viral infections and some chronic autoimmune diseases. Most false-positive results have low titres of less than 1 : 4. Non-treponemal tests may be negative for up to four weeks after the lesion of primary syphilis first appears and can be negative in late latent syphilis; additionally in primary and secondary syphilis, these tests may be false negative due to a prozone reaction (i.e., interference by high concentrations of antibodies in a specimen, which can be uncovered by dilution and retesting). </li>

<p><strong>Adaptation, Implementation and Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines provide recommendations for syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women, based on the best global evidence available at the time of compilation. However, the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) vary by geographical location and are constantly changing, sometimes rapidly. It is recommended that countries conduct good-quality studies to gather the information needed to adapt these guidelines to the local STI situation as they update their national guidelines. In areas lacking local data as a basis for adaptation, the recommendations in this guideline can be adopted as presented here. </p>
<p>For further guidance on adaptation, implementation and monitoring of national guidelines, please refer to <em><a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/69878/1/WHO_RHR_07.9_eng.pdf&quot; title=&quot;WHO Web site&quot;>Introducing the World Health Organization's (WHO's) sexual and reproductive health guidelines and tools into national programmes: principles and processes of adaptation and implementation</a></em>.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 3 in the original guideline document for information on dissemination and updating of the guideline. Refer to Section 5.2 for information on consideration on the implementation of antenatal syphilis screening and treatment.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Management of conflicts of interest was a key priority throughout the process of guideline development. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for declaration of interests (DOI) for WHO experts were implemented. DOI statements were obtained from all GDG members prior to assuming their roles in the group. At the GDG meetings (December 2013 and October 2015), the members disclosed their interests, if any, at the beginning of the meetings. The DOI statements are summarized in Web annex E (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). </p>
<p>After analysing each DOI, the WHO STI Secretariat concluded that no member had financial or commercial interests related to sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment. Other notified interests were minor; they were either not related to STI or were non-commercial grants or interests. The STI team concluded that there were no significant conflicts of interest that would exclude any member from participating fully in the guideline development process. Therefore, options for conditional participation, partial or total exclusion of any GDG member were not discussed.</p></div>"/>
