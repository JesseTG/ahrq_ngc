	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification of Hyperglycaemia First Detected during Pregnancy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<p>Hyperglycaemia first detected at any time during pregnancy should be classified as either:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy </li>
    <li>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy should be diagnosed by the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diabetes if 1 or more of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Fasting plasma glucose &amp;ge;7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) </li>
    <li>2-hour plasma glucose &amp;ge;11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) following a 75 g oral glucose load </li>
    <li>Random plasma glucose &amp;ge;1.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) in the presence of diabetes symptoms </li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>Quality of evidence: not graded; Strength of recommendation: not evaluated</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong></p>
<p>The diagnosis of GDM at any time during pregnancy should be based on any 1 of the following values:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Fasting plasma glucose = 5.1&amp;ndash;6.9 mmol/l (92&amp;ndash;125 mg/dl) </li>
    <li>1-hour post 75 g oral glucose load &amp;ge;10.0 mmol/l (180 mg/dl)* </li>
    <li>2-hour post 75 g oral glucose load 8.5&amp;ndash;11.0 mmol/l (153&amp;ndash;199 mg/dl) </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*There are no established criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes based on the 1-hour post-load value.</p>
<p>(<strong>Quality of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Low:</strong> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Very Low</strong>: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of recommendations is stated only for recommendations arrived at by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>: Moderate or high quality evidence of effectiveness for at least one critical outcome, desirable effects judged to outbalance the undesirable, or very low quality evidence on undesirable effects; can be adopted in most settings.</p>
<p><strong>Weak/conditional</strong>: Low or very low quality evidence of effectiveness for all critical outcomes, small benefits, or harms judged to dominate over benefits; questionable feasibility in low-resource settings.</p></div>"/>

No systematic reviews were identified and a systematic review was commissioned from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre and Universidade Federal de S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full article).</p>
<p>For the effect of treating hyperglycaemia in pregnancy compared with usual antenatal care the following databases were searched up to February 2012: African Index Medicus; CENTRAL; ClinicalTrials.gov register; WHO.int trial search; EMBASE; IMEMR; IMSEAR; Indian Medical Journals (IndMED); ISI Web of Knowledge; KoreaMed; LILACS; Panteleimon; PubMed; WPRIM without language, country or time of publication restrictions. Two recent systematic reviews were identified. However, to gain a more global and broader perspective, and to be able to include the critical outcome of perinatal mortality, not directly addressed in these systematic reviews, a new systematic review, which also included older trials using quasi-randomization, was commissioned from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and the Universidade Federal de S&amp;atilde;o Paulo (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full article). The same institution performed a modelling study based on data derived from these two systematic reviews to compare the impact of applying the 1999 WHO criteria and the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria in a universal screening programme.</p>
<p>The researchers of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) Study provided results of additional analyses of the dataset as requested by the guideline development group.</p>
<p><strong>Gestational Diabetes and Pregnancy Outcomes - a Systematic Review of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) Diagnostic Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Types of Study</span></p>
<p>Cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) were considered for inclusion in this systematic review if they provided sufficient information to estimate the associations of the WHO and/or the IADPSG criteria with related perinatal and maternal outcomes. To avoid selection bias, reviewers included only studies that applied the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) universally to all participants. They therefore excluded studies applying the OGTT only in women with certain clinical risk factors (such as family history, obesity, previous gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM]) or in those positive in pre-OGTT glucose screening (with, for example, a 50 g challenge test and/or a fasting glucose). Also excluded were studies that did not distinguish pre-gestational diabetes mellitus from GDM, those not allowing the distinction between treated and untreated groups, and those not reporting outcomes for women classified as having a normal OGTT.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Types of Participants</span></p>
<p>The reviewers accepted studies which included women of any race, parity, age, body weight or other socio-demographic characteristics.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Types of Diagnostic Tests</span></p>
<p>Only studies based on a 2-hour 75-g OGTT performed during the second or the third trimesters were included, and only if they provided results for a diagnosis based on at least the 2-hour post-load glucose. Studies based on capillary glucose measurements were included.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Types of Outcome Measures</span></p>
<p>The reviewers decided to analyze, as perinatal outcomes, large for gestational age births and macrosomia (as defined by the authors), as well as perinatal mortality (fetal death and early neonatal death). Regarding maternal outcomes, they chose to analyze cesarean delivery and preeclampsia according to individual study definitions.</p>
<p><em>Search Methods for the Identification of Studies</em></p>
<p>The search strategy used the following general terms, adapted to each database: &quot;gestational diabetes&quot; or &quot;glucose intolerance&quot; and the appropriate terms for each of the maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes specified above. Specific terms used for the electronic search are detailed in the &quot;Additional file 1: Description of the electronic search strategy used to perform the literature search&quot; (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Ten electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Library [CENTRAL], CINHAL, WHO-Afro library, IMSEAR, EMCAT, IMEMR and WPRIM) were searched for articles published from inception up to March 15, 2011. No language or country restrictions were applied. The reviewers also searched for additional studies from classical review articles. The reference lists of all articles selected for full text reading were reviewed for additional potentially eligible studies.</p>
<p><em>Selection of Studies</em></p>
<p>All citations identified were entered into an electronic database and duplicates were deleted. Initially, two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts of potentially relevant studies for eligibility. When the information was not sufficient to determine if the article was eligible for inclusion, the article's full text was obtained for further evaluation. Discrepancies were discussed until consensus was reached.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness of Gestational Diabetes Treatment: a Systematic Review with Quality of Evidence Assessment</strong></p>
<p><em>Eligibility Criteria</em></p>
<p>The reviewers included controlled clinical trials comparing GDM treatment to usual antenatal care for pregnant women with a diagnosis of GDM according to the individual study definitions. No restrictions were made regarding language, or publication date or status.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,&amp;nbsp;they included studies with random allocation or systematic quasi-random allocation, such as alternation.&amp;nbsp;They excluded experimental studies using non-systematic treatment allocation methods such as clinician judgment, subject preference or availability of the intervention.</p>
<p><em>Outcomes of Interest</em></p>
<p>Outcomes were extracted according to the study author's definitions, which varied for most outcomes. Perinatal outcomes were perinatal mortality, macrosomia, large for gestational age and small for gestational age birth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, congenital abnormalities, preterm birth, birth trauma (defined as bone fracture or brachial plexus palsy), shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia and respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
<p>Maternal outcomes were maternal mortality, preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, caesarean section and diabetes later in life.</p>
<p><em>Literature Search and Study Selection</em></p>
<p>The search strategy used the following general terms, adapted to each database: &quot;gestational diabetes&quot;, &quot;random*&quot;, &quot;controlled clinical trial&quot;, &quot;diabet*&quot; and &quot;pregnan*&quot;. Terms used for the electronic search are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. The reviewers searched 14 electronic databases (African index medicus; CENTRAL; <a href=&quot;http://ClinicalTrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;ClinicalTrials.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://ClinicalTrials.gov</a> register; EMBASE; IMEMR; IMSEAR; IndMED; ISI Web of Knowledge; KoreaMed; LILACS; Panteleimon; PubMed; <a href=&quot;http://WHO.int&quot; title=&quot;WHO Web site&quot;>http://WHO.int</a> trial search; and WPRIM) for articles published from inception up to February 2012.</p>
<p>They also searched for additional studies by reviewing the reference lists of review articles and of controlled clinical trials, including the list of excluded studies from other systematic reviews.</p>
<p>All citations identified were entered into an electronic database, and duplicates were deleted. Initially, two investigators independently screened potentially relevant studies through the titles and abstracts. When the information was not sufficient to determine if the article was eligible for inclusion, a full text was obtained for further evaluation. Discrepancies were discussed until consensus was reached.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse</strong>: This guideline is based on two systematic reviews commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Gestational Diabetes and Pregnancy Outcomes - a Systematic Review of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) Diagnostic Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction and Management</strong></p>
<p>Two independent investigators reviewed the eligible studies and extracted data using a standardized form prepared for this review. Disagreements were discussed and resolved in a consensus meeting. When raw quantitative data were not reported, approximate values were obtained from the figures or calculated from percentages.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Methodological Quality</strong></p>
<p>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by examining factors which might affect the strength of the association between glucose levels and outcomes. In particular, the following factors were assessed in each study: i) adequate selection of participants: consecutive recruitment from prenatal clinics; ii) adequate standardization of the glucose tolerance test (pre-analytic factors such as anhydrous glucose, plasma immediately separated or kept with glycolytic inhibitors and kept refrigerated until centrifugation; and analytic factors such as enzymatic method of measurement and laboratory quality control); iii) adequate report of losses to follow up and; iv) medical staff blinded to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Data for the WHO and the IADPSG criteria were aggregated and presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Meta-analysis data were combined using random-effect models, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. The statistical analysis was performed using the R version 2.11.1 software, package metafor version 1.6-0. As the aim was to investigate diagnostic criteria based on their capacity to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)-related outcomes for classification purposes rather than for etiological investigation, all statistical analyses were crude, without adjustment for potential confounders.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Heterogeneity</strong></p>
<p>Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane's chi<sup>2</sup> statistics with a significance level of 0.10. Inconsistency indexes (I<sup>2</sup>) were also calculated, and a value greater than 50% was considered an indicator of high inconsistency between studies.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity Analysis and Assessment of Publication Bias</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers did sensitivity analyses in order to examine the influence of the HAPO study and Brazilian Study of Gestational Diabetes (EBDG) on the magnitude and consistency of associations with outcomes. In addition to REML, reviewers also aggregated data with other variance estimators (Maximum Likelihood, Empirical Bayes, Sidik-Jonkman and DerSimonian and Laird) and with a fixed effect model in order to assess the robustness of the model.</p>
<p>Publication bias was tested using a funnel plot and Egger's test based on weighted regression. The full database for the EBDG study was available which allowed analysis for both criteria for all outcomes. The EBDG study was approved by local institutional review boards and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data from the other studies were obtained from published articles cited in the list of references.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Effectiveness of Gestational Diabetes Treatment: a Systematic Review with Quality of Evidence Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Management</strong></p>
<p>Two independent investigators reviewed the eligible studies and extracted data using a standardized form. Information extracted from each individual trial consisted of: (1) characteristics of trial participants (population source, age, ethnicity and pre-gravid body mass index [BMI]); (2) diagnostic procedures (type of test used, gestational age at testing, GDM diagnostic criteria and results for oral glucose tolerance and glucose challenge tests); (3) type of intervention (treatment performed and number of women requiring use of anti-diabetics); (4) outcome measures and their definition according to individual studies; and (5) methodological quality of data, as explained below.</p>
<p>Disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached. When quantitative data were not reported, approximate values were obtained from the figures or calculated from proportions.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Data were combined using random-effect meta-analysis models, with REML variance estimator and presented as RR with 95% CI. Most statistical analyses were performed using the R version 2.11.1 software, package metafor version 1.6-0. For trial sequential analysis, TSA software was used. To evaluate the impact of treatment, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT).</p>
<p>The reviewers assessed heterogeneity using a standard &amp;chi;<sup>2</sup> test with a significance level of 0.10. In view of the low power of such tests, they also examined heterogeneity with the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, where I<sup>2</sup> greater than 50% was considered an indicator of high inconsistency across studies. Since they included trials with quasi-random allocation methods, sensitivity analysis was performed stratifying studies according to allocation concealment quality for all available outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition to REML, they also aggregated data with other variance estimators (maximum likelihood, empirical Bayes, Sidik&amp;ndash;Jonkman, and DerSimonian and Laird) and with a fixed effect model, in order to assess model robustness. Trial sequential analysis was performed for macrosomia, large for gestational age birth, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and caesarean section in order to determine the sufficiency of the available data. The observed rates in the control groups were used to estimate the incidence of outcomes, as well as their consistency across studies. In these analyses, statistical power was defined as 80% for an alpha of 5%, assuming relative risk reduction (RRR) of 35% for macrosomia, 35% for large for gestational age birth, 25% for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, and 20% for caesarean section.</p>
<p>Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test based on weighted regression for outcomes with at least five studies. Adjustment for publication bias with the trim and fill method was performed as needed.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="145" ordby="545" id="414" name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Formulation of Recommendations and Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations were formulated by the co-chairs and discussed at two group meetings and by e-mail communication. The diagnostic cut-off plasma glucose values for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence tables. The GRADE process was not used for the recommendations on classification of hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy due to limitations of GRADE for this purpose, nor for diagnostic criteria for diabetes first diagnosed in pregnancy, due to lack of data on the relationship between glycaemia and specific chronic diabetic complications throughout the glycaemic range in untreated pregnant women. Consensus was a priori defined as agreement of a large majority of guideline group members, without strong disagreements. If the group members were unable to reach consensus, the recommendation would be put to a vote and would stand if voted for by a simple majority and the dissenting views presented in the report. However, the group reached consensus on every recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Benefits, Values and Preferences</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) considered potential benefits (to mother and child) of adopting the new criteria in the prevention of short-term pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Potential long-term benefits to the health of the mother and her offspring were not considered given the paucity of the data available.</p>
<p>The GDG did not evaluate potential risks of treating GDM, with the exception of delivering low birth weight and premature delivery. There are no data on the consequences of false positive or false negative test results, nor on whether or not the (arguably minor) inconveniences/harms of an oral glucose load and blood sampling outweigh the benefits of diagnostic testing.</p>
<p>Potential negative effects of adopting the new diagnostic criteria on the personal satisfaction, quality of life or psychological aspects of individual patients were not evaluated as data on this still have to emerge following eventual implementation of the new criteria. The cost-effectiveness of using these diagnostic criteria will depend on underlying population glucose intolerance and whether the test will be used for diagnostic testing only, or for screening of various scope (testing all pregnant women, testing &quot;at high risk&quot; women only). The cost-effectiveness data are yet to emerge.</p>
<p>The GDG estimated the impact of adopting the new criteria on the incidence of adverse outcomes of GDM and on the number needed to screen to prevent one potential adverse outcome.</p>
<p>The values and preferences accounted for in the decision making process were those of the GDG given that several of its members are women and the impracticality of including pregnant women in the lengthy guideline development process. Data on the preference of pregnant women for a particular diagnostic test are unavailable. Based on their clinical experience, the GDG considered that pregnant women were more concerned about the outcome of their pregnancy than by the relatively minor inconveniences of diagnostic testing labelling and possible treatment of limited duration.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Testing early in the first trimester using a fasting plasma glucose cut-point of 5.1 mmol/l (92 mg/dl) might overdiagnose gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in non-obese women who have values close to the cut-point. On the other hand, higher first trimester fasting plasma glucose levels (but lower than those diagnostic of diabetes) are associated with increased risks of later diagnosis of GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

    <li>These new criteria are expected to increase the number of women identified with GDM and consequently increase the burden on the health system.

Measurement of plasma glucose values can be used for screening as well as diagnosis of any hyperglycaemic state.
