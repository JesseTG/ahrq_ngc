	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Very Low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis and Classification</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Diabetic foot infection must be diagnosed clinically, based on the presence of local and systemic signs and symptoms of inflammation (<strong>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence: Moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>Assess the severity of any diabetic foot infection (DFI) using the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/IWGDF classification scheme (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Osteomyelitis<span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;></span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>For an infected open wound, perform a probe-to-bone test; in a patient at low risk for osteomyelitis, a negative test largely rules out the diagnosis, while in a high-risk patient, a positive test is largely diagnostic (<strong>Strong; High</strong>). </li>
    <li>Markedly elevated serum inflammatory markers, especially erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are suggestive of osteomyelitis in suspected cases (<strong>Weak; Moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>A definite diagnosis of bone infection usually requires positive results on both histological (and optimally microbiological) examinations of an aseptically obtained bone sample, but this is usually required only when the diagnosis is in doubt or determining the causative pathogen's antibiotic susceptibility is crucial (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>A probable diagnosing of bone infection is reasonable if there are positive results on a combination of diagnostic tests, such as probe-to-bone, serum inflammatory markers, plain X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or radionuclide scanning (<strong>Strong; Weak</strong>). </li>
    <li>Avoid using results of soft tissue or sinus tract specimens for selecting antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis as they do not accurately reflect bone culture results (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>Obtain plain X-rays of the foot in all cases of non-superficial DFI (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Use MRI when an advanced imaging test is needed for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>When MRI is not available or contraindicated, consider a white blood cell-labelled radionuclide scan, or possibly single-photon emission computed tomography (CT) and computed tomography (SPECT/CT) or fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans (<strong>Weak; Moderate</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Assessing Severity</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;11&quot;>
    <li>At initial evaluation of any infected foot, obtain vital signs and appropriate blood tests, debride the wound and probe and assess the depth and extent of the infection to establish its severity (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
    <li>At initial evaluation, assess arterial perfusion and decide whether and when further vascular assessment or revascularization is needed (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Microbiological Considerations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;13&quot;>
    <li>Obtain cultures, preferably of a tissue specimen rather than a swab, of infected wounds to determine the identity of causative microorganisms and their antibiotic sensitivity (<strong>Strong; High</strong>). </li>
    <li>Do not obtain repeat cultures unless the patient is not clinically responding to treatment, or occasionally for infection control surveillance of resistant pathogens (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Send collected specimens to the microbiology laboratory promptly, in sterile transport containers, accompanied by clinical information on the type of specimen and location of the wound (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Surgical</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;16&quot;>
    <li>Consult a surgical specialist in selected cases of DFIs that are moderate and in all cases that are severe (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Performing urgent surgical intervention is necessary in most cases of deep abscesses, compartment syndrome and virtually all necrotizing soft tissue infections (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Considering surgical intervention is usually advisable in cases of osteomyelitis accompanied by spreading soft tissue infection, destroyed soft tissue envelope, progressive bone destruction on X-ray or bone protruding through the ulcer (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Antimicrobial Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;19&quot;>
    <li>While virtually all clinically infected diabetic foot wounds require antimicrobial therapy, do not treat clinically uninfected diabetic foot wounds with antimicrobial therapy (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Select specific antibiotic agents for treatment based on the likely or proven causative pathogens, their antibiotic susceptibilities, the clinical severity of the infection, evidence of efficacy for DFI and costs (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>A course of antibiotic therapy of 1 to 2 weeks is usually adequate for most soft tissue DFIs (<strong>Strong; High</strong>). </li>
    <li>Administer parenteral therapy initially for most severe infections and some moderate infections, with a switch to oral therapy when the infection is responding (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wound Care</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;23&quot;>
    <li>Do not select a specific type of dressing for a DFI with the aim of preventing an infection, or improving its outcome (<strong>Strong; High</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treating Osteomyelitis</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;24&quot;>
    <li>For DFO, the IWDGF Working Group recommends 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy for patients who do not undergo resection of infected bone and no more than a week of antibiotic therapy if all infected bone is resected (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adjunctive Therapies</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;25&quot;>
    <li>The IWGDF Working Group suggests not using any adjunctive treatments for DFI (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues of Particular Importance in Developing (Low-Income) Countries</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;26&quot;>
    <li>When treating a DFI, assess for use of traditional remedies and previous antibiotic use and consider local bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility profile (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations in this guidance were formulated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence when writing a clinical guideline. The authors assessed the quality of evidence on the risk of bias of included studies, effect sizes, and expert opinion, and rated the quality of evidence as 'high,' 'moderate' or 'low.' They assessed the strength of each recommendation as 'strong' or 'weak,' based on the quality of evidence, balance between benefits and harm, patient values and preferences, and costs (resource utilization). The rationale behind each recommendation is described in the original guideline document. See the <a href=&quot;http://gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Web site&quot;>GRADE Web site</a> for more information.</p></div>"/>

The PubMed and Excerpta Medica (EMBASE) databases were searched using the string described in Online Appendix A that was designed to identify all prospective and retrospective studies, in any language, that evaluated interventions for the treatment of foot infections in people aged 18 years or older who had diabetes mellitus, and which were published before 30 June 2014. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case&amp;ndash;control studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, interrupted time series (ITS) or controlled before-and-after (CBA) design studies. Studies in which subjects with diabetic foot infections (DFIs) formed part of the total population were only included if the data for the subgroup with diabetes were separately described. Case series, uncontrolled case series and studies with non-concurrent controls were excluded, as were studies that were not related to treatment of DFIs.</p>
<p>One author assessed each study identified by the search string, based on the title and abstract, to see if it met the eligibility criteria. For potentially eligible publications, pairs of authors independently reviewed the full, published article to assess whether or not it met the eligibility criteria.

Quality items were rated as 'done', 'not done' or 'not reported', with only those rated as 'done' contributed to the methodological quality score. When scoring the study design, authors applied equal weighting to each validity criterion.</p>
<p>The methodological quality score was translated into a level of evidence using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network instrument as either level 1 (randomized controlled trials) or level 2 (case-control, cohort, controlled before-and-after [CBA] or interrupted time series [ITS] studies). Studies were also rated as follows: ++ (high quality with low risk of bias); + (well conducted with low risk of bias); or &amp;minus; (low quality with higher risk of bias). Co-reviewers worked to reach agreement on the findings from the data extraction and the evaluation of methodological quality of each article and described each study on a narrative basis. Because of the heterogeneity of study designs, interventions, follow-up and outcomes, we made no attempt to pool the results of the included studies.

In the second study, a subgroup analysis of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT), the authors performed a cost-minimization assessment comparing treatment with ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam. Because piperacillin/tazobactam requires more frequent dosing for drug preparation and administration, were higher.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In recent decades, as the prevalence of diabetes has increased, so too have foot complications, including infections. The development of a foot infection is associated with substantial morbidity, including discomfort, reduced physical and mental quality of life, need for healthcare provider visits, wound care, antimicrobial therapy and often surgical procedures. Furthermore, foot infection remains the most frequent diabetic complication requiring hospitalization and the most common precipitating event leading to lower extremity amputation. Managing infection requires careful attention to properly diagnosing the condition, obtaining appropriate specimens for culture, thoughtfully selecting empirical and then definitive antimicrobial therapy, quickly determining when surgical interventions are needed and providing all other necessary types of wound care. For these reasons, interdisciplinary teams should, whenever possible, include an infectious diseases or clinical microbiology specialist. A systematic and, to the extent possible, evidence-based approach to diabetic foot infections (DFIs) should result in better outcomes.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Failure to treat an infected diabetic foot wound with antimicrobial therapy is usually associated with progressive tissue destruction and poor wound healing. However, antibiotic therapy is associated with frequent adverse effects, financial costs and increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance, so it should be reserved for treating wounds that are infected. </li>
    <li>Fluoroquinolones are associated with an increased risk of adverse effects, including <em>Clostridium difficile </em>disease, and failure with one of these agents may cause resistance to others. </li>
    <li>One new agent, tigecycline (which has broad-spectrum activity, including against methicillin-resistant<em> Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA]), when compared with ertapenem (with or without vancomycin) was found in a recent large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to be significantly inferior in clinical outcomes and to have a significantly higher rate of adverse effects. </li>
    <li>Complications of percutaneous bone biopsy, such as minimal bleeding (&amp;le;3%), introducing bacteria into bone or inducing a fracture or acute Charcot arthropathy, are extremely rare. </li>
    <li>Both histology and culture results of bone specimens may be misleading. False-positive results caused by skin contamination can be reduced by using a dorsal route in case of a plantar ulcer and by keeping a minimal distance of 20 mm from the ulcer periphery when introducing the biopsy needle. Culture of a bone specimen may be falsely negative because of sampling errors, prior antibiotic therapy or a failure to isolate fastidious organisms. Similarly, bone histopathology may be falsely negative because of sampling error or falsely positive in patients with some non-infectious inflammatory disorders. </li>
