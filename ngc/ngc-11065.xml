	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

        <li>Perform a risk assessment upon the patient's entry to a healthcare setting, and repeat the assessment on a regularly scheduled basis, or when there is a significant change in the individual's condition. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Use a valid/reliable risk assessment tool in conjunction with the identification of additional risk factors (e.g., perfusion and oxygenation, increased body temperature, advanced age, etc.), along with clinical judgment. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Assess for intrinsic/extrinsic risk factors. Risk factors can be defined as anything that increases the chance of developing a pressure ulcer. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Identify high-risk settings and groups to identify where to target prevention efforts to minimize risk. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Assess and inspect skin regularly. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Monitor patients who have some degree of immobility frequently to minimize the risk of pressure ulcer formation. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Differentiate pressure ulcers from other types of wounds and moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) caused by incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) due to exposure to urine and/or stool, or intertriginous dermatitis (ITD) due to trapped perspiration. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Assess for incontinence and, based on assessment findings, implement an individualized plan for management of incontinence. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>

        <li>Utilize laboratory parameters as only one part of the nutritional assessment process, because they should not be considered in isolation. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Assess for history of a prior ulcer and/or presence of a current ulcer, previous treatments, and/or surgical interventions. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Assess pressure ulcer(s) on admission to a care setting, and regularly reassess and monitor for any signs of skin or wound deterioration. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;17&quot;>
        <li>Implement measures to reduce the risk of developing pressure ulcers: minimize/eliminate pressure, friction, and shear. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Minimize/eliminate pressure from medical devices such as oxygen tubing, catheters, cervical collars, casts, and restraints. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Maintain the head-of-bed elevation at/or below 30&amp;deg;, or at the lowest degree of elevation consistent with the patient's medical condition to prevent shear-related injury, and use a 30&amp;deg; side-lying position. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Schedule regular repositioning and turning for bedbound and chairbound individuals, taking into consideration the condition of the patient and the pressure redistribution support surface in determining the repositioning strategy. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Position sitting patients with special attention to the individual's anatomy, postural alignment, distribution of weight, and support of the feet. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider prophylactic dressings to prevent sacral and heel ulcers in at-risk patients. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = A (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Use heel suspension devices for patients who are at risk for pressure ulcers that elevate (float) and offload the heel completely, and redistribute the weight of the leg along the calf without putting pressure on the Achilles tendon. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = B (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Utilize support surfaces (on beds and chairs) to redistribute pressure. Pressure redistribution devices should serve as adjuncts and not replacements for repositioning protocols. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Place individuals who are at risk for pressure ulcers on a pressure redistribution surface. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider using the Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society (WOCN) Evidence- and Consensus-Based Support Surface Algorithm (http://algorithm.wocn.org) to identify the appropriate support surface (i.e., overlay, mattress, integrated bed system) for adults (&amp;ge;16 years of age) and bariatric patients in care settings where the length of stay is 24 hours or more. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Use a high specification reactive or alternating pressure support surface in the operating room for individuals at high risk for developing pressure ulcers. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = B (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Avoid foam rings, foam cut-outs, or donut-type devices for pressure redistribution because they concentrate pressure on the surrounding tissue. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Use incontinence skin barriers such as creams, ointments, pastes, and film-forming skin protectants as needed to protect and maintain intact skin in individuals who are incontinent and at risk for pressure ulcers. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Offer individuals with nutritional and pressure ulcer risks a minimum of 30&amp;ndash;35 kcalories per kg body weight per day, 1.25&amp;ndash;1.5 g of protein per kg body weight per day, and 1 ml of fluid intake per kcalorie per day. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Educate the patient/caregiver(s) about the causes and risk factors for developing pressure ulcers and ways to minimize the risk. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;32&quot;>
        <li>Float/elevate the heel(s) completely off the surface with a pillow or heel suspension device for stage 1 and 2 pressure ulcers or a heel suspension device for stage 3 and 4 heel pressure ulcers. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Turn and reposition the patient regularly and frequently. <strong><em>Level of Evidence = C (Benefit/Effectiveness/Harm = Class I)</em></strong> </li>

        <li>Modify the type of dressing as appropriate due to changes in the wound during healing or if the pressure ulcer deteriorates.

<p>The two primary authors of this guideline independently conducted systematic searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published in English from January 2010 through July 2015 relative to the search questions. The following medical subject headings (MESH) were used to search for each specific question related to pressure ulcers: pressure sore, decubitus ulcer, and bedsore.</p>
<p>The search targeted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective clinical trials, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. If available and relevant, national guidelines and published expert opinion were included to support opinion in areas that were clinically important where research was lacking or did not exist. Titles of references and abstracts were retrieved from the electronic searches and were screened for relevance to pressure ulcers and the search questions, and in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the initial screening, full-text articles were obtained that met the inclusion criteria. Additionally, some relevant studies were included that were identified from reference lists of selected articles.</p>

<p>From the selected full-text articles, the primary authors extracted the following data, which were compiled into evidence tables relative to each of the 13 search questions: source/citation (author, publication date, title, publication); type/design of study; sample (size, setting/location, description of subjects); intervention(s), outcome measures and length of follow up; results, including statistical significance of findings (<em>p</em> values, odds ratios [OR], hazard ratios [HR], confidence intervals [CI], sensitivity/ specificity, etc., as appropriate to the study); and limitations. For studies of diagnostic or screening tests, data included if a valid reference standard was used. For systematic reviews/meta-analyses, data included the number and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reviewed and the results.</p>
<p>Based on the judgment of the authors, studies were assessed as acceptable or unacceptable for inclusion and were excluded if there were methodological issues or insufficient detail to evaluate the results. Additionally, the primary authors rated the research (Level I&amp;ndash;VI) using criteria as identified in Table 1 of the original guideline document. Any differences of opinion about the quality/rating of the studies for inclusion in the guideline were resolved by discussion between the primary authors or by consensus after a review and discussion by the full task force.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Synthesis and Evaluation of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The two primary authors synthesized the data and prepared a descriptive narrative summary of the available evidence derived from the search and review of the literature. The guideline is organized into a topical outline format that addresses key content areas for assessment, prevention, and treatment of patients with or at risk for pressure ulcers. The summary of evidence derived from the review and evaluation of literature was integrated into the appropriate content sections of the guideline and a draft was presented to all task force members for review, discussion, clarification, and development of consensus. A series of conference calls was conducted during 2015 and early 2016 in which the task force reviewed/evaluated the evidence in the draft guideline until consensus was reached.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society (WOCN) developed this evidence-based guideline using the following process: (a) A task force of nurses from the WOCN Society's membership, representing a wide range of experience and clinical practice backgrounds, was convened to plan the guideline format; (b) in preparation for the update, task force members reviewed the 2010 guideline: outline/content, search questions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, scheme for rating the research evidence (see Table 1 in the original guideline document), and level-of-evidence ratings to classify the strength of recommendations (see Table 2 in the original guideline document); (c) after the initial review, two questions (number 5 and 13) were added to the search questions; and (d) the 13 questions were utilized to guide the literature search for evidence on the following topics related to pressure ulcers: assessment, prevention, and treatment.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on the evidence in the guideline, recommendations were developed for specific areas where evidence was sufficient to support the recommendation. In selected areas where evidence about clinically significant topics was lacking or did not exist, the recommendations were based on the consensus of expert opinion by the task force (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Level-of-Evidence Rating for Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Based on an appraisal of the strength of the evidence for recommendations in the guideline, a level-of-evidence rating (Level A, B or C) was assigned to specific recommendations (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). The rating refers to the strength of the evidence for a recommendation and does not relate to the importance of the recommendation. The rating system was adapted from the rating systems described by Sackett (1989), Cook et al. (1992), the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR)&amp;mdash;now called AHRQ (Bergstrom et al., 1992; Bergstrom et al., 1994), and the American College of Cardiology Foundation-American Heart Association (Hirsch et al., 2006).</p>
<p>The recommendations and level-of-evidence ratings were reviewed by the task force and discussed until consensus was reached. A narrative summary of the available evidence underlying the recommendations, along with the level-of-evidence are provided in the full text of the guideline, and the specific references that were included are cited in the text and the final reference list.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Benefit/Effectiveness versus Harm: Classification of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>To facilitate clinical decision making, the recommendations in the guideline were reviewed and classified by a consensus of the task force based on an assessment of the benefits/effectiveness versus a lack of benefit/effectiveness or harms of a procedure or treatment according to the evidence and/or expert opinion as presented in the guideline (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). The criteria used to classify recommendations according to benefit/effectiveness versus harm was developed from information described by Hirsch et al. (2006).</p></div>"/>

    <li>Caution is advised when considering &quot;body-worn&quot; products/briefs for fecal incontinence management because some products may contribute to the development of incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD). </li>
    <li>Due to concerns over side effects, resistance, and hypersensitivity reactions, the use of topical antibiotics is limited in pressure ulcers. </li>
    <li>Avoid using cleansing products or solutions in open wounds that are intended for use on intact skin and/or designed to remove fecal material; such products can be toxic to the wound bed. Also, when an antiseptic is added to a cleanser the toxicity increases. </li>
    <li>Wounds scrubbed with coarse sponges are significantly more at risk for infection than wounds scrubbed with softer sponges. </li>
    <li>Environmental contamination such as splashing is possible during pressurized irrigation/pulsatile lavage, and infection control precautions should be routinely followed, such as wearing protective clothing, gloves, and eyewear. </li>
    <li>Any of the debridement methods may increase the size of the pressure ulcer due to removal of the necrotic tissue. Conservative sharp debridement should be used with caution for individuals who are immunosuppressed, on anticoagulants, or have bleeding disorders. </li>
    <li>Leakage or strike-through of occlusive dressings can cause a break in the dressing barrier, which can expose the wound to external contamination. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Recently, the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) announced changes in the terminology and definitions for pressure ulcers and the staging system following a Staging Consensus Conference held April 8-9, 2016. Pressure ulcers were redefined as pressure injuries and the staging system definitions and illustrations were updated (see Appendix A in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Therefore, in the original guideline document the term pressure ulcer is considered equivalent/interchangeable with the term pressure injury. At present, these changes in terms and definitions are not universally adopted and may require some time for translation and assimilation into practice. Consequently, it will be important for healthcare providers to recognize that the updated terminology for pressure ulcers and staging may not align perfectly with that in the published literature and in current use by clinical and regulatory agencies. If there are discrepancies in terminology that is required for documentation by regulatory agencies (e.g., reimbursement, coding, quality reporting) and that in use in clinical practice, healthcare providers should seek guidance from the regulatory agency.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The recommendations in this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) were developed to be adopted and implemented by individual healthcare providers who care for patients with or at risk for pressure ulcers in various care settings. Strategies/plans to facilitate implementation and integration of the guideline's recommendations into clinical practice by members of the Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses (WOCN) Society and other healthcare providers include providing access to the information through publication and dissemination of the guideline in a print format and in a mobile application for iPads, iPhones, and iPods; provision of educational programs to increase awareness and knowledge of recommendations and their evidence base; and dissemination of the recommendations to a global audience through publication of the recommendations in the <em>Journal of Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nursing</em>.</p>
<p>The WOCN Society published and disseminated the print document via the Society's online bookstore <a href=&quot;http://www.wocn.org&quot; title=&quot;WOCN Society Web site&quot;>www.wocn.org</a>). Members were notified of the availability of the document by email and social media. To enhance providers' knowledge of the guideline and the new recommendations, an educational seminar was provided at the joint meeting of the WOCN Society and the Canadian Association of Enterostomal Therapists in Montreal, Canada on June 8, 2016. A webcast of the educational program was provided by live streaming, and a PowerPoint presentation of the updates to the CPG is available online (<a href=&quot;http://www.wocn.org/page/CEC&quot; title=&quot;WOCN Society Web site&quot;>http://www.wocn.org/page/CEC</a>). </p>
<p>To facilitate differential assessment of types of wounds as a basis for implementation of the recommendations for prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers, an algorithm for differential assessment of wounds accompanies the CPG (Appendix B). The algorithm serves as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points when caring for patients with a wound to guide the clinician in deciding which wound guideline is appropriate to consult for recommendations about care (i.e., CPG for pressure ulcer/injury; or venous, arterial, or diabetic/neuropathic wounds). Additionally, to facilitate implementation of the recommendations to select appropriate support surfaces to prevent/treat pressure ulcers (injuries), the WOCN Society has developed an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to guide clinicians in selecting support surfaces based on the individualized needs of the patient. An interactive, electronic version of the algorithm is available online (<a href=&quot;http://algorithm.wocn.org/#home&quot; title=&quot;WOCN Society Web site&quot;>http://algorithm.wocn.org/#home</a>), and a print copy was included in the CPG (Appendix J). The WOCN Society recognizes that for healthcare providers to adopt changes in practice, additional strategies will need to be developed to identify and address feasibility issues and barriers to implementation and integration of guideline recommendations into clinical practice in different care settings.</p></div>"/>
