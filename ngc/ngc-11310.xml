	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Clinical Question B3.a. <em>EGFR</em> Positive. What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with a sensitizing <em>EGFR </em>mutation who received a first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and experienced disease progression? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B3.a</em>: For patients with stage IV NSCLC with a sensitizing <em>EGFR </em>mutation and disease progression after first-line therapy with an EGFR-TKI and the presence of the T790M resistance mutation, clinicians should recommend osimertinib (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). If the T790M mutation is not present, clinicians may offer treatment with a platinum doublet (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation B3.b</em>: Patients who received an EGFR-TKI in the first-line setting, had an initial response, and subsequently experienced slow or minimal disease progression at isolated sites may continue EGFR-TKI with local therapy to the isolated sites (Type: informal consensus-based; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B6. <em>ROS1</em> Rearrangement. What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with <em>ROS1 </em>rearrangement?</strong></p>

<p><em>Recommendation B6.b. Patient who received prior crizotinib</em>: If patients have <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement and have received crizotinib in the first-line setting, then they may be offered platinum-based therapy in the second-line setting with or without bevacizumab (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B8. <em>BRAF</em> Mutations. What is the most effective therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC and <em>BRAF</em> mutations who have received prior chemotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B8</em>: Clinicians may offer atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab (if PD-L1 TPS &amp;gt;1%) in patients with <em>BRAF</em> mutations unless the patient received immune checkpoint therapy in the first-line setting (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak). If patients with <em>BRAF</em> mutations received immunotherapy in the second-line, clinicians may offer patients dabrafenib alone or in combination with trametinib in the third-line (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question C. Third-Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question C1. <em>EGFR</em> Negative. What is the most effective third-line therapy for patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC, negative or unknown tumor <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation or <em>ALK</em> or <em>ROS1</em> gene rearrangement status, and PS of 0 or 1 (or possibly PS of 2)?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clinical Question C2. <em>EGFR</em> Positive. What is the most effective third-line therapy for patients with a tumor <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation C2</em>: There are insufficient data to recommend immunotherapy in preference to chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) for patients with <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutations who have received at least one EGFR-TKI and subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy (Type: informal consensus based; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question D. Fourth-Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question D1. Is there a role for cytotoxic therapy in patients who have received three prior regimens and who have a good PS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation D1</em>: Data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for or against using cytotoxic drugs as fourth-line therapy; patients should consider experimental treatment, clinical trials, and continued best supportive (palliative) care. </p>

What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement, no <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement, negative or unknown <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation status, and PS 0 to 1 or possibly PS 2?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A6</em>: If patients have stage IV NSCLC with <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement, single-agent crizotinib is recommended, because it has shown some results indicating improved response rate and duration of response (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A7. Large-cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma. What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A7</em>: Patients with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma may receive the same treatment as other patients with NSCC or treatment with etoposide in platinum combinations (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A8. Elderly. What is the best chemotherapy for treatment of the elderly with stage IV NSCLC?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A8</em>: Decisions on the selection of chemotherapy should not be made or altered based on age alone (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A9. Maintenance. What is the optimal treatment for patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A9</em>: In patients with stage IV NSCLC, first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy should be stopped at disease progression or after four cycles in patients whose disease is stable but not responding to treatment; two-drug cytotoxic combinations should be administered for no more than six cycles. For patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of a first-line pemetrexed-containing regimen, continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed is recommended. For patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of a regimen that did not include a pemetrexed-containing combination, alternative single-agent chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous histology, docetaxel in unselected patients, or erlotinib in unselected patients, or a break from cytotoxic chemotherapy with initiation of second-line chemotherapy at disease progression may be recommended (Addition of pemetrexed: Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this guideline was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Thoracic Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p>The recommendations were developed by an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation using a systematic review (MEDLINE, February 2014 to December 2016) of phase II or III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical experience. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (many trials also included patients with stage IIIB NSCLC) </li>
    <li>Fully published presentations of English-language reports of phase II or III RCTs or meeting abstracts with fully available presentations </li>
    <li>Minimal sample size of 20 patients for immune checkpoint therapy or targeted therapy studies (50 patients for chemotherapy) </li>
    <li>Studies must have met enrollment targets </li>
    <li>Used intent-to-treat analysis for primary and secondary outcomes </li>
    <li>Independent determination of response </li>
    <li>For non-RCTs used to support recommendations, results must have been consistent </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; or published in a non-English language. </p>

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewer in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by one staff reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member.

<p>Study design aspects related to individual study quality, strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and risk of bias were assessed (Tables 4 and 5 in the original guideline document). Study quality was formally assessed for 15 (one set combined in assessment) trials identified by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Table 5 in the original guideline document. Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) assessed five studies separately, with slightly different methods (Table 4 in the original guideline document). Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one ASCO reviewer, with factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, and funding sources, generally indicating a low to intermediate potential risk of bias for most of the identified evidence.

<p>The Expert Panel met via teleconference and webinar and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. </p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines staff updated the literature search that was conducted to inform its recommendations on the systemic therapy of patients with stage IV NSCLC. MEDLINE was searched from February 2014 to December 2016. The updated search was restricted to articles published in English and to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. The updated search was guided by the signals approach, which is designed to identify only new, potentially practice-changing data&amp;mdash;signals&amp;mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on targeted routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO Expert Panel members to help identify potential signals. The ASCO Expert Panel and guidelines staff will work with the Steering Committee to keep abreast of any substantive updates to the guideline. Based on formal review of the emerging literature, ASCO will determine the need to update.</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations are crafted, in part, using the Guidelines Into Decision Support methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software. Ratings were made to the draft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; fields). In some selected cases where evidence is lacking, but there was a high level of agreement among the Expert Panel, informal consensus is used (as noted with the recommendations).</p>
<p>Detailed information about the methods used to develop this guideline update is available in the Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), including an overview (e.g., panel composition, development process, and revision dates); literature search and data extraction; the recommendation development process (GLIDES and BRIDGE-Wiz); and quality assessment.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The clinical practice guideline and other guidance published herein are provided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information herein should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating physician, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like &quot;must,&quot; &quot;must not,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating&amp;nbsp;provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information, or for any errors or omissions. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
