	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>A systematic review of the literature was performed in early 2015 to form the basis of the guideline. An analytic framework incorporating the population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO) was first used to develop and refine search strategies for each key question (KQ). The searches were conducted in MEDLINE PubMed and designed to identify studies published in English between January 1990 and December 2014 that evaluated adults with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) who were treated with primary radiation therapy (RT), adjuvant RT, or RT with concurrent systemic therapy. Both MeSH terms and text words were utilized and terms common to all searches included: <em>oropharyngeal neoplasms</em>, <em>carcinoma squamous cell</em>, and <em>radiotherapy</em>. Additional terms specific to each KQ were also incorporated. The outcomes of interest were overall and progression-free survival, recurrence rates, toxicity, and quality of life. The electronic searches were supplemented by hand searches.</p>
<p>A total of 2615 abstracts were retrieved. The articles were then reviewed by American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) staff, the co-chairs of the guideline, and the writing groups for each KQ. During the first round of screening, 2452 articles were eliminated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: patients 18 years or older, all stages of oropharyngeal cancer, and publication date 1990 to 2014. Included treatments were: primary RT, primary chemoradiation (CRT), primary surgery with adjuvant RT with or without systemic therapy, or induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by radiation therapy or CRT. The exclusion criteria were: pre-clinical or non-human studies, case reports/series, non-English language, available in abstract only, pediatric patients, distant metastasis, non-squamous cell carcinoma, and otherwise not clinically relevant to the key clinical questions. The panelists on KQ 1, 3 and 4 generally only considered articles in which the percentage of OPSCC patients was greater than 50%; the panelists on KQ2 did not have an absolute threshold because OPSCC patients typically comprise a minority of individuals in post-operative studies.</p></div>"/>

<p>In accordance with established American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) policy, the Guidelines Subcommittee recruited a guideline panel of recognized experts in oropharyngeal cancer, including radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, otolaryngologists, and a patient advocate. Panel members were drawn from academic settings, private practice, and residency. Four specific key questions (KQs) were proposed, which addressed: (KQ1) the addition of concurrent systemic therapy to RT, (KQ2) the delivery of post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) with and without systemic therapy following primary surgery, (KQ3) the use of induction chemotherapy (IC), and (KQ4) the optimal dose-fractionation regimens with and without systemic therapy, as well as nodal volumes for primary tonsillar cancer. In September 2014, the ASTRO Board of Directors approved the proposal and panel membership. </p>
<p>Through a series of communications by conference calls and emails between December 2014 and February 2016, the guideline panel, with ASTRO staff support, completed the systematic review, created literature tables, and formulated the recommendation statements and narratives for the guideline. The members of the task force were divided into four writing groups by KQs, according to their areas of expertise.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of Evidence and Recommendations and Consensus Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>Guideline recommendation statements were generated from this literature review, with high-quality evidence forming the basis of the statements whenever possible, in accordance with Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards; expert opinion supplemented the evidence base if high-level data were not available. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed in the construction and assessment of the recommendation statements. GRADE is an explicit, systematic approach to defining the recommendation strength and quality of evidence. </p>
<p>Recommendation strengths were dichotomized as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;conditional&quot; (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). &quot;When a recommendation is weak, clinicians and other health care providers need to devote more time to the process of shared decision making by which they ensure that the informed choice reflects individual values and preferences.&quot; The importance of patient preferences and shared decision-making was highlighted in each conditional recommendation statement.</p>
<p>The degree of consensus among the panelists on each recommendation statement was evaluated through a modified Delphi approach. A survey was sent by ASTRO staff to the panel members, who rated their agreement with each recommendation on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (higher score corresponds with stronger agreement). A pre-specified threshold of &amp;ge;75% of raters was determined to indicate when consensus was achieved. If a recommendation statement did not meet this threshold, it was modified and re-surveyed, or excluded from the guideline. The final set of recommendation statements were achieved after 2 surveys.</p></div>"/>

Although chemotherapy significantly increased acute toxicities, late effects were comparable to treatment with RT alone, such that the survival benefits of concurrent therapy clearly outweigh the non-trivial but short-term risks.
