	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>Should patients with imaging suggestive of low grade glioma undergo observation versus treatment involving a surgical procedure?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with imaging suggestive of a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II glioma (oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Surgical resection is recommended over observation to improve overall survival for patients with diffuse low grade glioma (<em>Level III</em>) although observation has no negative impact on cognitive performance and quality of life (<em>Level II</em>). </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>What is the impact of extent of resection on progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in low grade glioma patients?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with imaging suggestive of a WHO grade II glioma (oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p><em>Impact of Extent of Resection on PFS</em> </p>
<p><em>Level II</em>. It is recommended that gross total resection (GTR) or subtotal resection (STR) be accomplished instead of biopsy alone when safe and feasible so as to decrease the frequency of tumor progression recognizing that the rate of progression after GTR is fairly high. </p>
<p><em>Impact of Extent of Resection on OS </em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Greater extent of resection can improve OS in low grade glioma patients. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>What tools are available to increase extent of resection in low grade glioma patients?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with imaging suggestive of a WHO grade II glioma (oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) during Surgery</em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. The use of intraoperative MRI should be considered as a method of increasing the extent of resection of low grade gliomas.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>What is the impact of surgical resection on seizure control and accuracy of pathology in low grade glioma patients?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with imaging suggestive of a WHO grade II glioma (oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p><em>Surgical Resection and Seizure Control</em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. After taking into account the patient's clinical status and tumor location, gross total resection is recommended for patients with diffuse low grade glioma as a way to achieve more favorable seizure control. </p>
<p><em>Accuracy of Diagnosis </em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Taking into account the patient's clinical status and tumor location, surgical resection should be carried out to maximize the chance of accurate diagnosis. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question</span></strong> </p>
<p>What tools can improve the safety of surgery for low grade gliomas in eloquent locations?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong> </p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with imaging suggestive of a WHO grade II glioma (oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p><em>Preoperative Imaging </em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. It is recommended that preoperative functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging be utilized in the appropriate clinical setting to improve functional outcome after surgery for low grade glioma. </p>
<p><em>Intraoperative Mapping of Tumors in Eloquent Areas</em></p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. Intraoperative mapping is recommended for patients with diffuse low grade gliomas in eloquent locations compared to patients with non-eloquently located diffuse low grade gliomas as a way of preserving function. </p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Examination Approach</strong></p>
<p>A wide-ranging literature search strategy was undertaken to identify all citations relevant to the management of low grade gliomas. The MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from 1990 through 2012, with additional data being gleaned from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. The search strategies used a combination of subheadings and text words with the specifics of this work being outlined in each guideline section. Reference lists of the publications chosen for full text review were also screened for potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>The search of the bibliographic databases identified possibly relevant citations for a given topic and often these were large in number. The eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria to screen the citations for each of the questions were determined ahead of time for each section by the writing group. At least two authors evaluated the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria with broad interpretation of the criteria being used initially so as to maximize the likelihood of capturing pertinent information. Cases of disagreement about pertinence were resolved by a third author when needed. The full text articles of the selected abstracts were then collected and the same process of applying the eligibility criteria was carried out again with the more in depth information available. Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented so as to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Specific Search Strategy for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The following electronic databases were searched from 1990 to December 2012: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and abstracts from the annual meetings of the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO), American Association of Neurologic Surgeons (AANS), and Congress of Neurologic Surgeons (CNS). </p>
<p>For PubMed the following search strings were input: low grade glioma surgery, low grade glioma craniotomy, and low grade glioma observation. For the Cochrane Library, the following search strings were used: Surgery/ and Brain Neoplasms/, Low Grade Glioma/, and Low Grade Glioma/ and Surgery/. </p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>In order to be included, studies needed to be:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Published in English</li>
    <li>Involve patients with newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) grade II oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or oligo-astrocytoma or imaging suggestive of those diagnoses. In publications with mixed populations, the results of those with newly diagnosed WHO grade II tumor must be separable from others.</li>
    <li>Fully-published peer-reviewed studies or meeting abstracts from national neurosurgical meetings (AANS or CNS) or the SNO annual meeting</li>
    <li>Number of study participants with newly diagnosed WHO grade II tumor, or imaging suggestive of such a lesion, being five or higher</li>
    <li>Enrolled adult patients (18 years of age and older) or provide isolated results for adult patients in a mixed cohort that can be assessed separately</li>
</ol>
<p>Review or update articles were only read to make sure that pertinent studies they cited were captured during the PubMed search. The following exclusion criteria were applied to search results to obtain relevant articles for low grade glioma surgery: non-English publications, case series of less than 5 patients, new device articles, basic science papers, animal studies, high-grade glioma manuscripts, recurrent tumor articles, papers focusing exclusively on chemotherapy, papers focusing exclusively on radiation, anesthesia articles, pathologic analysis papers (e.g., immunohistochemical staining), papers studying pilocytic astrocytoma or ependymoma, and spinal cord tumors.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Two independent reviewers evaluated citations using a priori criteria for relevance and documented decisions in standardized forms. Cases of disagreement were resolved by a third reviewer. The same methodology was used for full-text screening of potentially relevant papers.</p></div>"/>

<p>Studies which met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by one reviewer and the extracted information was checked by one or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all of the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact filled manner so as to allow for understanding of the literature entry. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the scientific foundation of each section so as to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee Guideline Development Methodology document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing between writers electronically, by telephone and meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Panel Development</span> </strong></p>
<p>Recognizing the serious nature of low grade gliomas along with the lack of consensus among various treatment options, the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) recommended that evidence-based guidelines be developed as a top priority, for the diagnosis, management and treatment of low grade glioma patients. The objectives of these guidelines are to establish the best evidence-based management of low grade gliomas in terms of imaging diagnosis, use of surgical biopsy and resection, assessment of tumor pathology, administration of systemic chemotherapy, and administration of radiation therapy. Because these tumors dependably recur or progress despite standard therapy, the Joint Tumor Section also recommended an evidence-based guideline be developed for progressive low grade gliomas and that information on promising emerging therapies be assessed in the same manner to determine the possible application of these findings.</p>
<p>Having identified the topical objectives, the Guidelines Committee of the Joint Tumor Section then recruited experts in the field from each of the parent organizations as lead writers of each section. These writers, in turn, recruited experts in non-neurosurgical specialties relevant to the field of management and therapy chosen. Writers were provided training on the method of guideline development as used in this guideline set by written methods and instructions. The senior authors and CNS Guidelines Manager then worked with them on a step by step basis to confirm that the methods were followed as the literature was collected, assessed and documents developed. When writers were approached and preliminarily agreed to participate they were asked to complete a formal conflict of interest questionnaire confirming the appropriateness of their participation. At that point they also agreed to report any new conflicts of interest that might develop during the writing process. In this manner a multidisciplinary panel of writers referred to as the Low Grade Glioma Guidelines Task Force was assembled, with significant administrative, logistical and analytical support from the national CNS Guidelines Committee. The method of this evidence-based clinical practice parameter guideline has been written in a manner to be as transparent as possible using published assessment criteria.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Topic Range of This Systematic Review and Clinical Practice Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Having identified writing groups for each topic, the members designed questions to allow assessment of the literature in a manner that would provide guidance for management of low grade gliomas. These questions are presented at the beginning of each of the eight guideline chapters spanning the topics of imaging assessment, diagnostic biopsy, surgical resection, tumor evaluation by standard neuropathology and molecular techniques, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, emerging therapies and treatment of recurrent or progressive low grade gliomas.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise, in order to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>While the lack of class I evidence and limited examples of class II evidence restricts the Task Force's ability to definitively recommend surgery for low grade gliomas, the literature is supportive of several potential benefits of surgery for patients with diffuse low grade gliomas. The three examples of class II evidence support the lack of a negative impact from a wait and see approach on cognitive performance and quality of life, less frequent tumor progression with gross total resection (GTR) or subtotal resection (STR) compared to biopsy alone, and a surprisingly high rate of progression even after GTR. Most of the class III evidence supports a benefit of surgery on survival, with the impact of surgery being greater on progression-free survival (PFS) (with 17 of 19 [89%] studies supporting some benefit of surgery on PFS) than on overall survival (OS) (for with 26 of 34 [76%] studies supporting a benefit of surgery). Class III studies also promote benefits of surgery on seizure control and accuracy of pathology, and suggest that plasticity and neuro-monitoring can improve functional outcomes after surgery for low grade gliomas in eloquent locations. </p>
