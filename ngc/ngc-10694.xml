	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission (MS) on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this appraisal was prepared by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), the University of Sheffield (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Critique of the Methods of Review(s)</strong></p>
<p><em>Searches</em></p>
<p>The searches undertaken by the manufacturer to identify all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in March 2014. The search strategy utilised appropriate free text and medical subject heading terms to identify the condition (acute coronary syndrome [ACS]), the intervention (rivaroxaban) and the type of evidence (RCTs). Searches were further restricted to human and English language publications. Although the strategy is simple and effective, justification for adapting the published methodological RCT search filter (that was originally developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) was lacking. Several electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from inception. Although research registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register were not searched, three conference proceedings (American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology) were reviewed for relevant abstracts presented at meetings held in 2012 and 2013. Supplementary searches such as scanning of bibliographies of included studies, existing systematic reviews, manufacturer's database of trial protocols, clinical study reports and correspondence with regulatory bodies were also undertaken. The number of hits following a repeat of the electronic database search strategies for the identification of relevant rivaroxaban intervention studies on 28 July 2014 (see Section 6.1 in the MS) by the ERG, show numbers to be consistent with those reported in the MS. Whilst the ERG considers the search strategies to be comprehensive to retrieve important citations relating to all eligible studies of which the ERG and its clinical advisors are aware of, restricting the searches by English language can lead to publication bias.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>The MS describes an appropriate method of identifying and screening references for inclusion in the systematic review of rivaroxaban for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an ACS with elevated cardiac biomarkers. Two independent reviewers applied pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (via a two-stage sifting process) to citations identified by the searches. Any differences in selection were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. A summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as reported in the MS for the systematic review of rivaroxaban is summarised in Table 3 in the ERG report.</p>
<p>The specified inclusion and exclusion criteria were appropriate and generally reflect the information given in the decision problem.</p>
<p>Refer to the ERG report for additional details on the clinical effectiveness searches, including the search strategies used. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Description of Manufacturers Search Strategy and Comment on Whether the Search Strategy Was Appropriate</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer performed a literature search to identify published cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions for the secondary prevention of ACS events. The search was performed in March 2014 in several electronic bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Additional sources included UK Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Web sites (NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium) and conference proceedings of the American Heart Association scientific sessions (2012-13), European Society of Cardiology (2013), American College of Cardiology (2013) and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (2013). Appropriate filters were used to retrieve cost-effectiveness studies and details of searches for conference proceedings and of UK HTA Web sites were clearly reported.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Used in the Study Selection and Comment on Whether They Were Appropriate</em></p>
<p>The inclusion/exclusion criteria used in the manufacturer's study selection are provided in Table 10 in the ERG report. The search strategy was broad and covered many relevant interventions for ACS. Cost-effectiveness studies of ticagrelor and prasugrel were included in the systematic review even though they were not included in the final scope issued by NICE. This was because cost-effectiveness models for these interventions could provide useful information on costs and utilities of the health states in a <em>de novo</em> model, if developing one was required.</p>
<p>The ERG had some concerns about the country specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, as no rationale was provided for only identifying studies from the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. However, given the values used in the model it is unlikely that the country specific exclusion criteria lead to the exclusion of studies which contained parameters of greater relevance to the decision problem.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission (MS) on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this appraisal was prepared by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), the University of Sheffield (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Critique of Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The data extracted and presented in the MS clinical section appear appropriate and comprehensive. As noted in the manufacturer's response to a clarification question, data extraction was performed by one researcher and checked by a second. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus and if necessary, a third reviewer was consulted.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The validity assessment tool used to appraise the included studies in the MS was based on the minimum criteria for assessment of risk of bias in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as suggested by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. As noted in the manufacturer's response to a clarification question, methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed by one researcher and checked by a second. The ERG acknowledges that the validity assessment tool used in the MS was appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer did not undertake a formal meta-analysis as only one rivaroxaban RCT study was considered relevant to the submission. As a result, the manufacturer undertook a narrative synthesis of the evidence; however, no explicit details were provided on how this approach was undertaken. Ideally, a narrative synthesis approach should be pre-specified, justified, rigorous (i.e., describe results without being selective or emphasising some finding over others) and transparent to reduce potential bias. Despite the lack of transparency, the ERG acknowledges that the narrative synthesis approach undertaken by the manufacturer was acceptable.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 4 in the ERG report for additional information on clinical effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>As no cost-effectiveness studies comparing rivaroxaban plus aspirin with or without clopidogrel to aspirin with or without clopidogrel in the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were identified by the manufacturer, a <em>de novo</em> model was constructed.</p>
<p><strong>The Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer submitted a state transition cohort model written in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). The model used a time horizon of 40 years that was divided into two periods: an observation period which was intended to replicate the duration of the trial data and an extrapolation period. The extrapolation period started after 96 weeks and had a cycle length of 6 months. In the observation period the initial two cycles had a cycle length of 4 and 8 weeks respectively and the remaining cycles used a cycle length of 12 weeks. In the manufacturer's initial submission 96 weeks was assumed to last two years instead of 104 weeks. This discrepancy was introduced by assuming that cycle lengths of 12 weeks represented a quarter of a year (13 weeks).</p>
<p>In the manufacturer's response to a clarification question, it was established that these time cycles were chosen so that the model cycles matched the data collection points in the trial. It is unclear to the ERG why this was done, as in the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s base case Weibull curves were used to interpolate the data. Therefore the manufacturer could obtain transition probabilities between any two time points that they chose, not just the data collection points in the trial data.</p>
<p>In the base case, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are both discounted at a rate of 3.5% as recommended by NICE. Half cycle correction was performed on the Markov trace. The model structure is presented in Figure 5 of the ERG report,</p>
<p><strong>The Health States within the Model</strong></p>
<p>The model consisted of a number of health states corresponding to whether no further ACS event occurred or whether the patient suffered an ACS event. The ACS events considered in the model were: myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage; a bleeding event measured on the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scale; and revascularisation. These ACS events fell into two broad categories: those with longer term implications for the relative risks of developing further conditions, utility and costs; and those deemed to be transient events where the impacts were limited to one model cycle.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the company's economic model and the review and exploratory sensitivity analyses performed by the Evidence Review Group (ERG).</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was aware of the ERG's concerns about the structure of the company's economic model and, in particular, that the model is relatively inflexible. This meant that the ERG could not carry out all the exploratory analyses that it deemed potentially relevant. These included amendments to the hazard ratio for fatal bleeds and adjusting for the possibility of informative censoring.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable. The Committee did not draw any specific conclusions about the health-related quality of life benefits and utility values.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee did not identify specific groups of people for whom the technology is particularly cost effective.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable. The Committee did not draw any specific conclusions about the key drivers of cost effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio [ICER])</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the company's base case ICER was &amp;pound;6203 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and the ERG's preferred base case estimate was &amp;pound;5622 per QALY gained. It accepted that there is uncertainty about the validity of the results based on ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 because of the risk of bias resulting from missing data and informative censoring. However, the Committee considered that the ICERs presented were all within the range that could be considered cost effective and that the results of the ERG's exploratory sensitivity and scenario analyses suggested that the ICER was unlikely to increase to the extent that it would become unacceptable.</p></div>"/>
