<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A1</span></strong></p>
<p>Which patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should be treated with chemotherapy?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A1.a</strong></p>
<p>For patients with performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, a combination of two cytotoxic drugs is recommended. Platinum combinations are recommended over nonplatinum therapy; however, nonplatinum therapy combinations are recommended for patients who have contraindications to platinum therapy. Chemotherapy may also be used to treat selected patients with PS 2 who desire aggressive treatment after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of such treatment (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A1.b</strong></p>
<p>Because there is no cure for patients with stage IV NSCLC, early concomitant palliative care assistance has improved the survival and well being of patients and is therefore recommended (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A2</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with non-squamous cell carcinoma (NSCC), negative or unknown epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>)-sensitizing mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<em>ALK</em>) gene rearrangement status, and PS 0 to 1 or possibly PS 2?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A2</strong></p>
<p>For patients who have the characteristics described in Clinical Question A2 and who have nonsquamous histology, the following options are acceptable:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cisplatin-based combinations (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong)

<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status, NSCC, and no contraindications to bevacizumab?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A2.a.1</strong></p>
<p>For patients receiving carboplatin plus paclitaxel, the Update Committee recommends the addition of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, except for patients with SCC histologic type, clinically significant hemoptysis, inadequate organ function, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS &amp;gt;1, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, or medically uncontrolled hypertension. Bevacizumab may be continued, as tolerated, until disease progression (no change since 2011; type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A2.a.2</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence (for or against) to recommend pemetrexed in combination with bevacizumab plus carboplatin for patients who do not have contraindications to bevacizumab.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A2.b</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with PS 2, NSCC, and negative or unknown <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation and <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement status?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A2.b</strong></p>
<p>In the context of shared decision making, combination therapy, single-agent chemotherapy, or palliative therapy alone may be used for patients in this population with PS 2 (Chemotherapy: type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: weak; Palliative care: type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with an <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation and PS 0 to 1 or possibly PS 2?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A4</strong></p>
<p>If patients have stage IV NSCLC and a sensitizing <em>EGFR</em> mutation, first-line afatinib (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong), erlotinib (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong), or gefitinib (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong) is recommended.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A5</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement and PS 0 to 1 or possibly PS 2?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A5</strong></p>
<p>If patients have stage IV NSCLC and <em>ALK</em> rearrangements, first-line crizotinib is recommended (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A6</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement, no <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement, negative or unknown <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation status, and PS 0 to 1 or possibly PS 2?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A6</strong></p>
<p>If patients have stage IV NSCLC with <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement, single-agent crizotinib is recommended, because it has shown some results indicating improved response rate and duration of response (type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A7</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A7</strong></p>
<p>Patients with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma may receive the same treatment as other patients with NSCC or treatment with etoposide in platinum combinations (type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A8</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the best chemotherapy for treatment of the elderly with stage IV NSCLC?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A8</strong></p>
<p>Decisions on the selection of chemotherapy should not be made or altered based on age alone (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question A9</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the optimal treatment for patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A9</strong></p>
<p>In patients with stage IV NSCLC, first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy should be stopped at disease progression or after four cycles in patients whose disease is stable but not responding to treatment; two-drug cytotoxic combinations should be administered for no more than six cycles. For patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of a first-line pemetrexed-containing regimen, continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed is recommended. For patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of a regimen that did not include a pemetrexed-containing combination, alternative single-agent chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous histology, docetaxel in unselected patients, or erlotinib in unselected patients, or a break from cytotoxic chemotherapy with initiation of second-line chemotherapy at disease progression may be recommended (addition of pemetrexed: type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question B1</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status and NSCC?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B1</strong></p>
<p>For patients with advanced NSCLC, NSCC, negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status, and adequate PS, when disease has progressed during or after first-line platinum-based therapy, docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, or pemetrexed is acceptable as second-line therapy (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question B2</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status and SCC?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B2</strong></p>
<p>For patients with advanced NSCLC, SCC, negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status, and adequate PS, when disease has progressed during or after first-line platinum-based therapy, docetaxel, erlotinib, or gefitinib is acceptable as second-line therapy (type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question B3.a</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with a sensitizing <em>EGFR</em> mutation who received a first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and experienced disease progression?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B3.a</strong></p>
<p>For patients with a sensitizing <em>EGFR</em> mutation who did not respond to a first-line EGFR TKI, combination cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended (Recommendation A2), following the first-line recommendations for patients with NSCC (type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question B3.b</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with a sensitizing <em>EGFR</em> mutation who received a first-line EGFR TKI and experienced disease progression after an initial response?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B3.b</strong></p>
<p>Patients who received an EGFR TKI in the first-line setting, had an initial response, and subsequently experienced disease progression may be switched to chemotherapy or another EGFR TKI as second-line therapy (type: informal consensus, balance of benefits and harms; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question B4</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with <em>ALK</em> rearrangement with progression after first-line crizotinib?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B4</strong></p>
<p>Patients whose tumors have <em>ALK</em> rearrangements and who received crizotinib in the first-line setting may be offered the option of chemotherapy (after first-line recommendations for patients with NSCC [see Recommendation A2]) or ceritinib in the second-line setting (Chemotherapy: type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong; Ceritinib: type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question B5</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the optimal second-line treatment for elderly patients with stage IV NSCLC?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B5</strong></p>
<p>The evidence does not support the selection of a specific second-line chemotherapy drug or combination based on age alone. This recommendation has not changed. As stated in Recommendation A8, age alone is not a contraindication to chemotherapy for NSCLC.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question C</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a role for third-line therapy or beyond in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation C1</strong></p>
<p>When disease progresses during or after second-line chemotherapy, treatment with erlotinib may be recommended as third-line therapy for patients with a PS of 0 to 3 who have not received prior erlotinib or gefitinib (no change).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation C2</strong></p>
<p>Data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for or against using cytotoxic drugs as third-line therapy; patients should consider experimental treatment, clinical trials, and continued best supportive (palliative) care (no change from previous recommendations).</p>

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewer in consultation with the Steering Committee. Data were extracted by one staff reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the original guideline document and/or in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly relevant to current recommendations. Quality assessment of studies not directly cited in support of recommendations is available in the Data Supplement. Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer, with factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, and funding sources generally indicating an intermediate to high potential risk of bias for most of the identified evidence. Some factors varied between studies, lowering the comparability of the results. The &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field provides definitions of ratings for overall potential risk of bias.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, nuclear and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Committee was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline, the Co-Chairs selected two additional members from the Update Committee to form a Steering Committee to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts. Update Committee members are listed in Appendix Table A1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee met by webinar on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Update Committee participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) for peer review and consideration for publication. All ASCO guidelines are reviewed and approved by the ASCO CPGC prior to publication.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software<sup>TM</sup>. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners, survivors of cancer, and caregivers and the need to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and are also often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
