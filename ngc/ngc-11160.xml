	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Is Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Comparable with the Current Standard (Intracarotid Amobarbital Procedure [IAP]) for Measuring Language Lateralization?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>fMRI may be considered as an option in lateralizing language functions in place of IAP in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) (<strong>Level C</strong>), temporal epilepsy in general (<strong>Level C</strong>), or extratemporal epilepsy (<strong>Level C</strong>), although patients should be carefully advised of the risks and benefits of fMRI versus IAP during discussions of modality choice in each individual case. The evidence is unclear for patients with temporal neocortical epilepsy or temporal tumors (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Can fMRI Predict Postsurgical Language Outcomes in Patients with Epilepsy Undergoing Brain Surgery?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>fMRI may be considered for predicting postsurgical language outcomes after anterior temporal lobe (ATL) resection for the control of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Is fMRI Comparable with the Current Standard (IAP) for Measuring Memory Lateralization?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>fMRI may be considered as an option to lateralize memory functions in place of IAP in patients with MTLE (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Can fMRI Predict Postsurgical Verbal Memory Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Temporal Lobectomy?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Presurgical fMRI of verbal memory or of language encoding should be considered as an option to predict verbal memory outcome in patients with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for left MTL surgery (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Can fMRI Predict Postsurgical Nonverbal (Visuospatial) Memory Outcomes in Patients with Epilepsy Undergoing Medial Temporal Lobectomy?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Presurgical fMRI using nonverbal memory encoding may be considered as a means to predict visuospatial memory outcomes in patients with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for temporal lobe surgery (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Is There Sufficient Evidence in Terms of Diagnostic Accuracy and Outcome Prediction for fMRI to Replace the IAP (Wada Test) in Presurgical Evaluation for Epilepsy Surgery?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><em>Language</em></p>
<p>Presurgical fMRI may be used instead of the IAP for language lateralization in patients with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for brain surgery (<strong>Level C</strong>). However, when fMRI is used for this purpose, task design, data analysis methods, and epilepsy type (temporal vs extratemporal, lesional vs nonlesional) need to be considered. Of particular importance for patients with lesional epilepsy is the fact that only small numbers of participants with variable lesion size/location were included in previous studies.</p>
<p><em>Memory</em></p>
<p>fMRI of language and verbal memory lateralization may be an alternative to IAP memory testing for prediction of verbal memory outcome in MTLE (<strong>Level C</strong>). fMRI is not yet established as an alternative to the IAP for prediction of global amnesia in patients who have undergone anterior temporal lobe (ATL) surgery.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Accuracy Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class I</span></p>
<p>A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class II</span></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study with a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data were collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class III</span></p>
<p>A case-control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><em>Prognostic Accuracy Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class I</span></p>
<p>A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class II</span></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class III</span></p>
<p>A case-control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt; 5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p></div>"/>

<p><em>Class I</em></p>
<p>A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Class II</em></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study with a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data were collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Class III</em></p>
<p>A case-control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Prognostic Accuracy Scheme</strong></p>
<p><em>Class I</em></p>
<p>A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Class II</em></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor.

Where this appeared to be the case, only data from the most recent publication were examined, except when the earlier report included analyses not performed in the later report. Two panelists working independently of each other rated each of the included articles according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) diagnostic and prognostic classification of evidence schemes (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Differences in ratings were arbitrated by a third panel member until a consensus among the 3 reviewers was achieved. Additional review of all included articles was performed by the study methodologist to confirm adherence to the classification scheme. Because it is unclear whether the results of fMRI studies can be combined for seizure foci in different brain localizations (owing to possible function reorganization), the articles were also reviewed to determine whether the results could be analyzed separately for patients with medial and lateral temporal (temporal neocortical), temporal (if not divided into medial and lateral), and extratemporal epilepsies.

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.</p>
