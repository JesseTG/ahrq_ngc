	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For patients who were diagnosed with a small renal mass (SRM), when is renal tumor biopsy (RTB) indicated? What is the contemporary accuracy and complication profile of RTB?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.0</em>: On the basis of tumor-specific findings and competing risks of mortality, all patients with an SRM should be considered for RTB when the results may alter management (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In patients with an SRM, is there an age limit at which active surveillance is a better option than surgical resection or thermal ablation? Is there an anticipated life expectancy for which active surveillance is a better option than surgical intervention or thermal ablation? Are patients with significant and active medical comorbidities&amp;mdash;that is, chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&amp;mdash;better treated with active surveillance than surgical intervention or ablation?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.0</em>: Active surveillance should be an initial management option for patients who have significant comorbidities and limited life expectancy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p>Qualifying statement: absolute indication: high risk for anesthesia and intervention or life expectancy &amp;lt;5 years; relative indication: significant risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if treated, SRM (&amp;lt;1 cm), or life expectancy &amp;lt;10 years.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In patients with an SRM, what are the optimal indications for undergoing partial nephrectomy (PN), radical nephrectomy, or thermal ablation? What is the impact of these procedures on renal function?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: PN for SRMs is the standard treatment that should be offered to all patients in whom an intervention is indicated and who possess a tumor that is amenable to this approach (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: Percutaneous thermal ablation should be considered an option for patients that possess tumors such that complete ablation will be achieved. A biopsy should be obtained before or at the time of ablation (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: Radical nephrectomy for SRMs should only be reserved for patients who possess a tumor of significant complexity that is not amenable to PN or for whom PN may result in unacceptable morbidity even when performed at centers with expertise. Referral to a surgeon and a center with experience in PN should be considered (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4</em>: Referral to a nephrologist should be considered for patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &amp;lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m&amp;sup2;) or progressive CKD after treatment, especially if associated with proteinuria (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, nephrology, nuclear and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>An Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation met via teleconference and/or webinar and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize guideline recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline.</p>
<p>Guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&amp;trade;. This method helps Guideline Expert Panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Expert Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p>In addition, a guideline implementability review was conducted. On the basis of the implementability review, revisions were made to the draft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation.</p>
<p>In some selected cases in which evidence is lacking but there was a high level of agreement among Expert Panel members, informal consensus is used (as noted in the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

    <li>PN is associated with an excellent cancer-specific survival rate, but carries a certain potential for treatment-related complications, which is greatest among the surgical treatment options for small renal masses (SRMs). </li>
    <li>In addition to medical comorbidities, renal mass location and size seem to be associated with complication rates after ablation. The benefits and risks of ablation should be carefully weighed for centrally located masses or those in close proximity to structures such as ureters, ureteropelvic junction, small or large bowel, or nerves. </li>
    <li>Perioperative outcomes, such as length of hospital stay, estimated blood loss, and open surgical conversion, favor thermal ablation relative to surgical options. Meta-analysis of percutaneous and surgical (open or laparoscopic) ablation strategies reveals a lower major complication rate for percutaneous ablation. </li>
    <li>The most significant drawback of radical nephrectomy is the detrimental impact on kidney function and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) after treatment. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, as well as to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
