	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>,<strong> B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>,<strong> U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I</strong>-<strong>IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Practice Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d has significant benefit in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) management and should be considered the optimal prednisone dose. Prednisone 10 mg/kg/weekend is equally effective over a 12-month period, although long-term outcomes of this alternate regimen remain to be seen. Because of the expectation of significant adverse events (AEs) with corticosteroids, proper informed consent is required, and AEs should be discussed with patients and their families prior to therapy initiation and should be managed proactively. The American College of Rheumatology Task Force osteoporosis guideline recommends calcium and vitamin D supplementation for patients taking corticosteroids (any dose with an anticipated duration of &amp;ge;3 months) in order to maintain a total calcium intake of 1,200 mg/d and vitamin D intake of 800 IU/d through dietary sources and supplementation.</p>
<p>If a significant number of AEs develop, reducing the prednisone dose to 0.3 mg/kg/d may reduce the AE burden, albeit with less efficacy.</p>
<p>The AE profiles of deflazacort and prednisone vary slightly. Weight gain and cushingoid appearance may occur more frequently with prednisone than deflazacort, but cataracts are more frequently reported with deflazacort.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Prednisone, offered as an intervention for patients with DMD:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Should be used to improve strength (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may be used to improve timed motor function (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Should be used to improve pulmonary function (<strong>Level B</strong>) </li>
    <li>May be used to reduce the need for scoliosis surgery (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>May be used to delay the onset of cardiomyopathy by 18 years of age (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Deflazacort, offered as an intervention for patients with DMD, may be used to:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Improve strength and timed motor function and delay the age at loss of ambulation by 1.4&amp;ndash;2.5 years (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Improve pulmonary function (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Reduce the need for scoliosis surgery (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Delay the onset of cardiomyopathy by 18 years of age (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Increase survival at 5 and 15 years of follow-up (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Deflazacort and prednisone may be equivalent in improving motor function (<strong>Level C</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to establish a difference in effect on cardiac function (<strong>Level U</strong>). Prednisone may be associated with increased weight gain in the first years of treatment compared with deflazacort (<strong>Level C</strong>). Deflazacort may be associated with increased risk of cataracts compared with prednisone (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>If patients with DMD are treated with prednisone, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d should be the preferred dosing regimen (<strong>Level B</strong>). Prednisone 10 mg/kg/weekend is equally effective over 12 months, but long-term outcome is not yet established. Prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d is probably associated with significant risk of weight gain, hirsutism, and cushingoid appearance (<strong>Level B</strong>), with equal side effect profile seen over 12 months with the 10 mg/kg/weekend dosing.</p>
<p>Prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/d may be used as an alternative dosing regimen with lesser efficacy and fewer AEs (<strong>Level C</strong>). Prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d is another alternative regimen; it may be equivalent to 0.75 mg/kg/d but may be associated with more AEs (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute the following (<strong>all Level U</strong>):</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The addition of calcifediol and bisphosphonates (alendronate) as significant interventions for improving bone health in patients with DMD taking prednisone </li>
    <li>A benefit of bisphosphonates for improving survival in patients with DMD taking corticosteroids </li>
    <li>A benefit of prednisone for survival </li>
    <li>A significant difference in efficacy or AE rates among daily, alternate day, and intermittent regimens for prednisone or prednisolone dosing </li>
    <li>A preferred dose of deflazacort </li>
    <li>An effect of corticosteroids on quality of life (QoL) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Counseling</strong></p>
<p>The following suggestions for counseling are the opinion of the authors and extend from logical conclusions of the recommendations.</p>
<p>Patients with DMD and their families should:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Have a voice in the choice of the corticosteroid used, noting that the various corticosteroids differ in evidence supporting use, cost, availability, and AE profiles. When a corticosteroid has been agreed upon, a focused discussion of the risks particular to that corticosteroid should take place. </li>
    <li>Be informed of the risks and benefits of adding a bisphosphonate to corticosteroid treatment. </li>
</ul>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. The AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology </em>peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
