	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based, Formal consensus, Informal consensus, No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) indicated in patients with T1-2 tumors with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes who undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendations</em></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1a</em>. The panel unanimously agreed that the available evidence shows that PMRT reduces the risks of locoregional failure (LRF), any recurrence, and breast cancer mortality for patients with T1-2 breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). However, some subsets of these patients are likely to have such a low risk of LRF that the absolute benefit of PMRT is outweighed by its potential toxicities (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). In addition, the acceptable ratio of benefit to toxicity varies among patients and physicians. Thus, the decision to recommend PMRT or not requires a great deal of clinical judgment. The panel agreed clinicians making such recommendations for individual patients should consider factors that may decrease the risk of LRF, attenuate the benefit of reduced breast cancer&amp;ndash;specific mortality, and/or increase the risk of complications resulting from PMRT. These factors include: patient characteristics (e.g., age &amp;gt;40 to 45 years, limited life expectancy because of older age or comorbidities, or coexisting conditions that might increase the risk of complications), pathologic findings associated with a lower tumor burden (e.g., T1 tumor size, absence of lymphovascular invasion, presence of only a single positive node and/or small size of nodal metastases, or substantial response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy [NAST]), and biologic characteristics of the cancer associated with better outcomes and survival and/or greater effectiveness of systemic therapy (e.g., low tumor grade or strong hormonal sensitivity) (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). There are several risk-adaptive models that physicians may find useful in explaining the benefits of PMRT during shared decision making with patients. However, the panel found insufficient evidence to endorse any specific model or to unambiguously define specific patient subgroups to which PMRT should not be administered (Type: no recommendation; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak). Further research is needed on how to accurately estimate individuals' risk of LRF and hence their potential reductions in LRF and breast cancer mortality.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1b</em>. The decision to use PMRT should be made in a multidisciplinary fashion through discussion among providers from all treating disciplines early in a patient's treatment course (soon after surgery or before or soon after the initiation of systemic therapy), either in the context of a formal tumor board or by referral (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1c</em>. Decision making must fully involve the patient, whose values as to what constitutes sufficient benefit and how to weigh the risk of complications against this in light of the best information the treating physicians can provide regarding PMRT in her situation must be respected and incorporated into the final treatment choice (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is PMRT indicated in patients with T1-2 tumors and a positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB) who do not undergo completion ALND?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>. For patients with clinical T1-2 tumors with clinically negative nodes, SNB is now generally performed at the time of mastectomy, with omission of ALND if the nodes are negative. ALND has generally been performed if the nodes are positive, but there is increasing controversy about whether this is always necessary, especially if there is limited disease in the affected nodes. The panel recognizes that some clinicians omit axillary dissection with one or two positive sentinel nodes in patients treated with mastectomy. This practice is primarily based on extrapolation of data from randomized trials of patients treated exclusively or predominantly with breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation or breast plus axillary irradiation. In such cases where clinicians and patients elect to omit axillary dissection, the panel recommends that these patients receive PMRT only if there is already sufficient information to justify its use without needing to know that additional axillary nodes are involved (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: weak; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is PMRT indicated in patients with clinical stage I or II cancers who have received NAST?</strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation</em>. Patients with axillary nodal involvement that persists after NAST (e.g., less than a complete pathologic response) should receive PMRT. Observational data suggest a low risk of locoregional recurrence for patients who have clinically negative nodes and receive NAST or who have a complete pathologic response in the lymph nodes with NAST. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend whether PMRT should be administered or can be routinely omitted in these groups. The panel recommends entering eligible patients in clinical trials that examine this question (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should regional nodal irradiation (RNI) include both the internal mammary nodes (IMNs) and supraclavicular-axillary apical nodes when PMRT is used in patients with T1-2 tumors with one to three positive axillary nodes?</strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation</em>. The panel recommends treatment generally be administered to both the IMNs and the supraclavicular-axillary apical nodes in addition to the chest wall or reconstructed breast when PMRT is used for patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. There may be subgroups that will experience limited, if any, benefits from treating both these nodal areas compared with treating only one or perhaps treating only the chest wall or reconstructed breast. There is insufficient evidence at this time to define such subgroups in detail. Additional research is needed to identify them (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updating. This approach is intended to identify new, potentially practice-changing data that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on targeted literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. The Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provides additional information about the signals approach.</p>
<p>The 2014 publication of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis provided the signal for this focused update.</p>
<p>The Expert Panel developed its recommendations based on evidence identified through online searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Pubmed databases. Details of the searches are provided in the Data Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The systematic review of literature by the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) of locoregional therapy for locally advanced breast cancer guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provided the primary evidentiary basis for the ASCO guideline focused update. The CCO literature searches identified systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and clinical practice guidelines that studied locoregional therapy for locally advanced breast cancer. For studies to be included in the analysis, the CCO required them to have at least 50 patients, have a prospective design, and provide a statistical comparison of the interventions of interest. At the request of ASCO, CCO guideline staff conducted an updated search of the CCO systematic review. The yield from the updated CCO search was reviewed for new, potentially practice-changing data.</p>
<p>Two additional targeted searches were conducted by the ASCO Guidelines Division staff to identify systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in women who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and of technical aspects of PMRT, especially regional nodal irradiation (RNI). A third targeted literature search and review was conducted to identify single-center and multi-institutional prospective and retrospective studies of patients treated since the PMRT trials in the EBCTCG meta-analysis were completed. Inclusion criteria for this targeted review were: retrospective or prospective study published between January 2001 and July 2015, patients accrued from 1985 or later, 150 or more patients explicitly identified with T1-2 cancers with one to three positive nodes, patients not treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and median follow-up 48 months or longer.</p>
<p>The original CCO literature searches identified 6482 references, and the revised search (December 2011) found 23,629 additional references. The final updates (August and December 2013) found an additional 12,027 citations. Additional references (mostly results of older trials on postmastectomy radiotherapy [PMRT]) were located from the reference lists of included studies and recent reviews.</p>

<p><strong>Synthesizing the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When two or more trials provided appropriate data on outcomes of interest, statistical pooling using meta-analysis was done using Review Manager software (RevMan 5.1) (58) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. A random effects model was used for all pooling because it provides a more conservative estimate. Pooled results are expressed as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A RR of less than one favours the drug/supplement and an RR of greater than one favours the placebo or control intervention.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, and community oncology. The panel included a member of Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting and a single webinar. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel.</p>
<p>For this joint ASCO-American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)-Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) focused guideline update, ASTRO and SSO each provided two formal representatives.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The full Expert Panel met on two occasions and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>

    <li>Risks of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) include acute and long-term toxicities, such as rare but potentially fatal second cancers and cardiac events. </li>
    <li>Treating the supraclavicular and internal mammary node (IMN) areas can result in additional toxicities, with pulmonary and cardiac morbidities being particular concerns even with improved radiotherapy techniques. Additional analyses of these trials and other studies are needed to determine which patients should undergo irradiation of only one or neither of these areas. </li>
    <li>In general, the full axilla is not irradiated in those who have had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), because recurrence in the dissected axilla is rare, and its inclusion may further increase toxicities, particularly lymphedema. </li>
    <li>Furthermore, many more patients now undergo breast reconstructive surgery. Administration of PMRT can worsen cosmetic results and increase the risk of both short- and long-term complications. </li>
