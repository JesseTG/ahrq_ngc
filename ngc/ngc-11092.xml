	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Airway Management</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What are the indications for intubation and extubation in large hemispheric infarction (LHI)? </li>
    <li>What is the best timing for tracheostomy in LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>LHI patients with signs of respiratory insufficiency or neurological deterioration should be intubated immediately (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>Extubation should be attempted in LHI patients who meet the following criteria, even if communication and cooperation cannot be established (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Successful spontaneous breathing trials </li>
        <li>Absence of oropharyngeal saliva collections </li>
        <li>Absence of demand for frequent suctioning </li>
        <li>Presence of cough reflex and tube intolerance </li>
        <li>Free of analgesia and sedation </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Tracheostomy should be considered in LHI patients failing extubation or in whom extubation is not feasible by 7 to 14 days from intubation (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Hyperventilation</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Does hyperventilation effectively treat increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend against prophylactic hyperventilation in LHI patients (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest using hyperventilation for short period of time as a rescue maneuver in LHI patients showing clinical signs of brain herniation (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Analgesia and Sedation</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Should analgesia and/or sedation be administered in LHI patients? If so, which pharmacologic agents should be used? </li>
    <li>Are daily wake-up trials recommended? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend analgesia and sedation if signs of pain, anxiety, or agitation arise in LHI patients (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend the lowest possible sedation intensity and earliest possible sedation cessation, while avoiding physiologic instability and discomfort in LHI patients (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend against the routine use of daily wake-up trials in LHI patients. Caution is particularly warranted in patients prone to ICP crises. Neuromonitoring of at least ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is recommended to guide sedation, and daily wake-up trials should be abandoned or postponed at signs of physiological compromise or discomfort (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Gastrointestinal Tract</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>How should dysphagia be assessed in LHI patients? </li>
    <li>When should LHI patients receive a nasogastric tube? </li>
    <li>When should LHI patients receive a percutaneous enterogastric tube? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest dysphagia screening in the early phase of LHI. Dysphagia can be assessed once the patient is weaned from sedation and ventilation (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>LHI patients with dysphagia should receive a nasogastric tube as soon as possible (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that high National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and persisting dysphagia on endoscopic swallowing should prompt discussion with the family on placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube between weeks 1 and 3 of the intensive care unit (ICU) stay (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Glucose Control</span></strong></p>
<p>How should glucose be controlled in LHI patients?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia should be avoided in LHI. Intermediate glycemic control (serum glucose level 140&amp;ndash;180 mg/dL) should be the target of insulin therapy in LHI patients (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that intravenous sugar solutions should be avoided in LHI (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Hemoglobin Control</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the optimal hemoglobin level in LHI patients? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend maintaining a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL or higher in LHI patients (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should also consider specific situations such as planned surgery, hemodynamic status, cardiac ischemia, active significant bleeding, and arteriovenous oxygen extraction compromise when determining the ideal hemoglobin for a patient (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>Consider reducing blood sampling wherever possible in order to decrease the risk of anemia in LHI (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Deep Venous Thrombosis Prophylaxis</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>How should deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis be administered to LHI patients? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend early mobilization to prevent DVT in hemodynamically stable LHI patients with no evidence of increased ICP (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend DVT prophylaxis for all LHI patients upon admission to the ICU and for the duration of immobilization (<em>strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend using intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) for DVT prophylaxis (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for DVT prophylaxis (<em>strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend against the use of compression stockings for DVT prophylaxis (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Anticoagulation</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>If LHI is due to a cardioembolic mechanism or if the patient has high thromboembolic risk, when should anticoagulation be initiated after LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest that oral anticoagulation be reinitiated 2 to 4 weeks after LHI in patients at high thromboembolic risk (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that earlier re-initiation of oral anticoagulation should be based on clinical risk assessment and additional diagnostic tests (e.g., prosthetic valve, acute DVT, acute pulmonary embolism (PE), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showing intracardiac thrombus) (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest using aspirin during the period of no anticoagulation in LHI with atrial fibrillation (AF) or increased thromboembolic risk, provided surgery is not imminent (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Blood Pressure Management</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the optimal blood pressure in LHI patients? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend that clinicians follow current blood pressure management guidelines for ischemic stroke in general when caring for LHI patients. Maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) &amp;gt;85 mm Hg in ischemic stroke without hemorrhagic transformation. Lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to &amp;lt;220 mm Hg (<em>strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest avoiding blood pressure variability, especially in the early phase of LHI treatment (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend against using steroids for brain edema in patients with LHI (<em>strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Barbiturate therapy is not recommended in patients with LHI because the risks outweigh the benefits (<em>strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest considering hypothermia as a treatment option in patients who are not eligible for surgical intervention (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>If hypothermia is considered, the authors suggest a target temperature of 33&amp;deg; to 36&amp;deg; Celsius for duration of 24 to 72 hours (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest maintaining normal core body temperature (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the optimal head position in patients with LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest a horizontal body position in most patients with LHI. However in patients with increased ICP, they suggest a 30&amp;ordm; backrest elevation (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Osmotic Therapy</span></strong></p>

    <li>Does osmotic therapy effectively treat brain edema and improve outcome in LHI? </li>
    <li>What are the potential complications associated with the use of these agents? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend using mannitol and hypertonic saline for reducing brain edema and tissue shifts in LHI only when there is clinical evidence of cerebral edema (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest using osmolar gap instead of serum osmolality to guide mannitol dosing and treatment duration <em>(weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>Hypertonic saline dosing should be guided by serum osmolality and serum sodium (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend using mannitol cautiously in patients with acute renal impairment (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend using hypertonic saline cautiously in patients with volume overload states (i.e., heart failure, cirrhosis, etc.) since this agent will expand intravascular volume (<em>strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>

    <li>Can neuroimaging by CT or MRI predict neurological deterioration and &quot;malignant&quot; course after LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend using early changes on CT and MRI to predict malignant edema after LHI (<em>strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>

    <li>What is the value of transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCS) sonography for the prediction of malignant course after LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest using TCCS as a complementary test to predict malignant course and possibly as a primary test if the patient is too unstable to be transferred outside the ICU for neuroimaging (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evoked Potentials</span></strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest considering brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) as a complementary method to predict malignant course within the first 24 h after middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction, particularly in patients too unstable to be transported to neuroimaging (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest considering EEG in the first 24 h after stroke to assist with predicting clinical course in LHI (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that continuous and quantitative EEG represent a promising non-invasive monitoring technique and a tool for estimation of prognosis after LHI that might be useful in the future pending further study (<em>weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence</em>). </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Invasive multimodal monitoring has not been sufficiently studied, and therefore cannot be recommended in the routine management of LHI (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Should decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) be offered to patients with LHI? </li>
    <li>What are the selection criteria for DHC in LHI? </li>
    <li>What is the optimal timing and size for DHC? </li>
    <li>Should age and hemispheric dominance play a role in the decision to offer DHC to LHI patients? </li>
    <li>Should temporal lobectomy or duraplasty be offered as an adjunct therapy to DHC? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors recommend DHC as a potential therapy to improve survival after LHI regardless of patient age (<em>strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>In patients older than 60 years, the authors recommend taking in consideration patients and family wishes, since in this age group, DHC can reduce mortality rate but with a higher likelihood of being severely disabled (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>There is currently insufficient data to recommend against DHC in LHI patients based on hemispheric dominance (<em>strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>To achieve the best neurological outcome, the authors recommend performing DHC within 24 to 48 h hours of symptom onset and prior to any herniation symptoms (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors recommend a size of 12 cm as an absolute minimum for DHC. Larger sizes of 14 to 16 cm seem to be associated with better outcomes (<em>strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that lobectomy or duraplasty should only be considered as an individualized treatment option (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that the resection of the temporal muscle should only be considered as an individualized treatment option (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Ethical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is the reduction of mortality after DHC achieved at the expense of functional dependency? </li>
    <li>Is modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 4 considered a desirable outcome after LHI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest that the decision to perform DHC should depend on values and preferences of patients and relatives regarding survival and dependency (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quality of Life (QoL)</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is survival after LHI associated with good QoL? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The authors suggest that future research use QoL as an outcome measure in LHI patients (<em>weak recommendation, low quality of evidence</em>). </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>A committee identified topics of interest based on clinical decision points in the critical care management of large hemispheric infarction (LHI) patients. The committee recruited European and North American experts from the fields of neurosurgery, neurocritical care, neurology, interventional neuroradiology, and neuroanesthesiology, and divided them into different subtopic-related panels based on expertise. Each panel performed a critical literature review and summarized the findings in tables; draft recommendations were prepared based on this data. Before the conference, this draft information was distributed to the larger group of conference participants.</p>
<p>For each clinical question, the panel assessed the quality of the data and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The panel graded the quality of the evidence as very low, low, moderate, or high (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The panel considered quality of evidence in terms of the likelihood that the further research would change their level of confidence in the estimate of effect for an intervention.</p>
<p>The GRADE system classifies recommendations as strong or weak, according to the quality of evidence, the balance between risks and benefits, patient preferences, and cost considerations (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). Evaluating each of these components individually and explicitly is a defining feature of this guideline system. One advantage of GRADE is that it allows for strong recommendations in the setting of lower quality evidence, as long as there are other mitigating factors.</p>
<p>At the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) annual meeting in October 2012, each panel member presented a summary of the data and recommendations to the group. The committee met again in Mannheim, Germany on January 23&amp;ndash;26, 2013 during the German Society for Neuro-Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine annual meeting. The committee reviewed key studies and the recommendations made by individual panel members. The final questions were reviewed at the conference and feedback was obtained from a larger auditorium of interdisciplinary neurocritical care practitioners.</p></div>"/>

    <li>There is a risk of bleeding from heparin and warfarin. </li>
    <li>Although some studies found hypothermia to be generally safe, hypotension, hematologic effects, and infections were common side effects. It is also important to keep in mind the potential side effects of hypothermia such as pneumonia and coagulopathy. </li>
    <li>Mannitol should be used cautiously in patients with acute renal impairment. </li>
    <li>Hypertonic saline should be used cautiously in patients with volume overload states (i.e., heart failure, cirrhosis, etc.) since this agent will expand intravascular volume. </li>
    <li>Computed tomography (CT) scans require patient transportation and expose the patient to radiation. </li>
    <li>Insufficient bone window may represent a limitation of ultrasound-based monitoring in some patients. Another difficulty of sonography is that a reliable ultrasound examination usually requires a skilled and experienced examiner. </li>
    <li>The decision about whether or not to perform depressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) must also address its known complications, such as anesthetic risks, surgical risks (pain, infection, bleeding, and extra-axial fluid collections), the &quot;syndrome of the trephined&quot; (headache, seizures, and worsening of neurological deficit), higher rates of hydrocephalus, and the risks of cranioplasty (bleeding, infection). Since large hemispheric infarction (LHI) patients often have many medical co-morbidities, these risks can be substantial. Furthermore, the costs of DHC must be acknowledged, including the direct costs of the procedures and the prolonged hospitalization, as well as the costs of chronic care associated with functional dependency in a patient who might have otherwise died soon after their infarction. </li>
    <li>The concern of many clinicians has been that a reduction in mortality might be outweighed by a major disability in most survivors, leaving them severely disabled and facing a life of dependency, pain, and hopelessness. Therefore, the choice of performing DHC should hinge on the patient's willingness to accept survival with some degree of disability. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should avoid unnecessary or excessive analgesia and sedation, as this might lead to hypotension, immunosuppression, thromboembolic events, prolonged coma and ventilation, and other agent-specific side effects. </li>

    <li>The International Consensus Conference on Critical Care Management of Patients Following Large Hemispheric Infarct (LHI) was designed to help develop recommendations for treating LHI patients. One significant challenge the reviewers faced was the paucity of large clinical trials addressing important clinical management questions. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system allowed the panels to make recommendations not based only on the quality of the evidence but to also incorporate the factors such as risk benefit ratio, patient values and preferences, and resource consideration. </li>
    <li>It was clear that additional research is needed across the continuum of LHI patient care. Unfortunately, this type of clinical research could be difficult to execute given the complexity and variability of these patients. In the meantime, these guidelines can be used as a road map in treating patients with LHI. It should be noted that all guidelines need to be considered in the context of regional needs and resources, particularly when it comes to weak recommendations. The panel encourages guideline users to consider the nuances of the evidence presented as they implement these recommendations in their own practice. As the evidence grows, these recommendations will need to be reviewed accordingly. </li>
