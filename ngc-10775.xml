	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Note from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)</strong>: The following is a summary of the recommendations in the AAOS' clinical practice guideline on the Treatment of Pediatric Diaphyseal Femur Fractures. This summary does not contain rationales that explain how and why these recommendations were developed nor does it contain the evidence supporting these recommendations. All readers of this summary are strongly urged to consult the full guideline and evidence report for this information. The authors are confident that those who read the full guideline and evidence report will also see that the recommendations were developed using systematic evidence-based processes designed to combat bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. This summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Child Abuse</strong></p>
<p>Strong evidence supports that children younger than thirty-six months with a diaphyseal femur fracture be evaluated for child abuse. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong ****</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infant Femur Fracture</strong></p>
<p>Limited evidence supports treatment with a Pavlik harness or a spica cast for infants six months and younger with a diaphyseal femur fracture, because their outcomes are similar. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Limited **</strong></p>
<p><strong>Early or Delayed Spica Casting</strong></p>
<p>Moderate evidence supports early spica casting or traction with delayed spica casting for children age six months to five years with a diaphyseal femur fracture with less than 2cm of shortening. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Moderate ***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elastic Intramedullary Nails</strong></p>
<p>Limited evidence supports the option for physicians to use flexible intramedullary nailing to treat children age five to eleven years diagnosed with diaphyseal femur fractures. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Limited **</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) Pediatric Femur Fractures</strong></p>
<p>Limited evidence supports rigid trochanteric entry nailing, submuscular plating, and flexible intramedullary nailing as treatment options for children age eleven years to skeletal maturity diagnosed with diaphyseal femur fractures, but piriformis or near piriformis entry rigid nailing are not treatment options. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Limited **</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain Control</strong></p>
<p>Limited evidence supports regional pain management for patient comfort perioperatively. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Limited **</strong></p>
<p><strong>Waterproof Casting</strong></p>
<p>Limited evidence supports waterproof cast liners for spica casts are an option for use in children diagnosed with pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Limited **</strong></p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2015 Guideline Reissue</span></strong></p>
<p>The original guideline and systematic review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) were prepared by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Pediatric Diaphyseal Femur Fractures physician work group with the assistance of the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit. Based on the current procedure for updating AAOS guidelines, the Medical Librarian ran an updated search to identify literature published after the original search for the 2009 guideline that could address and possibly change the original recommendations. The AAOS Evidence Based Medicine Unit then used the inclusion criteria from the original guideline to determine if any articles published after the final literature search date of the original guideline were relevant to the recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection Criteria: Types of Studies</span></strong></p>
<p><em>A priori</em> article selection criteria were developed for the review. Specifically, to be included in the systematic reviews an article had to be a report of a study that:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Evaluated a treatment for isolated pediatric diaphyseal femur fracture </li>
    <li>Was a full article published in the peer reviewed literature </li>
    <li>Was an English language article published after 1965 </li>
    <li>Was not a cadaveric, animal, or <em>in vitro</em> study </li>
    <li>Was not a retrospective case series, medical records review, meeting abstract, unpublished study report, case report, historical article, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Was the most recent report of a study or the report with the largest number of enrolled patients in a study with multiple publications </li>
    <li>Enrolled &amp;ge;10 patients in each of its study groups </li>
    <li>Enrolled a patient population of at least 80% of patients with a diaphyseal femur fracture and were not skeletally mature (closure of proximal and distal femoral growth plates) </li>
    <li>Reported quantified results </li>
    <li>Enrolled patients without the following conditions
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Subtrochanteric fractures, supracondylar femur fractures, physeal fractures, open fractures, compound fractures, pathologic fractures, or multiple lower extremity fractures </li>
        <li>Co-existing abdominal or neurological injuries requiring surgical intervention (the physician work group chair and co-chair determined whether an article met inclusion criteria in cases when studies reported insufficient detail to determine whether co-existing injuries required surgical intervention) </li>
        <li>Osteogenesis imperfecta, cerebral palsy, myelodysplasia (spina bifida), metabolic bone diseases, or skeletal dysplasia </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When examining primary studies, the guideline work group analyzed the best available evidence regardless of study design. The work group first considered the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified by the search strategy. In the absence of two or more RCTs, they sequentially searched for prospective controlled trials, prospective comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, and prospective case-series studies. Only studies of the highest level of available evidence were included, assuming that there were 2 or more studies of that higher level. For example, if there were two high quality studies that addressed the recommendation, moderate, low, and very low quality studies were not included.</p>
<p>For the recommendation on waterproof cast liners only, the work group considered for inclusion studies that included patients with conditions other than diaphyseal femur fractures because the complications potentially avoided by using waterproof liners are not specific to diaphyseal femur fractures.</p>
<p>The Pediatric Diaphyseal Femur Fracture physician work group requested that the AAOS guidelines unit capture surrogate outcome measures if the study inclusion criteria were met. For this patient population, children, surrogate outcomes are often used because patients' communication skills are limited or not yet developed. Surrogate outcome measures are laboratory measurements or another physical sign that are used as substitutes for clinically meaningful end points that measure directly how a patient feels, functions, or survives. In order for a surrogate measure to be valid, it must be in the causal pathway between the intervention and the outcome and it must demonstrate a large, consistently measurable association with the outcome.</p>
<p>The main surrogate measures considered were radiographic measures, such as those indicating a malunion of the fracture. It should be noted that generally accepted definitions of malunion have not necessarily been correlated to function and risk of developing further problems.</p>
<p>An outcome was considered only if &amp;ge;50% (80% for case series) of the patients were followed for that outcome (for example, some studies reported short-term outcomes data on nearly all enrolled patients, and reported longer-term data on only a few patients. In such cases, the work group did not include the longer-term data). Outcomes were also excluded for study groups that did not have at least 10 patients.</p>
<p>When distinguishing between stable and unstable fractures, the work group defined transverse and short oblique fractures as stable. Comminuted and long oblique fractures were defined as unstable.</p>
<p>When the age range of patients in a study overlapped the target age range of two or more recommendations, the study was included in the evidence base of the recommendation whose age range included the study's median patient age.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Original and Updated Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The updated guideline searched for articles published up to November 27, 2013. The original guideline searched for articles published up to October 1, 2008. Search strategies were reviewed by the original work group prior to conducting the searches. All literature searches were supplemented with manual screening of bibliographies of all publications retrieved. The bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles were also searched for potentially relevant citations. A list of potentially relevant studies, not identified by the literature search, was also provided by the work group members. Three such studies met the inclusion criteria. One recommendation-specific search for primary articles on waterproof cast liners was conducted. For the entire guideline, thirty-two primary studies were included and two hundred forty-three studies were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Search for RCTs and Other Study Designs</strong></p>
<p>To identify primary studies for this guideline, the work group searched four electronic databases; PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategies used are provided in Appendix II in the 2015 guideline reissue. The work group used a previously published search strategy to identify relevant RCTs. In the absence of relevant RCTs, the work group modified the search strategy to identify studies of other designs. The study attrition diagram in Appendix I in the 2015 guideline reissue provides details about the inclusion and exclusion of these studies.</p></div>"/>

<p>Data elements extracted from studies were defined in consultation with the physician work group. Three reviewers completed data extraction independently for all studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus and by consulting the work group. Evidence tables were constructed to summarize the best evidence pertaining to each preliminary recommendation. The elements extracted are shown in Appendix IV in the 2015 guideline reissue.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Statistical Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The group calculated, where applicable, odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data.</p>
<p>When published studies only reported the median, range and size of the trial, the work group estimated their means and variances according to a published method.</p>
<p>The work group used StatXact for the calculation of exact odds ratios confidence intervals for dichotomous data. All other calculations were performed using STATA 10.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The Wilson score method was used to calculate confidence intervals for proportions. For ordinal data, the work group used ordinal logistic regression to calculate odds ratios. Ordinal logistic regression produces proportional odds ratios, which assumes that the odds ratio is the same between each pair of outcome groups (lowest category vs. all higher categories, lowest two categories vs. all higher categories, etc.).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>To develop the original 2009 guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the work group initially met in an introductory meeting on April 5, 2008, to establish the scope of the guideline and systematic review. Upon completion of the systematic review the work group participated in a two-day recommendation meeting on November 8 and 9, 2008, at which the final recommendations were written and voted on. The resulting draft guidelines were then peer-reviewed, subsequently sent for public commentary, and then sequentially approved by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Evidence Based Practice Committee, AAOS Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, AAOS Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology, and the AAOS Board of Directors.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Preliminary Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The original work group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of preliminary recommendations. These recommendations specify (what) should be done in (whom), (when), (where), and (how often or how long). They function as questions for the systematic review, not as final recommendations or conclusions. Simulated recommendations are almost always modified on the basis of the results of the systematic review. These recommendations also form the guideline's scope and guide the searches for literature. These <em>a priori </em>simulated recommendations are inviolate in that, once specified, they cannot be modified, they must all be addressed by the systematic review, and the relevant review results must be presented in the final guideline. The<em> a priori</em> and inviolate nature of the preliminary recommendations combats bias.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Following data extraction and analyses, each guideline recommendation was assigned a preliminary grade that was based on the total body of evidence available using the system shown in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field. </p>
<p>Each recommendation was constructed using the following language which took into account the final grade of recommendation:</p>

    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline was developed by an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) physician volunteer Work Group based on a systematic review of the current scientific and clinical information and accepted approaches to treatment and/or diagnosis. This Clinical Practice Guideline is not intended to be a fixed protocol, as some patients may require more or less treatment or different means of diagnosis. Clinical patients may not necessarily be the same as those found in a clinical trial. Patient care and treatment should always be based on a clinician's independent medical judgment, given the individual patient's clinical circumstances. </li>
    <li>Some drugs or medical devices referenced or described in this Clinical Practice Guideline may not have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or may have been cleared for a specific use only. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA clearance status of each drug or device he or she wishes to use in clinical practice. </li>
    <li>The age groups referred to in the specific recommendations are general guides. Obviously, additional factors may affect the physician's choice of treatment including but not limited to associated injuries the patient may present with as well as the individual's comorbidities, skeletal maturity, and/or specific patient characteristics including obesity. The individual patient's family dynamic will also influence treatment decisions; therefore, treatment decisions made for children who border any age group should be made on the basis of the individual. Decisions will always need to be predicated on guardian and physician communication with discussion of available treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient. Once the patient's guardian has been informed of available therapies and has discussed these options with his/her child's physician, an informed decision can be made. Clinician input based on experience increases the probability of identifying patients who will benefit from specific treatment options. </li>
