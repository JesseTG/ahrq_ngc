	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li><strong>Preoperative Evaluation</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Anesthesiologists should work with surgeons to develop a protocol whereby patients in whom the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is suspected on clinical grounds are evaluated long enough before the day of surgery to allow preparation of a perioperative management plan.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>This evaluation may be initiated in a preanesthesia clinic (if available) or by direct consultation from the operating surgeon to the anesthesiologist. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A preoperative evaluation should include a comprehensive review of previous medical records (if available), an interview with the patient and/or family, and conducting a physical examination.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Medical records review should include (but not be limited to) checking for a history of airway difficulty with previous anesthetics, hypertension, or other cardiovascular problems, and other congenital or acquired medical conditions. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Review of sleep studies is encouraged.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>The patient and family interview should include focused questions related to snoring, apneic episodes, frequent arousals during sleep (e.g., vocalization, shifting position, and extremity movements), morning headaches, and daytime somnolence.* </li>
            <li>A physical examination should include an evaluation of the airway, nasopharyngeal characteristics, neck circumference, tonsil size, and tongue volume. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If any characteristics noted during the preoperative evaluation suggest that the patient has OSA, the anesthesiologist and surgeon should jointly decide whether to (1) manage the patient perioperatively based on clinical criteria alone or (2) obtain sleep studies, conduct a more extensive airway examination, and initiate indicated OSA treatment in advance of surgery. </li>
        <li>If the preoperative evaluation does not occur until the day of surgery, the surgeon and anesthesiologist together may elect for presumptive management based on clinical criteria or a last-minute delay of surgery. </li>
        <li>For safety, clinical criteria should be designed to have a high degree of sensitivity (despite the resulting low specificity), meaning that some patients may be treated more aggressively than would be necessary if a sleep study was available. </li>
        <li>The severity of the patient's OSA, the invasiveness of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, and the requirement for postoperative analgesics should be taken into account in determining whether a patient is at increased perioperative risk from OSA. </li>
        <li>The patient and his or her family as well as the surgeon should be informed of the potential implications of OSA on the patient's perioperative course. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li><strong>Inpatient Versus Outpatient Surgery</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Before patients at increased perioperative risk from OSA are scheduled to undergo surgery, a determination should be made regarding whether a surgical procedure is most appropriately performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Factors to be considered in determining whether outpatient care is appropriate include (1) sleep apnea status, (2) anatomical and physiologic abnormalities, (3) status of coexisting diseases, (4) nature of surgery, (5) type of anesthesia, (6) need for postoperative opioids, (7) patient age, (8) adequacy of postdischarge observation, and (9) capabilities of the outpatient facility. </li>
            <li>The availability of emergency difficult airway equipment, respiratory care equipment, radiology facilities, clinical laboratory facilities, and a transfer agreement with an inpatient facility should be considered in making this determination. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li><strong>Preoperative Preparation</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Preoperative initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be considered, particularly if OSA is severe.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>For patients who do not respond adequately to CPAP, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be considered. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The preoperative use of mandibular advancement devices or oral appliances and preoperative weight loss should be considered when feasible.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>A patient who has had corrective airway surgery (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, surgical mandibular advancement) should be assumed to remain at risk of OSA complications unless a normal sleep study has been obtained and symptoms have not returned. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Patients with known or suspected OSA may have difficult airways and therefore should be managed according to the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summary of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=43897&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #9689&quot;>Practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway: an updated report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway</a>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li><strong>Intraoperative Management</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Because of their propensity for airway collapse and sleep deprivation, patients at increased perioperative risk from OSA are especially susceptible to the respiratory depressant and airway effects of sedatives, opioids, and inhaled anesthetics; therefore, the potential for postoperative respiratory compromise should be considered in selecting intraoperative medications. </li>
        <li>For superficial procedures, consider the use of local anesthesia or peripheral nerve blocks, with or without moderate sedation. </li>
        <li>If moderate sedation is used, ventilation should be continuously monitored by capnography or another automated method if feasible because of the increased risk of undetected airway obstruction in these patients. </li>
        <li>Consider administering CPAP or using an oral appliance during sedation to patients previously treated with these modalities. </li>
        <li>General anesthesia with a secure airway is preferable to deep sedation without a secure airway, particularly for procedures that may mechanically compromise the airway. </li>
        <li>Major conduction anesthesia (spinal/epidural) should be considered for peripheral procedures. </li>
        <li>Unless there is a medical or surgical contraindication, patients at increased perioperative risk from OSA should be extubated while awake. </li>
        <li>Full reversal of neuromuscular block should be verified before extubation. </li>
        <li>When possible, extubation and recovery should be carried out in the lateral, semiupright, or other nonsupine position. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>

        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Because of their propensity to develop airway obstruction or central respiratory depression, this may require a longer stay as compared with non-OSA patients undergoing similar procedures. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To establish that patients are able to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels while breathing room air, respiratory function may be determined by observing patients in an unstimulated environment, preferably while asleep. </li>

<p>For these updated Guidelines, a review of studies used in the development of the original Guidelines was combined with studies published subsequent to approval of the original Guidelines in 2005.</p>
<p>Interventions were examined to assess their relationship to a variety of outcomes related to the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea in the following areas:</p>

<p>For the literature review, potentially relevant clinical studies were identified via electronic and manual searches of the literature. The electronic and manual searches covered a 61 year period from 1953 to 2013. More than 2,000 citations were initially identified, yielding a total of 835 non-overlapping articles that addressed topics related to the evidence linkages.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Scientific Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Findings from the aggregated literature are reported in the text of the guidelines by evidence category, level, and direction. Evidence categories refer specifically to the strength and quality of the <em>research design</em> of the studies. Category A evidence represents results obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and Category B evidence represents observational results obtained from nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent controls. When available, Category A evidence is given precedence over Category B evidence in the reporting of results. These evidence categories are further divided into evidence levels. Evidence levels refer specifically to the strength and quality of the summarized study <em>findings</em> (i.e., statistical findings, type of data, and the number of studies reporting/replicating the findings) within the two evidence categories. For this document, only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention, including a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocality for each outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>
<p>RCTs report comparative findings between clinical interventions for specified outcomes. Statistically significant (<em>P</em>&amp;lt;0.01) outcomes are designated as either beneficial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E).</p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis,&amp;dagger; and meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains multiple RCTs, but the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these guidelines. Findings from these RCTs are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains a single RCT, and findings from this study are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Category B</strong></p>
<p>Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups may permit <em>inference</em> of beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes. Inferred findings are given a directional designation of beneficial (B), harmful (H), or equivocal (E). For studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is <em>P</em> value less than 0.01.</p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains observational comparisons (e.g., cohort and case-control research designs) between clinical interventions for a specified outcome.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains observational studies with associative statistics (e.g., relative risk, correlation, and sensitivity/specificity).</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies and percentages).</p>
<p><em>Level 4</em>: The literature contains case reports.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The <em>lack</em> of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable (i.e., no pertinent studies found) or inadequate. Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes, because such literature does not permit a clear interpretation of findings due to methodological concerns (e.g., confounding in study design or implementation) or does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the &quot;Focus&quot; of the guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Opinion-Based Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>All opinion-based evidence (e.g., survey data, open-forum testimony, internet-based comments, letters, and editorials) relevant to each topic was considered in the development of these updated Guidelines. However, only the findings obtained from formal surveys are reported.</p>
<p>Opinion surveys were developed for this update by the Task Force to address each clinical intervention identified in the document. Identical surveys were distributed to expert consultants and a random sample of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) members.</p>
<p><strong>Category A: Expert Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Survey responses from Task Force-appointed expert consultants are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of consultant survey responses reported in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Category B: Membership Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Survey responses from active ASA members are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of ASA member survey responses reported in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Survey responses from expert and membership sources are recorded by using a 5-point scale and summarized based on median values.&amp;Dagger;</p>
<p><em>Strongly Agree</em>: Median score of 5 (at least 50% of the responses are 5)</p>
<p><em>Agree</em>: Median score of 4 (at least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5)</p>
<p><em>Equivocal</em>: Median score of 3 (at least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other response category or combination of similar categories contains at least 50% of the responses)</p>
<p><em>Disagree</em>: Median score of 2 (at least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2)</p>
<p><em>Strongly Disagree</em>: Median score of 1 (at least 50% of responses are 1)</p>
<p><strong>Category C: Informal Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Open-forum testimony obtained during development of the original guidelines, Internet-based comments, letters, and editorials are all informally evaluated and discussed during the formulation of guideline recommendations. When warranted, the Task Force may add educational information or cautionary notes based on this information.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger; All meta-analyses are conducted by the ASA methodology group. Meta-analyses from other sources are reviewed but not included as evidence in this document.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;Dagger; When an equal number of categorically distinct responses are obtained, the median value is determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. Ties are calculated by a predetermined formula.</p></div>"/>

<p>No evidence linkage contained sufficient literature with well-defined experimental designs and statistical information to conduct an analysis of aggregated randomized controlled trials (i.e., meta-analysis).</p>
<p>Interobserver agreement among Task Force members and two methodologists was established by inter-rater reliability testing. Agreement levels using a kappa (ĸ) statistic for two-rater agreement pairs were as follows: (1) type of study design, ĸ=0.50 to 0.69; (2) type of analysis, ĸ=0.43 to 0.60; (3) evidence linkage assignment, ĸ=0.88 to 1.00; and (4) literature inclusion for database, ĸ=0.44 to 0.87. The rater chance-corrected agreement values were (1) study design, Sav=0.56, Var (Sav)=0.009; (2) type of analysis, Sav=0.54, Var (Sav)=0.011; (3) linkage assignment, Sav=0.87, Var (Sav)=0.003; and (4) literature database inclusion, Sav=0.58, Var (Sav)=0.030. These values represent moderate to high levels of agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus-based Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Consensus was obtained from multiple sources, including (1) updated surveys sent to consultants who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and a random sample of American Society of Anesthesiologists members, (2) testimony from attendees of two publicly held open forums at two national anesthesia meetings, and (3) Task Force opinion and interpretation. An updated opinion survey of consultant and American Society of Anesthesiologists members regarding the management of patients with known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea was conducted. The survey rate of return for the consultants was 53% (N=54 of 102) and 267 responses were obtained from the random sample of American Society of Anesthesiologists members. Summary results of these surveys are reported in the text of these updated guidelines, with a complete and full reporting of all questionnaire item responses in Tables 3 and 4 in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The original guidelines were developed by an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)-appointed Task Force of 12 members, consisting of anesthesiologists in both private and academic practices from various geographic areas of the United States, a bariatric surgeon, an otolaryngologist, and two methodologists from the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters.</p>
<p>The original Task Force developed the guidelines by means of a six-step process. First, they reached consensus on the criteria for evidence of effective perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Second, original published research studies from peer-reviewed journals relevant to the perioperative management of patients with OSA were evaluated. Third, the panel of expert consultants was asked to (1) participate in opinion surveys on the effectiveness of various perioperative management strategies for patients with OSA and (2) review and comment on a draft of the guidelines developed by the Task Force. Fourth, the Task Force held open forums at two major national meetings to solicit input on its draft recommendations. National organizations representing most of the specialties whose members typically care for patients with OSA were invited to participate in the open forums. Fifth, the consultants were surveyed to assess their opinions on the feasibility and financial implications of implementing the Guidelines. Sixth, all available information was used to build consensus within the Task Force to finalize the guidelines.</p>
<p>In 2012, the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters requested that the updated guidelines published in 2006 be re-evaluated. This update consists of an evaluation of literature published since completion of the original guidelines and an evaluation of new survey findings of expert consultants and ASA members. A summary of recommendations is found in Appendix 1 in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>
