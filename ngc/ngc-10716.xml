	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Assessment and Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>When considering initiation of methadone, the panel recommends that clinicians perform an individualized medical and behavioral risk evaluation to assess risks and benefits of methadone, given methadone's specific pharmacologic properties and adverse effect profile (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Education and Counseling</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel recommends that clinicians educate and counsel patients prior to the first prescription of methadone about the indications for treatment and goals of therapy, availability of alternative therapies, and specific plans for monitoring therapy, adjusting doses, potential adverse effects associated with methadone, and methods for reducing the risk of potential adverse effects and managing them (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Baseline Electrocardiograms</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The panel recommends that clinicians <em>obtain</em> an electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiation of methadone in patients with risk factors for corrected electrocardiographic QT (QTc) interval prolongation, any prior ECG demonstrating a QTc &amp;gt;450 ms, or a history suggestive of prior ventricular arrhythmia. An ECG within the past 3 months with a QTc &amp;lt;450 ms in patients without new risk factors for QTc interval prolongation can be used for the baseline study (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The panel recommends that clinicians <em>consider</em> obtaining an ECG prior to initiation of methadone in patients not known to be at higher risk for QTc interval prolongation; an ECG within the past year with a QTc &amp;lt;450 ms in patients without new risk factors for QTc interval prolongation can be used for the baseline study (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The panel recommends against use of methadone in patients with a baseline QTc interval &amp;gt;500 ms (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The panel recommends that clinicians consider alternate opioids in patients with a baseline QTc interval &amp;ge;450 ms but &amp;lt;500 ms. If methadone is considered in a patient with a baseline QTc interval &amp;ge;450 ms but &amp;lt;500 ms, the clinician should evaluate for and correct reversible causes of QTc interval prolongation before initiating methadone (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The panel recommends that clinicians consider buprenorphine as a treatment option for patients treated for opioid addiction who have risk factors for or known QTc interval prolongation when an agonist/partial agonist is indicated (<strong>weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Initiation of Methadone</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel recommends that clinicians initiate methadone at low doses individualized based on the indication for treatment and prior opioid exposure status, titrate doses slowly, and monitor patients for sedation (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Practice Advice: Based on limited research evidence and clinical experience, the panel suggests the following parameters:</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>When used to treat opioid addiction, the panel suggests that clinicians start methadone at no more than 30 to 40 mg once daily. The dose should be titrated based on objective signs of withdrawal and self-reported craving and methadone dose increased by no more than 10 mg/d and no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days. Methadone should be withheld if there is evidence of sedation. </li>
    <li>When used to treat chronic pain in adults on relatively low doses of other opioids (e.g., &amp;lt;40 to 60 mg/d of morphine or equivalent), the panel suggests that clinicians start methadone at 2.5 mg three times a day (tid), with initial dose increases of no more than 5 mg/d every 5 to 7 days. In children, the recommended starting dose is 100 &amp;micro;g/kg (maximum 5 mg/dose) every 6 to 8 hours. Methadone should be withheld if there is evidence of sedation. </li>
    <li>When used to treat chronic pain and switching to methadone from higher doses of another opioid, the panel suggests that clinicians start methadone therapy at a dose 75% to 90% less than the calculated equianalgesic dose and at no higher than 30 to 40 mg/d, with initial dose increases of no more than 10 mg/d every 5 to 7 days. Methadone should be withheld if there is evidence of sedation. </li>
</ol>
<p>The panel recommends that clinicians consider those patients previously prescribed methadone, but who have not currently taken opioids for 1 to 2 weeks, opioid-na&amp;iuml;ve for the purpose of methadone reinitiation (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Follow-up Electrocardiograms</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The panel recommends that for patients prescribed methadone, clinicians perform follow-up ECGs based on baseline ECG findings, methadone dose changes, and other risk factors for QTc interval prolongation (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Practice Advice: Based on limited research evidence and based upon clinical experience, the panel suggests the following parameters:</em></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The panel suggests that for patients with risk factors for QTc interval prolongation, any prior ECG demonstrating a QTc &amp;gt;450 ms, or a history of syncope, clinicians perform follow-up ECG 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of methadone therapy and following significant dose increases. </li>
        <li>The panel suggests that for all patients, clinicians perform follow-up ECG when the methadone dose reaches 30 to 40 mg/d in patients started at lower doses, and again at 100 mg/d. </li>
        <li>The panel suggests that clinicians perform follow-up ECG for all patients prescribed methadone with new risk factors for QTc interval prolongation or signs or symptoms suggesting arrhythmia. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The panel recommends that clinicians switch methadone-treated adults with a QTc interval &amp;ge;500 ms to an alternative opioid or immediately reduce the methadone dose; in all such cases, the panel recommends that clinicians evaluate and correct reversible causes of QTc interval prolongation, and repeat the ECG after the methadone dose has been decreased (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The panel recommends that clinicians consider switching methadone-treated adults with a QTc interval &amp;ge;450 ms but &amp;lt;500 ms to an alternative opioid or reducing the methadone dose. In patients in whom there are barriers to switching to alternative opioids, or who experience decreased treatment effectiveness with methadone dose reductions, the panel recommends that clinicians discuss with patients the potential risks of continued methadone. In all cases, the panel recommends that clinicians evaluate and correct reversible causes of QTc interval prolongation, and repeat the ECG after the methadone dose has been decreased (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Monitoring for and Management of Adverse Events</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The panel recommends that patients receiving methadone be monitored for common opioid adverse effects and toxicities and that adverse effects management be considered part of routine therapy (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The panel recommends face-to-face or phone assessment with patients to assess for adverse events within 3 to 5 days after initiating methadone, and within 3 to 5 days after each dose increase (<strong>strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Urine Drug Testing</span></strong></p>

<p>With the Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center, the panel developed the key questions, scope, and inclusion criteria used to guide the evidence review.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Search and Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center staff searched the Cochrane Library, Ovid&amp;reg; MEDLINE, and PsycINFO through July 2012 for studies assessing harms associated with methadone use (detailed search strategies are shown in Appendix C of the systematic review). An update search was performed in January 2014 for new studies on methadone-related overdose and arrhythmia. Reviews of reference lists supplemented the electronic searches.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>All identified citations were imported into an electronic database (EndNote&amp;reg; X1) and reviewed for inclusion. One investigator reviewed potential citations for inclusion and a second investigator checked excluded citations to identify potentially relevant citations not selected by the first reviewer. Review staff included studies that met all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Evaluated children or adults prescribed oral or intravenous methadone or infants whose mothers were methadone users </li>
    <li>Were relevant to a key question </li>
    <li>Reported harms associated with methadone use </li>
    <li>For all key questions and harms: Were systematic reviews, randomized or quasi-randomized trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, or case-control studies </li>
    <li>For mortality, overdose, cardiac events, electrocardiographic changes, and pregnancy-related harms, as well as for key questions that addressed risk factors for methadone-associated harms: review staff also included prevalence studies, before-after studies, and case series. </li>
</ul>
<p>Studies only published as conference abstracts were excluded. Non-English language studies were excluded. Other reviews, policy statements, and articles without original data were obtained for background and contextual information, but were not included as evidence.</p></div>"/>

The most common reasons for study exclusion were: wrong outcomes (did not address included harms); wrong study design (pharmacokinetics, case reports, pharmacodynamics); and wrong publication type (editorial, opinion, letters, guidelines, narrative, or non-systematic review).</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction and Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Randomized Trials</strong></p>
<p>For randomized trials, the reviewers abstracted the following information:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Inclusion and exclusion criteria </li>
    <li>Number of patients enrolled </li>
    <li>Demographics and baseline characteristics </li>
    <li>Setting </li>
    <li>Funding source </li>
    <li>Interventions evaluated </li>
    <li>Duration of follow-up </li>
    <li>Loss to follow-up </li>
    <li>Compliance to treatment </li>
    <li>Adverse events </li>
</ul>
<p>The internal validity (quality) of randomized clinical trials was assessed using 11 predefined criteria developed by the Cochrane Back Review Group (see Appendix D of the systematic review for details on how reviewers operationalized the criteria). The reviewers rated the internal validity of each trial based on the methods used for randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding; the similarity of compared groups at baseline; the use of co-interventions; compliance to allocated therapy; adequate reporting of dropouts and loss to follow-up; degree of loss to follow-up; non-differential timing of outcome assessment; and the use of intention-to-treat analysis.</p>
<p>An overall quality grade was assigned based on the type, number and seriousness of methodological flaws. The reviewers graded trials with no or only minor flaws good-quality, those with serious flaws poor-quality, and all others fair-quality, as described in further detail below.</p>
<p>Studies rated &quot;good&quot; have the least risk of bias and results are considered valid. Good-quality studies include clear descriptions of the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; a valid method for allocation of patients to treatment; low dropout rates, and clear reporting of dropouts; appropriate means for preventing bias; appropriate measurement of outcomes, and reporting results.</p>
<p>Studies rated &quot;fair&quot; are susceptible to some bias, but it is not sufficient to invalidate the results. These studies do not meet all the criteria for a rating of good-quality because they have some deficiencies, but no flaw is likely to cause major bias. The study may be missing information, making it difficult to assess limitations and potential problems. The &quot;fair&quot; quality category is broad, and studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses: the results of some fair-quality studies are likely to be valid, while others are only probably valid.</p>
<p>Studies rated &quot;poor&quot; have significant flaws that imply biases of various types that may invalidate the results. They have a serious or &quot;fatal&quot; flaw in design, analysis, or reporting; large amounts of missing information; or discrepancies in reporting. The results of these studies are at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as the true difference between the compared medications. Reviewers did not exclude studies rated poor-quality a priori, but poor-quality studies were considered to be less reliable than higher quality studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies between studies were present.</p>
<p><strong>Observational Studies</strong></p>
<p>For observational studies, the reviewers abstracted the following information:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Study design (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, before-after, case series, prevalence, or other) </li>
    <li>Inclusion and exclusion criteria </li>
    <li>Number of patients eligible and included </li>
    <li>Demographics and baseline characteristics </li>
    <li>Country and setting </li>
    <li>Funding source </li>
    <li>Interventions evaluated </li>
    <li>Duration of follow-up (for studies using a longitudinal design) </li>
    <li>Loss to follow-up (for studies using a longitudinal design) or proportion of patients meeting inclusion criteria who were analyzed </li>
    <li>Adverse events </li>
</ul>
<p>The internal validity (quality) of observational studies was assessed using predefined criteria based on those developed by Downs and Black and the US Preventive Services Task Force (see Appendix D in the systematic review). The internal validity of each study was rated based on the methods used to select patients for inclusion (ideally, enrollment of consecutive or a random sample patients meeting inclusion criteria, with matching if appropriate for the study design); similarity of compared groups at baseline (for comparative studies); accuracy of methods for ascertaining exposures, confounders, and outcomes; blinding of outcomes assessors; adequate reporting of drop-outs (for longitudinal studies) or the proportion of patients meeting inclusion criteria who were analyzed (for non-longitudinal studies); degree of loss to follow-up or proportion meeting inclusion criteria who were analyzed; and statistical analyses on potential confounders. As with randomized trials, an overall quality grade was assigned based on the type, number and seriousness of methodological flaws (see above). Reviewers graded studies with no or only minor flaws good-quality, those with serious flaws poor-quality, and all others fair-quality.</p>
<p>In general, a good-quality observational study is considered less reliable than a good-quality randomized trial. Among the observational studies, evidence hierarchies typically place a good-cohort study at the top, followed by case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, before-after studies, and other uncontrolled studies (e.g., case series and prevalence studies).</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included recent, higher-quality systematic reviews on mortality risk associated with use of methadone. Systematic reviews were defined as studies that at a minimum described systematic methods for identifying and selecting studies and synthesizing evidence. For each systematic review, reviewers abstracted the following information:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Databases searched </li>
    <li>Dates of the searches </li>
    <li>Language restrictions, if any </li>
    <li>Number of studies included </li>
    <li>Criteria used to include studies </li>
    <li>Limitations of the included studies </li>
    <li>Methods for rating the quality of included studies </li>
    <li>Methods for synthesizing the evidence </li>
    <li>Interventions evaluated </li>
    <li>Number of treatment and control subjects </li>
    <li>Adverse event outcomes (including number and quality of studies for each comparison and outcome, and pooled results if available) </li>
</ul>
<p>The reliability of systematic reviews depends on how well they are conducted. Predefined criteria adapted from the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool were used to assess the internal validity of systematic reviews (see Appendix D in the systematic review). Each study was evaluated on the following criteria: comprehensiveness of search strategy, application of pre-defined inclusion criteria to select studies, dual selection of studies, dual extraction of data, adequate explanation of included studies, appropriate assessment of validity and use of appropriate methods to synthesize the evidence. Reviewers assigned an overall quality grade based on the type, number and seriousness of methodological flaws. Systematic reviews with major flaws are more likely to produce positive conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions. Reviewers graded systematic reviews with no or only minor flaws good-quality, those with serious flaws poor-quality, and all others fair-quality.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Pain Society (APS) and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) convened a panel of 16 members with expertise in pain, addiction medicine, cardiology, primary care, nursing, palliative care, pharmacology, adolescent medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, epidemiology, and social work to review the evidence and formulate recommendations on methadone safety. Two cochairs were selected by the APS and CPDD to lead the panel, which also included the APS Director of Clinical Guidelines Development. The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) was invited to join the guideline development process after cochair and initial panel selection had taken place, and it appointed 2 members with expertise in arrhythmia to the panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guideline panel met in person in May 2010 and July 2011. At the first meeting, the panel developed the scope and key questions used to guide the systematic evidence review. At the second meeting, the panel reviewed the results of the evidence review and drafted initial potential recommendation statements. Following the second meeting, additional draft recommendation statements were proposed. The panelists then participated in a multistage Delphi process, in which each draft recommendation was ranked on clinical importance and usefulness, and revised. At each stage of the Delphi process, the lowest-ranked recommendations were eliminated. A two-thirds majority was required for a recommendation to be approved. However, unanimous or near-unanimous consensus was achieved for all recommendations. After finalization of the recommendations, the Guideline was written by various panel members and drafts distributed to the panel for feedback and revisions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Grading of the Evidence and Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel used methods adapted from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group to rate the recommendations included in this Guideline. Each recommendation received a separate grade for the strength of the recommendation (strong or weak) and for the quality of evidence (high, moderate, or low) (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). In general, a strong recommendation is based on the panel's assessment that the potential benefits of following the recommendation clearly outweigh potential harms and burdens, or that the potential harms clearly outweigh potential benefits. Given the available evidence, most clinicians and patients would choose to follow a strong recommendation. A weak recommendation is based on the panel's assessment that benefits of following the recommendation outweigh potential harms and burdens (or vice versa), but the balance of benefits to harms or burdens is smaller or evidence is weaker. Decisions to follow a weak recommendation could vary depending on specific clinical circumstances or patient preferences and values. For grading the quality of a body of evidence that supports a recommendation, the panel considered the type, number, size, and quality of studies; strength of associations or effects; and consistency of results among studies. The quality of evidence indicates the level of certainty in the recommendation and the likelihood that future research could change recommendations. A recommendation based on low-quality evidence has a high probability of being affected by new evidence, and a recommendation based on high-quality evidence has a low probability. Strong recommendations based on low-quality evidence indicate that until better evidence becomes available, the panel determined that the benefits of following the recommended course of action clearly outweigh harms. In some cases, recommendations based on low-quality evidence are followed by &quot;practice advice&quot; with more specific suggestions for implementing the recommendation in clinical practice, based on panel consensus.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The pharmacology of methadone may be associated with unique safety concerns. This pharmacology includes a long and variable half-life, potential interactions with multiple medications, variability in equianalgesic dose ratios depending on dose, and association with prolongation of the corrected electrocardiographic QT (QTc) interval, which may predispose patients to the ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes. </li>
    <li>Safe use of methadone requires clinical skills and knowledge in use of methadone to mitigate potential risks, including serious risks related to risk of overdose and cardiac arrhythmias. </li>
    <li>In addition to QTc interval prolongation, methadone is associated with other adverse effects typically associated with opioids, including constipation, nausea, sedation, respiratory depression, pruritus, endocrinologic effects, and others. </li>
    <li>Patients treated for opioid addiction are at high risk for opioid abuse and misuse and generally warrant frequent monitoring. Patients prescribed methadone for chronic pain who may need more frequent or intense monitoring include those with a prior history of substance use disorder, patients with an unstable or dysfunctional social environment, and those with comorbid psychiatric conditions. </li>
    <li>Neonatal abstinence syndrome occurs in three quarters or more of infants exposed to methadone prenatally. </li>
