	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the overall quality of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low, or insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong, weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 L of urine per day to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Low-quality evidence showed that increased fluid intake is associated with a reduction in stone recurrence. Evidence also did not show any difference between tap water and a specific brand of mineral water (Fiuggi brand oligomineral water). People who already drink recommended amounts of liquids and those in whom increased fluid intake is contraindicated should not be directed to increase their fluid intake further. Although some low-quality evidence shows that a decrease in the consumption of soft drinks is associated with a reduced risk for stone recurrence, this benefit was limited to patients who drank soft drinks acidified by phosphoric acid, such as colas, but not for drinks acidified by citric acid, such as fruit-flavored sodas.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: ACP recommends pharmacologic monotherapy with a thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in patients with active disease in which increased fluid intake fails to reduce the formation of stones. (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Moderate-quality evidence showed that thiazide diuretics, citrates, and allopurinol reduce the risk for recurrence of composite calcium stones. Combination therapy with these agents was not more beneficial than monotherapy. Although biochemistry and some observational data on stone recurrence suggest that the choice of treatment could be based on the type of metabolic abnormality, evidence from randomized, controlled trials is lacking to correlate the drug of choice and stone type to the prevention of stone recurrence. Most patients have calcium stones, and evidence showed that thiazide diuretics, citrates, and allopurinol all effectively reduced recurrence of this stone type. Note that the available evidence evaluated higher doses of thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg; chlorthalidone, 25 or 50 mg; indapamide, 2.5 mg) to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis. The use of lower doses of thiazides is associated with fewer adverse effects, but their effectiveness in preventing stone recurrence compared with higher doses is not known. All of the medications are associated with adverse events, which are summarized in Table 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The literature search included English-language trials identified by using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (January 1948 to September 2012), Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science. The literature search was updated in March 2014, and no additional studies met the inclusion or exclusion criteria. Dietary interventions that were evaluated included intake of fluids, calcium, animal protein, sodium, fruit and fiber, purine, oxalate, potassium, soft drinks, citrus, or multicomponent diets. We also included empirical dietary interventions and those tailored according to patient demographics, comorbid conditions, baseline diet, baseline urine or blood biochemical testing, and/or stone type. Pharmacologic agents evaluated include medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and available in the United States for prescription (for example, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, indapamide, potassium citrate, potassium&amp;ndash;magnesium citrate, sodium citrate, allopurinol, magnesium hydroxide, or acetohydroxamic acid [AHA]). For key questions 1, 2, 4, and 6, we considered final clinical health outcomes as the most important measures of treatment benefit, including symptomatic stone recurrence, pain, urinary tract obstruction with acute renal failure, infection, morbidity related to treatment of a recurrent stone, emergency department visits or hospitalizations for treatment of recurrent stones (for example, for renal colic or acute renal failure), quality of life (general or urologic), and end-stage renal disease. The next most important measures of treatment considered for key questions 1, 2, 4, and 6 were intermediate stone outcomes, including composite recurrence (combination of symptomatic or radiographically detected recurrence), recurrence detected only by scheduled radiographic imaging, and change in stone size. Evidence suggests that stones identified with imaging are associated with symptomatic recurrence. For key questions 3 and 5, adverse effects included any reported by eligible trials (for example, nausea, diarrhea, hypokalemia, weight change, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia).Measures of treatment adherence were those reported by the individual trials (for example, self-report questionnaire, pill count, or as estimated by follow-up urine biochemical measures).

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as &quot;insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks.&quot; Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>For each article, 1 reviewer extracted details on study design, participant characteristics, outcomes, and adverse events, and a second reviewer checked accuracy. Using criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, 2 reviewers rated individual study quality as good, fair, or poor on the basis of adequacy of allocation concealment, blinding, reporting reasons for attrition, and how analyses accounted for incomplete data (Appendix Table 3 in the systematic evidence review). Following methods developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Effective Health Care Program, 2 reviewers graded the strength of evidence (SOE) for the efficacy of each treatment comparison in preventing stone recurrence on the basis of risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision (see Appendix Tables 4 to 6 in the systematic evidence review). Discrepancies in quality ratings and SOE grades were resolved by discussion and consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers pooled results if clinical heterogeneity of patient populations, interventions, and outcomes was minimal. Data were analyzed in Review Manager, version 5.1 (The Nordic Cochrane Center, Copenhagen, Denmark). Random-effects models were used to generate pooled estimates of relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals&amp;nbsp;(CIs), and statistical heterogeneity was summarized using the <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic. When there were few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for a given treatment and no overlap of reported outcomes, reviewers synthesized data qualitatively. For analyses of pharmacologic treatments, reviewers evaluated results by drug class and individual agent. Where data allowed, treatment efficacy was explored according to patient characteristics, stone characteristics, baseline and follow-up biochemical measures, and study duration.</p></div>"/>
