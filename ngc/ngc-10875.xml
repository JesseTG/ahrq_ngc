	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

</table>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*The overall strength of the evidence is based on the certainty of the magnitude of benefit defined as benefit minus harm.</p>
<p><em>Certainty of Net Benefit</em></p>
<p><strong>High</strong> = The available evidence includes consistent results from well designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> = The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the therapy on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings; or a lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> = The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of a limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency of findings across individual studies, gaps in the chain of evidence; findings not generalizable, or lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = The committee strongly recommends that clinicians routinely provide this therapy. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = The committee recommends that clinicians routinely provide this therapy. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = The committee recommends that clinicians consider providing this therapy to selected patients depending on individual circumstances. However, for most individuals without signs or symptoms, there is likely to be only a small benefit from this therapy.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> = The committee recommends against the therapy. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should discourage the use of this therapy.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> = The committee concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the therapy. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p></div>"/>

Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were conducted and completed in May 2012 and updated in August 2013. All relevant articles were included, and the search was not limited by date. The searches combined controlled vocabulary terms and text words for cystic fibrosis (CF) and terms relevant for each question to create comprehensive search strategies (see the online supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Reference lists of relevant Cochrane reviews were also scanned, and references of eligible articles were examined. All identified citations were imported into a database maintained in reference management software (ProCite; ThomsonReuters, New York, NY). A custom workform was used to track the search results. Citations were uploaded into a Web-based system (DistillerSR; Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada) to complete and track the screening process. Two reviewers independently screened citations for eligibility, first using title and abstract. Citations determined to be potentially eligible were subsequently screened using the full text or full article. Predefined eligibility criteria were applied during the screening process. However, additional criteria were added for the full-text screen based on feedback from the chairs of the committee to remove studies of individuals with chronic <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (<em>P. aeruginosa</em>) infection. Specifically, studies with a population defined by authors as chronically infected with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> or articles stating that subjects had two or more positive <em>P. aeruginosa</em> cultures in previous 12 months were excluded from consideration. Disagreements concerning eligibility were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer.</p>
<p>The search identified 3,547 unique citations, of which 18 citations describing 13 studies were eligible for inclusion (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The reviewers identified seven treatment trials of initial or newly acquired <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection that ranged in size from 21 to 304 individuals with CF. Only three of the seven trials concealed allocation of study subjects to the intervention and used blinded or masked outcome assessment. Two trials compared inhaled tobramycin with placebo. One trial compared inhaled colistin and oral ciprofloxacin with no therapy. Four studies compared a variety of combinations of oral ciprofloxacin, inhaled colistin, and inhaled tobramycin for treatment of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection. Two studies evaluated antibiotic or vaccine prophylaxis to prevent infection. Four studies evaluated the accuracy of oropharyngeal (OP) cultures compared with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cultures for the identifying <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection.</p></div>"/>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*The overall strength of the evidence is based on the certainty of the magnitude of benefit defined as benefit minus harm.</p>
<p><strong>Certainty of Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong> = The available evidence includes consistent results from well designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> = The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the therapy on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings; or a lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> = The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of a limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency of findings across individual studies, gaps in the chain of evidence; findings not generalizable, or lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>An 18-member multidisciplinary committee developed a series of questions about the effectiveness of prevention and eradication strategies for <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (<em>P. aeruginosa</em>) infection and the use of bronchoscopy to obtain routine airway cultures. The outcome of interest was cultures without growth of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. The key questions were as follows. (1) What is the best eradication therapy for a newly acquired <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection? (2) Can prophylactic antibiotic therapy prevent <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection? (3) What is the role of bronchoscopy in obtaining routine airway cultures?</p>
<p>The committee met in October 2012 and October 2013 to review the evidence and to make recommendations. Committee members disclosed any potential conﬂicts of interest in writing to the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation. One member, having previously served on an advisory board, was recused from discussion of inhaled aztreonam. Three committee members served as principal investigators for studies reviewed by the committee. These individuals recused themselves from discussion of these studies, but they did participate in the formulation of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The evidence was reviewed by the committee, and the final recommendations were graded using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) system, which assesses net benefit and certainty of net benefit (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; fields). The domains considered by the committee to determine the certainty of benefit included the number of trials identified by the search, the number of participants in each trial, the consistency of findings between the trials, and the likelihood that future studies would alter the recommendation of the committee. In addition, the committee members were provided with a report that included risk of bias assessments based on the Cochrane risk of bias tool.</p></div>"/>
