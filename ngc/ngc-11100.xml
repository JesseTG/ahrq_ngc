	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>Can therapeutic interventions reduce osteoporosis-related outcomes in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<p>For men with prostate cancer at high risk of fracture (with or without bone metastases) receiving ADT, denosumab at the osteoporosis-indicated dosage should be considered to reduce the risk of fracture. In situations or jurisdictions where denosumab is contraindicated or not available, a bisphosphonate is a reasonable option.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Can therapeutic interventions prevent bone metastases in men with prostate cancer?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2a</strong></p>
<p>In men with high-risk localized prostate cancer, bisphosphonates are not recommended to reduce the risk of first bone metastasis.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2b</strong></p>
<p>In men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), denosumab at the bone metastasis-indicated dosage is not recommended to reduce the risk of first bone metastasis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>Can bone-targeted therapies reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs), reduce pain, or improve quality of life in men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3a</strong></p>
<p>In men with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), either zoledronic acid (ZA) (minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic disease) or denosumab (disease independent of symptoms) (both at bone metastasis-indicated dosages) is recommended for preventing or delaying SREs. Insufficient evidence exists to make a recommendation with respect to men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastasis.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3b</strong></p>
<p>In men with symptomatic mCRPC and bone pain, radium (Ra)-223 should be considered for reducing symptomatic skeletal events and improving health-related quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3c</strong></p>
<p>In men with mCRPC and bone pain, radiopharmaceuticals or intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates may be considered for pain palliation.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>Can bone-targeted therapies improve overall survival in men with established prostate cancer and bone metastases?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong></p>
<p>In men with symptomatic mCRPC, Ra-223 is recommended to extend overall survival.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search for Existing Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>A search for existing guidelines is generally undertaken prior to searching for existing systematic reviews or primary literature. This is done with the goal of identifying existing guidelines for adaptation or endorsement in order to avoid the duplication of guideline development efforts across jurisdictions. For this project, the following sources were searched for existing guidelines:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Practice guideline databases:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Inventory of Cancer Guidelines </li>
        <li>National Guideline Clearinghouse </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Guideline developer Web sites:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE [UK]) </li>
        <li>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN [UK]) </li>
        <li>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN [US]) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A search for existing guidelines for adaptation or endorsement was conducted and no comprehensive guidelines that covered all types of targeted therapies for bone health were found. A search of the primary literature was required.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Search for Existing Systematic Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p>Systematic reviews were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The searches for systematic reviews done in MEDLINE and EMBASE were combined with those performed for primary literature.</p>
<p>Identified systematic reviews were assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. The results of the AMSTAR assessment were used to determine whether or not an existing review could be incorporated as part of the evidentiary base.</p>
<p>Any identified reviews that did not meet the criteria above, whose AMSTAR assessment indicated important deficiencies in quality, or that were otherwise not incorporated as part of the evidence base were reported in the reference list, but not further described or discussed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>A primary literature search was conducted to ensure the retrieval of the latest studies on bone-targeted therapies. Literature searches were performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to identify primary studies and existing systematic reviews, and the annual meeting proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Urological Association were searched for conference abstracts. MEDLINE was searched in Ovid from 1946 to January 2016 (Ovid MEDLINE&amp;reg; In-Process &amp;amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE&amp;reg; &amp;lt;1946 to Present&amp;gt;). EMBASE was searched in Ovid from 1980 to January 2016 (EMBASE 1996 to 2016 Week 4).</p>
<p>The literature searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE combined methods terms for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with terms describing prostate cancer, bone health, and interventions. The full search strategies are found in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection Criteria and Process</span></strong></p>
<p>Selected studies were required to meet the following inclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>RCTs or systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis) containing RCTs </li>
    <li>The study population consisted of men with prostate cancer at any stage. In studies with mixed populations (i.e., including patients with primary cancer sites other than prostate), the data had to be reported separately for prostate cancer patients to be eligible for inclusion. </li>
    <li>The intervention involved therapies directed at improving bone health in nonmetastatic patients or reducing the outcomes associated with prostate cancer metastatic to bone (drug, supplement, or lifestyle modification) alone or in combination and was compared with placebo, no treatment, or other agents. </li>
</ul>
<p>A review of the titles and abstracts that resulted from the search was conducted by one reviewer. For those items that warranted full-text review, the reviewer reviewed each item and discussed with the lead authors to confirm the final study selections. All data were audited by a second, independent auditor.</p>

<p>Data extraction was conducted by one Working Group member with assistance from the two lead authors. The methodological quality characteristics of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were recorded. These included allocation concealment, blinding, intention-to-treat analysis, funding, patient follow-up, statistical power and sample size, baseline characteristics balance, and early termination. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) status, intervention groups and numbers of patients, dosage schedule, follow-up periods, and outcome measures were recorded for each study.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Synthesizing the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>When clinically homogeneous results from two or more trials were available, a meta-analysis was conducted using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. If the hazard ratio (HR) or its standard error were not reported, they were derived from other information reported in the study, if possible, using the methods described by Parmar et al. For all outcomes, the generic inverse variance model with random effects, or other appropriate random effects models in RevMan was used.</p>
<p>Statistical heterogeneity would be calculated using the &amp;chi;<sup>2</sup> test for heterogeneity and the I<sup>2</sup> percentage. A probability level for the &amp;chi;<sup>2</sup> statistic less than or equal to 10% (p&amp;le;0.10) and/or an I<sup>2</sup> greater than 50% would be considered indicative of statistical heterogeneity.</p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method for assessing the quality of aggregate evidence was used for each comparison. The outcomes were rated for their importance for decision-making by the Working Group members. Four factors were assessed for each outcome in each comparison. These included the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. Risk of bias was assessed by the presence/absence of the methodologic quality characteristics described above.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Developers</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline was undertaken by the Program in Evidence-Based Care (PEBC) at the request of the Genitourinary Cancer Disease Site Group (GU DSG). This group was comprised of four medical oncologists, nine radiation oncologists, seven urologist/surgical oncologists, one pathologist, and one PEBC methodologist (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document for membership).</p>
<p>The project was led by a small Working Group, which was responsible for reviewing the evidence base, drafting the guideline recommendations, and responding to comments received during the document review process. The Working Group members included a geriatrician with expertise in both genitourinary cancer and bone health in men and a radiologist/nuclear medicine physician with expertise in prostate cancer imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy. All members contributed to final interpretation of the evidence, refinement of the recommendations, and approval of the final version of the document. Other members of the GU DSG served as the Expert Panel and were responsible for the review and approval of the draft document produced by the Working Group.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The PEBC produces evidence-based and evidence-informed guidance documents using the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. This process includes a systematic review, interpretation of the evidence by the Working Group, resulting recommendations, internal review by content and methodology experts, and external review by Ontario clinicians and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The PEBC uses the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) framework as a methodological strategy for guideline development. AGREE II is a 23-item validated tool that is designed to assess the methodological rigour and transparency of guideline development.</p>
<p>The currency of each document is ensured through periodic review and evaluation of the scientific literature and, where appropriate, the addition of newer literature to the original evidence base. This is described in the PEBC Document Assessment and Review Protocol (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). PEBC guideline recommendations are based on clinical evidence, and not on feasibility of implementation; however, a list of implementation considerations such as costs, human resources, and unique requirements for special or disadvantaged populations is provided along with the recommendations for information purposes. PEBC guideline development methods are described in more detail in the PEBC Handbook and the PEBC Methods Handbook (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Research Questions</span></strong></p>

    <li>Can therapeutic interventions reduce osteoporosis-related outcomes in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT? </li>
    <li>Can therapeutic interventions prevent bone metastases in men with prostate cancer? </li>
    <li>Can bone-targeted therapies reduce the incidence of SREs, reduce pain, or improve quality of life in men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone? </li>

<p><strong>Internal Review</strong></p>
<p>For the guideline document to be approved, 75% of the content experts who comprise the Guideline Development Group (GDG) Expert Panel must cast a vote indicating whether or not they approve the document, or abstain from voting for a specified reason, and of those that vote, 75% must approve the document. In addition, the Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) Report Approval Panel (RAP), a three-person panel with methodology expertise, must unanimously approve the document. The Expert Panel and RAP members may specify that approval is conditional, and that changes to the document are required. If substantial changes are subsequently made to the recommendations during external review, then the revised draft must be resubmitted for approval by RAP and the GDG Expert Panel.</p>
<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>Feedback on the approved draft guideline is obtained from content experts and the target users through two processes. Through the targeted peer review, several individuals with content expertise are identified by the GDG and asked to review and provide feedback on the guideline document. Through professional consultation, relevant care providers and other potential users of the guideline are contacted and asked to provide feedback on the guideline recommendations through a brief online survey. This consultation is intended to facilitate the dissemination of the final guidance report to Ontario practitioners.</p>
