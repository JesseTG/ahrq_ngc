	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Two separate systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to evaluate the recall and maintenance regimens for tooth- and implant-borne restoration. The detailed methodology for the search processes are described in the respective systematic review articles (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Tooth-Borne Restorations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong></p>
<p>An electronic search of the English language literature was performed independently by two investigators using the PubMed search engine and Cochrane Library database. The specific search terms, search string, and limits are presented in Table 1 in the systematic review on tooth-borne restorations.</p>
<p>The specific PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparatives, Outcomes) question for this systematic review was: in patients with tooth-borne restorations, does one specific recall regimen and dental maintenance regimen, or no regimen, improve clinical outcomes and patient care and optimize maintenance of oral health?</p>
<p>The period searched was from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2014. The search limits applied to the electronic search were the English language, search period, and clinical studies. The anticipated tooth-borne restorations of interest in this study were intracoronal restorations, extracoronal restorations, single crowns, veneers, fixed dental prostheses (FDP), and partial removable dental prostheses (RDP).</p>
<p>The predetermined inclusion criteria were (1) English language article in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) any clinical study published between January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2014; and (3) any clinical study with the primary focus on patient recall regimen, professional maintenance, or home maintenance regimen for tooth-borne restorations, in healthy patients.</p>
<p>The predetermined exclusion criteria were (1) articles that did not pertain to items described in the inclusion criteria; (2) articles that did not pertain to the objectives of the systematic review; (3) articles that did not describe data on recall and maintenance of patients with tooth-borne restorations; (4) articles that described data on unhealthy patients or patients with periodontal disease; (5) review articles or technique articles without associated clinical study and data; (6) patients or data being repeated in other included articles; and (7) article description that would not allow extraction of qualitative or quantitative data related to objectives of the study.</p>
<p>The electronic search process was systematically conducted in three stages. A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) format was used as a filter to remove duplicate articles and to ensure a systematic search process. In stage 1, the investigators independently screened all relevant titles of the electronic search, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion. In situations where the application of the exclusion criteria was not clear, the controversial article was included for consideration in the abstract stage. In stage 2, the investigators independently analyzed the abstracts of all selected titles, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. In situations of uncertainty, the abstract was included for the subsequent full-text stage.</p>
<p>After the application of the exclusion criteria, the definitive list of articles was screened at stage 3 by the investigators to extract qualitative and quantitative data (when available). A supplemental electronic search for articles from Scopus, Google Scholar, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) search engines along with a hand search of references of all included articles was conducted using systematic methods. Additionally, articles that had a lag time to appear on the PubMed search engine were also screened for the three stages, as part of the supplemental search. Data from all included studies were then tabulated, analyzed, and compared to satisfy the objectives of the review.</p>

A rating scheme for strength of recommendation as described by Shekelle et al. was used as it was most applicable to this topic and is widely used and validated in the medical literature (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). The major outcomes and consequences considered during formulation of these clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were (1) risk for failure of tooth-borne restorations and (2) risk for failure of implant-borne restorations. Thereafter, the members of the task force conducted a roundtable peer review/evaluation discussion of the proposed guidelines, and the guidelines were debated in detail. These inputs were used to supplement and refine the proposed guidelines, and consensus was attained for the various guidelines presented.</p>
<p>The strength of evidence and subsequent recommendations that is presently available was applied for each guideline. When a guideline comprised multiple aspects, multiple strengths of available recommendations in descending order were applied. Additionally, when multiple strengths of recommendations were available for a specific guideline, they were all applied accordingly.</p>
<p>A potential source of bias that was considered during development of the CPGs was the same group serving as authors of the systematic reviews as well as panel members for the CPG. To minimize this potential bias, efforts were made during the scientific panel meetings to debate and justify each guideline in an open and transparent format. Strength of evidence was debated for every guideline. Thus, the effect of &quot;groupthink&quot; may not be a source of bias in this baseline CPG document. Conversely, having the same author group to draft the CPGs may be viewed as a strength of this document, due to the profound insight obtained by the author group during the systematic review process.</p>
<p>Most of the guidelines in this document are graded as category D for strength of recommendation but it is anticipated that the strength of recommendation would be higher in the future. Using Shekelle's method for grading the strength of recommendation allowed incorporation and delineation of various types of evidence, including expert opinion/consensus, into four categories, while formulating these guidelines. Additionally, it allowed extrapolation of higher categories of evidence to lower categories and provided more freedom in designation of an article to a specific category. The authors considered other widely popular alternatives such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, and the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) method. However, these alternatives were less applicable to the topic of this baseline CPG. The GRADE method divides the expression of evidence into only two categories, weak or strong, which was not appropriate for this baseline CPG. The SORT method divides the strength of recommendation into three categories (A, B and C) but does not allow extrapolation of higher categories of evidence to lower categories.</p></div>"/>
