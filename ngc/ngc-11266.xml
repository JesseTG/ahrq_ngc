	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Evaluation and Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In patients with a solid or complex cystic renal mass, physicians should obtain high quality, multiphase, cross-sectional abdominal imaging to optimally characterize and clinically stage the renal mass. Characterization of the renal mass should include assessment of tumor complexity, degree of contrast enhancement (where applicable), and presence or absence of fat. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients with suspected renal malignancy, physicians should obtain comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis. Metastatic evaluation should include chest imaging to evaluate for possible thoracic metastases. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with a solid or complex cystic renal mass, physicians should assign chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and degree of proteinuria. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Counseling</strong></span></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>In patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, a urologist should lead the counseling process and should consider all management strategies. A multidisciplinary team should be included when necessary. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Physicians should provide counseling that includes current perspectives about tumor biology and a patient-specific risk assessment inclusive of sex, tumor size/complexity, histology (when obtained), and imaging characteristics. For cT1a tumors, the low oncologic risk of many small renal masses should be reviewed. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>During counseling of patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, physicians must review the most common and serious urologic and non-urologic morbidities of each treatment pathway and the importance of patient age, comorbidities/frailty, and life expectancy. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>Physicians should review the importance of renal functional recovery related to renal mass management, including the risk of progressive CKD, potential short- or long-term need for renal replacement therapy, and long-term overall survival considerations. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>Physicians should consider referral to nephrology in patients with a high risk of CKD progression. Such patients may include those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, confirmed proteinuria, diabetics with preexisting CKD, or whenever eGFR is expected to be less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> after intervention. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Physicians should recommend genetic counseling for all patients &amp;le;46 years of age with renal malignancy and consider genetic counseling for patients with multifocal or bilateral renal masses, or if personal or family history suggests a familial renal neoplastic syndrome. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Renal Mass Biopsy (RMB)</strong></span></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>
    <li>RMB should be considered when a mass is suspected to be hematologic, metastatic, inflammatory, or infectious. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>In the setting of a solid renal mass, RMB is not required for: 1) young or healthy patients who are unwilling to accept the uncertainties associated with RMB; or 2) older or frail patients who will be managed conservatively independent of RMB findings. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>When considering the utility of RMB, patients should be counseled regarding rationale, positive and negative predictive values, potential risks and non-diagnostic rates of RMB. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with a solid renal mass who elect RMB, multiple core biopsies are preferred over fine needle aspiration. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Management</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Partial Nephrectomy (PN) and Nephron-sparing Approaches</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;14&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should prioritize PN for the management of the cT1a renal mass when intervention is indicated. In this setting, PN minimizes the risk of CKD or CKD progression and is associated with favorable oncologic outcomes, including excellent local control. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Physicians should prioritize nephron-sparing approaches for patients with solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal masses and an anatomic or functionally solitary kidney, bilateral tumors, known familial renal cell carcinoma (RCC), preexisting CKD, or proteinuria. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Physicians should consider nephron-sparing approaches for patients with solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal masses who are young, have multifocal masses, or comorbidities that are likely to impact renal function in the future, such as moderate to severe hypertension, diabetes mellitus, recurrent urolithiasis, or morbid obesity. (<strong>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients who elect PN, physicians should prioritize preservation of renal function through efforts to optimize nephron mass preservation and avoidance of prolonged warm ischemia. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients undergoing PN, negative surgical margins should be a priority. The extent of normal parenchyma removed should be determined by surgeon discretion taking into account the clinical situation, tumor characteristics including growth pattern, and interface with normal tissue. Tumor enucleation should be considered in patients with familial RCC, multifocal disease, or severe CKD to optimize parenchymal mass preservation. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Radical Nephrectomy (RN)</strong></p>

    <li>Physicians should consider RN for patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass where increased oncologic potential is suggested by tumor size, RMB, and/or imaging characteristics and in whom active treatment is planned. (<strong>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B</strong>) In this setting, RN is preferred if all of the following criteria are met: 1) high tumor complexity and PN would be challenging even in experienced hands; 2) no preexisting CKD or proteinuria; and 3) normal contralateral kidney and new baseline eGFR will likely be greater than 45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Surgical Principles</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;20&quot;>
    <li>For patients who are undergoing surgical excision of a renal mass with clinically concerning regional lymphadenopathy, physicians should perform a lymph node dissection for staging purposes. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients who are undergoing surgical excision of a renal mass, physicians should perform adrenalectomy if imaging and/or intraoperative findings suggest metastasis or direct invasion of the adrenal gland. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing surgical excision of a renal mass, a minimally invasive approach should be considered when it would not compromise oncologic, functional and perioperative outcomes. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pathologic evaluation of the adjacent renal parenchyma should be performed after PN or RN to assess for possible intrinsic renal disease, particularly for patients with CKD or risk factors for developing CKD. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Thermal Ablation (TA)</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;24&quot;>
    <li>Physicians should consider TA as an alternate approach for the management of cT1a renal masses &amp;lt;3 cm in size. For patients who elect TA, a percutaneous technique is preferred over a surgical approach whenever feasible to minimize morbidity. (<strong>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Both radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation are options for patients who elect thermal ablation. (<strong>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>A renal mass biopsy should be performed prior to ablation to provide pathologic diagnosis and guide subsequent surveillance. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Counseling about thermal ablation should include information regarding an increased likelihood of tumor persistence or local recurrence after primary thermal ablation relative to surgical extirpation, which may be addressed with repeat ablation if further intervention is elected. (<strong>Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Active Surveillance (AS)</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;28&quot;>
    <li>For patients with small solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal masses, especially those &amp;lt;2 cm, AS is an option for initial management. (<strong>Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, physicians should prioritize active surveillance/expectant management when the anticipated risk of intervention or competing risks of death outweigh the potential oncologic benefits of active treatment. (<strong>Clinical Principle</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass in whom the risk/benefit analysis for treatment is equivocal and who prefer AS, physicians should repeat imaging in 3 to 6 months to assess for interval growth and may consider RMB for additional risk stratification. (<strong>Expert Opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass in whom the anticipated oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death, physicians should recommend active treatment. In this setting, AS with potential for delayed intervention may be pursued only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risk.

<p>Paired investigators independently screened search results to assess eligibility. Investigators abstracted data sequentially and assessed risk of bias independently. Investigators graded the strength of evidence as a group. Citations were screened independently by two reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria. One reviewer completed data abstraction and a second reviewer checked abstraction for accuracy. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias for individual studies. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used for assessing the risk of bias of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For nonrandomized studies of treatment interventions, the reviewers used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI). For diagnostic studies, the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) was used. Differences between reviewers were resolved through consensus. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Determination of Evidence Strength</strong></span></p>
<p>The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies. Evidence strength refers to the body of evidence available for a particular question and includes not only individual study quality but consideration of study design, consistency of findings across studies, adequacy of sample sizes, and generalizability of samples, settings, and treatments for the purposes of the guideline. See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field for the categories of the body of evidence.</p>

<p>The Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer Panel was created in 2014 by the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA). The Practice Guidelines Committee (PGC) of the AUA selected the Panel Chair who in turn appointed the Vice Chair. In a collaborative process, additional Panel members, including additional members of the College of American Pathologists (CAP), Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), American College of Radiology (ACR), American Society of Nephrology (ASN), Endourological Society, and Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) with specific expertise in this area, were then nominated and approved by the PGC.</p>

    <li>Recognition of familial forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can be of great benefit to patients and their families. Proactive management of RCC and other familial manifestations may considerably lessen the morbidity and mortality associated with these syndromes. </li>
    <li>Radical nephrectomy (RN) is associated with favorable perioperative outcomes and a low risk of urologic complications compared to partial nephrectomy (PN). </li>
    <li>PN offers excellent preservation of renal parenchyma and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). </li>
    <li>In the systematic review, thermal ablation (TA) had the most favorable perioperative outcome profile and a similar low risk of harms when compared to other strategies. Success rates with TA are highest with small peripheral tumors. </li>
    <li>Active surveillance (AS) offers favorable oncologic and overall survival outcomes in well-selected patients, albeit in limited studies with relatively short follow-up. AS forgoes the operative risks associated with other management strategies. </li>

    <li>The risks of diagnostic studies include radiation exposure (CT) and contrast administration (gadolinium-induced nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and contrast-induced nephropathy or allergic reaction). </li>
    <li>It should be noted that each treatment strategy (radical nephrectomy [RN], partial nephrectomy [PN], or thermal ablation [TA]) has similar rates of minor and major complications but a unique profile of these complications that should be discussed with patients. </li>
    <li>Radical nephrectomy (RN) is associated with the greatest decrease in glomerular filtration rate and highest risk of de novo chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or higher. </li>
    <li>Partial nephrectomy (PN) carries a higher risk of blood transfusions and urologic complications (e.g., urine leak) than other modalities. These complications may subject a small proportion of patients to additional treatments (e.g., ureteral stents, abdominal drains, embolization of pseudoaneurysm). </li>
    <li>Thermal ablation (TA) carries an inferior local recurrence free survival (LRFS) when considering primary efficacy that may mandate secondary interventions. </li>
    <li>Active surveillance potentially introduces anxieties and oncologic risks not suitable for all patients. </li>

    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses ('off label') that are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not intended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
