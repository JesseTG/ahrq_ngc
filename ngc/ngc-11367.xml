	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Preoperative Measures</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Information for Patients</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who are going to undergo abdominal surgery, does information on the process (via clinic) help reduce the length of hospital stays?</em></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Oral and written information should be given to patients who are going to undergo major abdominal surgery, describing what will take place during the entire hospital stay, resolving any doubts and making the patient a participant in the surgical process. </p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended that the information that is communicated to the patient who is going to undergo major abdominal surgery be agreed upon previously by a multi-disciplinary team to promote a comprehensive understanding of the surgical process. </p>
<p><strong>Nutritional Screening</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who are going to undergo abdominal surgery, does the study of the state of the patient's nutritional state reduce postoperative complications (morbi-mortality)?</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Nutritional screening of all patients who are going to undergo major abdominal surgery is recommended. </p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The assessment of the patient's nutritional state should be done during the preoperative visit to allow sufficient time for the nutritional support teams present in each centre to take the necessary measures based on the results of the assessment. </p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended that nutritional treatment be initiated during the preoperative period in all patients identified as being at risk of malnutrition during the nutritional screening. </p>
<p><strong>Carbohydrate Drinks</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who are going to undergo elective major abdominal surgery, does the administration of carbohydrate drinks (two hours before surgery), versus not administering anything, reduce postoperative complications? Does it shorten hospital stays? </em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In non-diabetic patients who are going to undergo elective major abdominal surgery, the administration of 200 to 400 mL of a carbohydrate drink that contains at least 50 g of glucose, up to 2 hours prior to the surgical procedure, is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In non-diabetic patients who are going to undergo elective major abdominal surgery, it must be taken into account that the administration, up to 2 hours prior to surgery, of clear carbohydrate liquids is safe, not associated with any harmful effects for patients, such as vomiting or aspiration pneumonitis. </p>
<p><strong>Anaesthetic Premedication</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who are going to undergo elective major abdominal surgery, is there any evidence to support that not giving preanaesthetic medication can reduce or prevent postoperative ileus?</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The use of intermediate or long-acting sedative and/or anxiolytic premedication in patients who undergo major abdominal surgery is not recommended. </p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - In cases in which the administration of anxiolytic premedication is deemed necessary, short-acting benzodiazepines (BDZs) are recommended.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Intraoperative Measures</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Recovery After Abdominal Surgery (ERAS) and Laparoscopic Surgery</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who undergo elective major abdominal surgery, do the following interventions reduce morbi-mortality and hospital stays when compared with the use of laparoscopy and conventional perioperative care?</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><em>Laparoscopy + ERAS</em> </li>
    <li><em>Laparotomy + ERAS</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients who are going to undergo elective colorectal surgery, the laparoscopic approach is recommended, in combination with the application of an intensified abdominal surgery recovery program. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Perioperative Measures</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fluid Therapy</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who undergo elective major abdominal surgery, does the use of a goal-directed fluid therapy algorithm, versus restrictive fluid therapy, reduce postoperative complications? Does it shorten postoperative ileus? Does it shorten hospital stays?</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Colorectal surgery that falls within the scope of a program of enhanced recovery after abdominal surgery (ERAS) should include a personalized fluid therapy plan for each patient. </p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Abdominal surgery that falls within the scope of an ERAS program should include a personalized fluid therapy plan for each patient. </p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients who undergo colorectal surgery, the use of a haemodynamic goal-directed fluid therapy algorithm is suggested when the necessary human and technical resources are available. </p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients with low surgical risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] I or II) who undergo colorectal surgery within the scope of an ERAS program, evaluate the possibility of applying an intraoperative fluid handling strategy with a balance close to zero. </p>
<p><strong>Analgesia</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who undergo elective major abdominal surgery, is transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block more effective and safer than epidural analgesia?</em></p>
<p>Scientific evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation in favour of or against the use of TAP block for postoperative analgesia in major abdominal surgery. </p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - If the TAP technique is used for postoperative analgesia, it should be applied via catheter with continuous perfusion. </p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Postoperative Measures</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Early Reinitiation of Oral Feeding</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who undergo elective major abdominal surgery, does the early administration of oral nutrition versus not administering anything shorten postoperative ileus?</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients who have undergone colorectal surgery, surgery of the small intestine, or gynaecological abdominal surgery, it is recommended that oral ingestion of liquids and solids begin as soon as possible, based on the tolerance of the patient, preferably within the first 24 hours after the surgical procedure, with the possibility of resuming oral feeding starting 4 hours after surgery. </p>
<p><strong>Early Mobilization</strong></p>
<p><em>In patients who undergo elective major abdominal surgery, does early mobilization (getting out of bed within the first 6 hours) versus remaining in bed shorten postoperative ileus?</em> </p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Implement a plan of perioperative care that promotes early and progressive mobilization of the patient, getting the patient out of bed on the same day of the surgery, and starting to walk within the first 24 hours following the surgery. </p>

    <li>Bibliography search, with de novo preparation of strategies for all questions.

The searches were limited to the types of studies that were most suitable based on the characteristics of the question and the languages of Spanish, French, and English. The search period covered from 2000 to 2014, through the months between May and July. Also, automatic email alerts were configured for new articles added to MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library after July 2014. A reverse search was done in the references of the articles identified and included in the guidelines. A non-systematic search of grey literature was also done. </li>
    <li>Initially, the studies that were returned were screened by title and abstract. In a second screening, the discarded studies were recorded and the causes for exclusion were specified. </li>

    <li>Creation of a guideline working group made up of 11 healthcare professionals from different disciplines in the area of hospital care, from different regions and different specializations (general surgery, nursing, anaesthesiology, endocrinology and nutrition, urology) and 2 specialists in methodology from the Institute of Health Sciences of Aragon (IACS). To prepare the material aimed at patients, family members, and caregivers, the Work Group was assisted by a patient who had undergone major abdominal surgery (MAS) and had participated in an enhanced recovery after abdominal surgery (ERAS) program. Also, the information aimed at patients, family members, and caregivers was revised by three non-medical persons to ensure that it was suitable and understandable. </li>
    <li>Formulation of recommendations based on the &quot;formal evaluation&quot; or &quot;justified opinion&quot; of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). The classification of the evidence and the grading of the recommendations were done using the system proposed by SIGN. In addition to the volume and quality of the evidence, the guideline working group (GWG) had to consider the applicability of the results found, the concordance of the results, and the relevance of their application to the National Health System, or their clinical impact. Recommendations that were controversial or that lacked evidence were resolved by consensus in two meetings of the working group. </li>

<p>The clinical practice guideline (CPG) is a tool to assist professionals and users to make decisions regarding the most appropriate health care. The introduction and implementation of the recommendations in these guidelines in the healthcare sectors in which their application is pertinent is therefore necessary. The following strategies are recommended to do this: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Presentation of the CPG by the healthcare authorities to the communication <span>team</span>. </li>
    <li>Presentation of the guidelines to the directorates and deputy directorates of Specialized Care of the different regional health services. </li>
    <li>Institutional presentation of the guidelines to the different scientific societies and associations involved. </li>
    <li>Collaboration with the scientific societies and associations that participated in the review of the CPG, to promote dissemination. </li>
    <li>Sending the CPG to the different databases that collect information on CPGs, for evaluation and inclusion. </li>
    <li>Free access to the different versions of the CPG at the <a href=&quot;http://www.guiasalud.es&quot; title=&quot;GuíaSalud Web site&quot;>Gu&amp;iacute;aSalud Web site</a>. </li>
    <li>Dissemination and information on the CPG at scientific activities related to enhanced recovery in abdominal surgery, general surgery, and surgery of the digestive tract, anaesthesiology and reanimation, urology, gynaecology, and nursing. </li>
    <li>Publication of the guidelines in medical magazines. </li>
    <li>Translation of the complete version into English. </li>
</ul>
<p>For the implementation of the recommendations of the guidelines, the methodology included in the <em>Methodological Manual for the Implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines in the National Health System </em>is proposed. A multidisciplinary team should be created to assume the coordination and leadership of the process. This team will prepare the planning of the implementation, which should include the diagnosis of the practical situation in regard to the recommendations to be implemented, the analysis of potential barriers and facilitating elements, the design and implementation of intervention strategies, as well as the design of a plan that makes it possible to evaluate the development of the implementation process itself, as well as the degree of adjustment and results of the clinical practices.</p></div>"/>
