	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>These guidelines are based on a systematic search of available research evidence.</p>
<p>Systematic searches were conducted of the MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), and Cochrane (Wiley) databases. The search terms and limits used are available on request from the American Psychiatric Association (APA).</p>
<p>Search strategies were constructed that included a full range of topics related to psychiatric evaluation given the expected overlap in the retrieved literature for specific guideline questions. An initial search of MEDLINE was conducted in October 2010. This search yielded 250,981 articles. A second set of searches was conducted in October 2011. These searches yielded 32,895 articles in MEDLINE, 7,052 articles in PsycINFO, and 5,986 articles in the Cochrane database. All searches were done for the years from 1900 to the time of the search.</p>
<p>One individual screened 95,166 references from the 2010 search, spanning the years from 2005 to 2010. A second individual screened the 32,895 references from the 2011 search after duplicate articles from the different searches were eliminated. Included articles were those that pertained to a clinical trial (including a controlled or randomized trial), observational study, meta-analysis, or systematic review and were clinically relevant to psychiatric evaluation (i.e., relevant to any possible clinical question that might be addressed by potential APA practice guidelines). Excluded references included articles on nosology of psychiatric disorders, risk factors or associated features of specific disorders, potential etiologies of specific disorders, and course and prognosis of specific disorders. Studies of psychiatric treatments were included only if they also included information about the specific effects of psychiatric evaluation. Due to the large number of articles that were screened, the specific reasons for exclusion or inclusion of each article were not recorded.</p>
<p>A total of 5,073 articles met the broad inclusion criteria. These articles were screened for relevance to the clinical questions formulated for these guidelines and described under &quot;Review of Supporting Research Evidence: Clinical Questions&quot; in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>For inclusion, a study needed to address an appropriate population of patients in a psychiatric setting who were receiving a psychiatric evaluation. Studies of patients who were seen by psychiatric consultants in a medical setting were included. The &quot;intervention&quot; was considered to be assessing a patient for a specific element of the evaluation. The &quot;comparator&quot; could include care as usual and was sometimes non-specific. The &quot;outcomes&quot; used were those specified by the PICOTS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time, Setting) questions. Given the limited number of studies that addressed effects of psychiatric evaluation, reviewers erred on the side of using broader definitions of comparators, outcomes and assessment timing. However, studies of sensitivity and specificity of rating scales as compared to structured interviews were not included unless they specifically addressed a discrete PICOTS &quot;outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>An update of the literature search was conducted in September 2014 using the same databases and search strategies used for the October 2011 search. These searches in September 2014 yielded 8,521 additional articles in MEDLINE, 1,980 additional articles in PsycINFO, and 1,310 additional articles in the Cochrane database. After duplicates were eliminated, 11,644 abstracts were screened for relevance by two individuals. A total of 65 additional references met the broad inclusion criteria, and of these, 1 study was relevant to quantitative assessment.</p>
<p>For supporting sections of these guidelines (e.g., rationale, implementation), additional targeted searches of the literature were conducted to identify relevant references.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>These guidelines were developed using a process intended to meet standards of the Institute of Medicine (2011). The process is fully described in a document available on the <a href=&quot;http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/Guideline-Development-Process.pdf&quot; title=&quot;APA Web site&quot;>American Psychiatric Association (APA) Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Work Group Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>Because these guidelines addressed aspects of a psychiatric evaluation, the work group was composed of psychiatrists. However, some experts from other disciplines were included in the expert panel that was surveyed, as described under &quot;Expert Opinion Data Collection&quot; below. The work group was diverse and balanced with respect to their expertise as well as other characteristics, such as geographical location and demographic background. Methodological expertise (i.e., with respect to appraisal of strength of research evidence) was provided by the Systematic Review Group. A patient advocate was involved as an advisor during question formulation and draft review.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Expert Opinion Data Collection</span></strong></p>
<p>An expert opinion survey was fielded to a panel of 1,738 experts in psychiatric evaluation and management. The response rate for the survey was 45.1% (n=784); 8.4% of the responses were partial, meaning that at least one of the eight sections of the survey was completed. Members of the panel were peer-nominated in 2011 by current and past APA work group members, chairs of academic departments of psychiatry and directors of psychiatry residency programs in the United States and Canada, and the APA Assembly. Survey questions were adapted from clinical questions developed by an APA expert work group and reviewed by a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders. The survey included questions to address which types of assessments improve identification of patients at risk for suicide and whether the experts typically perform such assessments in practice.</p>
<p>Nominators were asked to identify two types of experts to serve on the panel: researchers and clinicians. &quot;Research experts&quot; were defined as individuals who are making substantial contributions, via research or scholarly writing, to the area of psychiatric evaluation and management. &quot;Clinical experts&quot; were defined as individuals who have substantial clinical experience in the psychiatric evaluation of adults or an expert clinician whom the nominator might consult about an adult patient with a complex presentation. The panel was composed of approximately 70% clinical experts, 20% research experts, and 10% experts in both categories. Most of the panel members, 76.4%, were nominated once, 14.8% were nominated twice, and the remainder were nominated up to nine times. The majority of the panel members were contacted via email to complete the survey online; 1.8% were contacted via mail and 0.6% were not contacted because of lack of email or mailing address or inability to distinguish the intended nominee because of common names.</p>
<p>The composition of the portion of the panel who responded to the survey corresponds closely with that of the entire panel, within 0%&amp;ndash;4% (i.e., in the number of times panel members were nominated and whether they were identified as clinical or research experts or both).</p>
<p>For each guideline, quantitative data from the survey are shown under &quot;Review of Available Evidence&quot; in the original guideline document. The survey also collected many free text comments, which were reviewed during development of the draft guidelines. Key themes from qualitative data have been incorporated into the implementation section of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Rating the Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Each guideline statement is separately rated to indicate strength of recommendation and strength of supporting research evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Strength of recommendation&quot; describes the level of confidence that potential benefits of an intervention outweigh potential harms. This level of confidence is informed by available evidence, which includes evidence from clinical trials as well as expert opinion and patient values and preferences. The rating is a consensus judgment of the authors of the guideline and is endorsed by the APA Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>There are two possible ratings: recommendation or suggestion. These correspond to ratings of &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; (also termed &quot;conditional&quot;) as defined under the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method for rating recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (described in publications such as Guyatt et al. 2008 and others available on the Web site of the GRADE Working Group at <a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Working Group Web site&quot;>http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/</a>). See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p>When a negative statement is made, ratings of strength of recommendation should be understood as meaning the inverse of the above (e.g., &quot;recommendation&quot; indicates confidence that harms clearly outweigh benefits).</p>
<p>When there is insufficient information to support a recommendation or a suggestion, a statement may be made that further research about the intervention is needed.</p>
<p>The work group determined ratings of strength of recommendation by the Delphi method&amp;mdash;that is, through blind, iterative voting and discussion. In weighing potential benefits and harms, the group considered the strength of supporting research evidence, the results of the expert opinion survey, and their own clinical experiences and opinions. For recommendations, at least seven of the eight members of the group must have voted to &quot;recommend&quot; the intervention or assessment after three rounds of voting. If this level of consensus was not achieved, the work group could agree to make a &quot;suggestion&quot; rather than a recommendation. No suggestion or statement was made if three or more work group members voted &quot;no statement.&quot; Differences of opinion within the group about ratings of strength of recommendation, if any, are described under &quot;Review of Available Evidence&quot; in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Proper Use of Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guidelines are not intended to serve or be construed as a &quot;standard of medical care.&quot; Judgments concerning clinical care depend on the clinical circumstances and data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and practice patterns evolve. These guideline statements were determined on the basis of the relative balance of potential benefits and harms of a specific assessment, intervention, or other approach to care. As such, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effects of omitting a particular recommendation, either in general or for a specific patient. Furthermore, adherence to these guidelines will not ensure a successful outcome for every individual, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as including all proper methods of evaluation and care or excluding other acceptable methods of evaluation and care aimed at the same results. The ultimate recommendation regarding a particular assessment, clinical procedure, or treatment plan must be made by the psychiatrist in light of the psychiatric evaluation, other clinical data, and the diagnostic and treatment options available. Such recommendations should be made in collaboration with the patient and family, whenever possible, and incorporate the patient's personal and sociocultural preferences and values in order to enhance the therapeutic alliance, adherence to treatment, and treatment outcomes.</p></div>"/>
