	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Treatment Goals for Cushing's Syndrome</strong></span></p>
<p>In patients with overt Cushing's syndrome (CS), the Task Force recommends normalizing cortisol levels or action at its receptors to eliminate the signs and symptoms of CS and treating co-morbidities associated with hypercortisolism. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against treatment to reduce cortisol levels or action if there is not an established diagnosis of CS. (<strong>1|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against treatments designed to normalize cortisol or its action when there is only borderline biochemical abnormality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis without any specific signs of CS. The benefit of treating to normalize cortisol is not established in this setting. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Optimal Adjunctive Management</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends providing education to patients and their family/caretaker(s) about their disease, treatment options, and what to expect after remission. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that all patients receive monitoring and adjunctive treatment for cortisol-dependent comorbidities (psychiatric disorders, diabetes, hypertension, hypokalemia, infections, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and poor physical fitness). (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that a multidisciplinary team, including an experienced endocrinologist, takes patient values and preferences into consideration and provides education about the treatment options to the patient. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests evaluating CS patients for risk factors of venous thrombosis. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with CS undergoing surgery, the Task Force suggests perioperative prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that clinicians discuss and offer age appropriate vaccinations to CS patients-particularly influenza, <em>Herpes zoster</em>, and pneumococcal vaccinations - due to an increased risk of infection. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>First-Line Treatment Options</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends initial resection of primary lesion(s) underlying Cushing's disease (CD), ectopic and adrenal (cancer, adenoma, and bilateral disease) etiologies, unless surgery is not possible or is unlikely to significantly reduce glucocorticoid excess (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends unilateral resection by an experienced adrenal surgeon for all cases of benign unilateral disease. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends localizing and resecting ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumors with node dissection as appropriate. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy (TSS) by an experienced pituitary surgeon as the optimal treatment for CD in pediatric and adult patients. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measuring serum sodium several times during the first 5&amp;ndash;14 days after TSS. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends assessing free thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and prolactin within 1&amp;ndash;2 weeks of surgery, to evaluate for overt hypopituitarism. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends obtaining a postoperative pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan within 1&amp;ndash;3 months of successful TSS. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends surgical resection of bilateral ad renal disorders (<strong>1|++OO</strong>) and suggests medical therapy to block aberrant hormone receptors for bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) (<strong>2|++OO</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Remission and Recurrence after Surgical Tumor Resection</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests an individualized management approach based on whether the postoperative serum cortisol values categorize the patient's condition as hypocortisolism, hypercortisolism, or eucortisolism. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends additional treatments in patients with persistent overt hypercortisolism. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measuring late-night salivary or serum cortisol in patients with eucortisolism after TSS, including those cases where eucortisolism was established by medical treatment before surgery. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends using tests to screen for hypercortisolism to assess for recurrence in patients with ACTH-dependent CS. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Glucocorticoid Replacement and Discontinuation, and Resolution of Other Hormonal Deficiencies</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that hypocortisolemic patients receive glucocorticoid replacement and education about adrenal insufficiency after surgical remission. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends follow-up morning cortisol and/or ACTH stimulation tests or insulin-induced hypoglycemia to assess the recovery of the HPA axis in patients with at least one intact adrenal gland, assuming there are no contraindications. The Task Force also recommends discontinuing glucocorticoid when the response to these test(s) is normal. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends reevaluating the need for treatment of other pituitary hormone deficiencies in the postoperative period. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Second-Line Therapeutic Options</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients with ACTH-dependent CS who underwent a noncurative surgery or for whom surgery was not possible, the Task Force suggests a shared decision-making approach because there are several available second-line therapies (e.g., repeat TSS, radiation therapy [RT], medical therapy, and bilateral adrenalectomy). (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests bilateral adrenalectomy for occult or metastatic ectopic ACTH secretion (EAS) or as a life-preserving emergency treatment in patients with very severe ACTH-dependent disease who cannot be promptly controlled by medical therapy. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends regularly evaluating for corticotrope tumor progression using pituitary MRIs and ACTH levels in patients with known CD who undergo bilateral adrenalectomy and in patients who undergo this procedure for presumed occult EAS (because some of the latter have a pituitary and not ectopic tumor). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Repeat Transsphenoidal Surgery</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests repeat TSS, particularly in patients with evidence of incomplete resection, or a pituitary lesion on imaging. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Radiation Therapy/Radiosurgery for CD</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends confirming that medical therapy is effective in normalizing cortisol before administering radiation RT/radiosurgery (RS) for this goal because this will be needed while awaiting the effect of radiation. (<strong>1|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests RT/RS in patients who have failed TSS or have recurrent CD. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends using RT where there are concerns about the mass effects or invasion associated with corticotroph adenomas. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measuring serum cortisol or urine free cortisol (UFC) off-medication at 6- to 12-month intervals to assess the effect of RT and also if patients develop new adrenal insufficiency symptoms while on stable medical therapy. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Medical Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends steroidogenesis inhibitors under the following conditions: as second-line treatment after TSS in patients with CD, either with or without RT/RS; as primary treatment of EAS in patients with occult or metastatic EAS; and as adjunctive treatment to reduce cortisol levels in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests pituitary-directed medical treatments in patients with CD who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after TSS. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests administering a glucocorticoid antagonist in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after TSS. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests targeted therapies to treat ectopic ACTH syndrome. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Approach for Long-Term Follow-up</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends treating the specific comorbidities associated with CS (e.g., cardiovascular risk factors, osteoporosis and psychiatric symptoms) in all patients with CS throughout their lives until resolution (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The Task Force also recommends testing for recurrence throughout life, except in patients who underwent resection of an adrenal adenoma with a computerized tomography (CT) density of &amp;lt;10 Hounsfield units. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends educating patients and families about the clinical features of remission. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with adrenal adenoma, the Task Force suggests follow-up tests for the specific comorbidities associated with CS if the adenoma density on CT was &amp;lt; 10 Hounsfield units. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>) For those with higher Hounsfield unit values or pathology consistent with possible carcinoma, the Task Force suggests evaluating for malignancy using imaging. (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that patients with Carney complex have lifelong follow-up tests for cardiac myxoma and other associated disease (testicular tumors, acromegaly, thyroid lesions). (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>

<p>The three systematic reviews summarized data from 29 case series of radiation therapy (RT) in Cushing's disease (CD), 21 case series of radiosurgery in CD, and 87 case series of treatment-naive CD patients who received first-line transsphenoidal surgery. The outcomes of interest were biochemical remission and biochemical recurrence rates.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Methods</strong></span></p>
<p>For all three systematic reviews, the search included the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, and Scopus. The Task Force expanded the search to include all languages, with latest date of inclusion to be August 2013. Abstracts and titles that resulted from executing the search strategy were independently evaluated by two reviewers for potential eligibility and the full text versions of all potentially eligible studies were obtained. Two reviewers working independently considered the full text reports for eligibility. Disagreements were harmonized by consensus and if not possible by consensus through arbitration by a third reviewer.</p>
<p><strong>Radiosurgery in Patients with Cushing's Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force searched for comparative studies and when not possible, they included singles arms from studies that reported outcomes of interest in patients who received radiosurgery (RS). Radiosurgical techniques included mainly Gamma knife techniques (cobalt, stereotactic, leksell, linear accelerator [LINAC], proton beam). Biochemical remission and recurrence were defined by various criteria, and therefore, were also reported according to the used definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Radiotherapy in Patients with Cushing's Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force searched for comparative studies and when not possible, they included singles arms from studies that reported treatment-na&amp;iuml;ve interventions of interest. They included any form of RT, including conventional, external beam, fractioned, heavy particle and LINAC RT.

<p>Overall, analyses were underpowered to determine important independent predictors of the outcomes of interest. The quality of the evidence for recurrence and remission outcomes was low due to high risk of bias, heterogeneity, and imprecision.</p>
<p>Using a standardized form two reviewers independently extracted data from each study and later reconciled differences, if present. Reviewers determined the methodological quality of studies and collected descriptive, methodological and outcome data.</p>
<p>To measure the overall heterogeneity across the included studies, the reviewers used <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic, where <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> &amp;gt;50% suggests high heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 12.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).</p>
<p><strong>Radiosurgery in Patients with Cushing's Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</strong></p>
<p>The outcome measure was the event rate (cumulative incidence) at the end of follow up period. The 95% confidence intervals were estimated using binomial distribution. The reviewers then pooled the log transformed event rates using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models with the heterogeneity estimated from the Mantel-Haenszel model. The Altman and Bland test was used to compare the outcomes in the subgroup surgical interventions, when possible. They conducted subgroup analyses based on follow-up period, history of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use (initial/pre-treatment, follow-up/post-treatment, or both), history of receiving prior transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), gender, age groups (pediatric vs. adult), tumor size (micro- vs. macroadenoma), dural invasion (yes or no), and year of publication (pre- and post-1975).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Because all treatments carry risk, clinicians should establish a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) before administering them. </li>
    <li>Adverse side effects of medications used to treat CS (see Table 1 in the original guideline document for common side effects of specific medications) </li>
    <li>As with any transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy (TSS), potential complications include electrolyte disturbances, hemorrhage, and meningitis. Hyponatremia occurs in 5%&amp;ndash;10% of patients, usually between postoperative days 5 and 10. This complication is more common after extensive gland exploration in menstruating women. Diabetes insipidus is relatively common in the first few postoperative days but is usually transient. The Task Force recommends measuring serum sodium several times during the first 5&amp;ndash;14 days after surgery to address both possibilities, either daily or guided by the patient's intake and output. </li>
    <li>Despite the use of physiological glucocorticoid replacement, many patients suffer from glucocorticoid withdrawal after surgery. Patients should be warned that this is common and expected. Symptoms include anorexia; nausea; weight loss; and other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, flu-like myalgias and arthralgias, lethargy, and skin desquamation. Accordingly, patients usually feel worse within a few days or weeks after successful surgery. Adults may experience persistent or new-onset atypical depressive disorders, anxiety, or panic symptoms. Recovery from the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome may take 1 year or longer. </li>
    <li>Hypopituitarism is a risk with all forms of radiation. Up to two-thirds of patients develop anterior pituitary hormone deficiency after radiation therapy (RT). Additional radiation risks include optic neuropathy (1%&amp;ndash;2%) and other cranial neuropathies (2%&amp;ndash;4%) as well as a small risk of secondary neoplasia within the radiation field (most commonly meningiomas). </li>

All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest. These are reviewed before members are approved to serve on the Task Force and reviewed periodically during the development of the guideline.

<p>Those participants who do have conflicts of interest must disclose all conflicts. The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest. Most members of the Task Force have relationships with companies that make pharmaceuticals for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome (CS). The Task Force explicitly discussed the possibility of a perception of conflict and agreed that the sections on individual pharmaceuticals would be written by an individual without such a conflict; subsequent changes were approved by the entire group.</p>
