	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: The 2016 recommendations are listed below. These recommendations are consistent with the previous (2014) recommendations. Similar to the 2014 recommendations, the Update Committee advises that axillary lymph node dissection can be avoided in patients with one or two positive sentinel nodes only when conventionally fractionated whole-breast radiation therapy is planned. Clinicians should also consider this recommendation with caution in patients with large primary tumors (&amp;gt;5 cm), those with large or bulky metastatic axillary sentinel lymph nodes, and/or those with gross extranodal extension of the tumor.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Overarching Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p>How should the results of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) be used in clinical practice, and what are the potential benefits and harms associated with SNB?</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Can axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) be avoided in patients who have tumor-free (i.e., negative) findings on SNB?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em>: Clinicians should not recommend ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer who do not have nodal metastases (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Is ALND necessary for all patients with metastatic findings on SNB?</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2.1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For women with metastatic sentinel lymph nodes planning to undergo breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Clinicians should not recommend ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer who have one or two sentinel lymph node metastases will receive breast-conserving surgery with conventionally fractionated whole-breast radiotherapy (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2.2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For women with nodal metastases who are planning to undergo mastectomy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: Clinicians may offer ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer with nodal metastases found in SNB specimens who will receive mastectomy (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of SNB in special circumstances in clinical practice?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3</em>: Clinicians may offer SNB for women who have operable breast cancer who have the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><em>3.1</em>. Multicentric tumors (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate) </li>
    <li><em>3.2</em>. Ductal carcinoma in situ when mastectomy is performed (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak) </li>
    <li><em>3.3</em>. Prior breast and/or axillary surgery (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong) </li>
    <li><em>3.4</em>. Preoperative/neoadjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other Special Circumstances</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to change the 2005 recommendation that clinicians should not perform SNB for women who have early-stage breast cancer and are in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><em>4.1</em>. Large or locally advanced invasive breast cancers (tumor size T3/T4) (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak) </li>
    <li><em>4.2</em>. Inflammatory breast cancer (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak) </li>
    <li><em>4.3</em>. Ductal carcinoma in situ when breast-conserving surgery is planned (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong) </li>

<p>PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines for the period from 2012 through July 2016. The disease and intervention search terms were those used for the 2014 guideline update. An Expert Panel, formed in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO's) Conflict of Interest Management Procedures for Clinical Practice Guidelines, reviewed the identified abstracts for predefined signals that would suggest the need to change a previous recommendation. Additional information about the results of the updated literature search (Data Supplement 2 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) and 2016 search strategy string and results (Data Supplement 3 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]), as well as a discussion of ASCO's signals approach to guideline updating, are available in the 2016 Data Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) and 2016 Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), respectively. A QUORUM diagram of the updated search and the clinical questions are provided in Data Supplement 4 and Data Supplement 5, respectively.</p>

    <li>Population: women with early-stage breast cancer. </li>
    <li>For Clinical Questions 1 and 2, fully published or recent meeting presentations of English-language reports of phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or rigorously conducted systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Trials with a population of women with early breast cancer that compared sentinel node biopsy (SNB) with the standard treatment of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); this included studies comparing SNB alone with SNB plus ALND, for those patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). </li>
    <li>For special circumstances, prospective comparative cohort trials were accepted (criteria listed in Data Supplement 8 in the 2014 version of the guideline [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were: (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; and (3) published in a language other than English.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, surgery, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Committee was led by two Co-Chairs and two Steering Committee members who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Steering Committee met once by telephone, and full Update Committee corresponded through e-mail.

All members of the Update Committee participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&amp;trade;. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

The information herein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, because the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like must, must not, should, and should not indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an as-is basis and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose.

    <li>Clinicians may perform sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed by minimally invasive breast biopsy: one, when mastectomy is planned, because this precludes subsequent SNB at a second operation; two, when physical examination or imaging shows a mass lesion highly suggestive of invasive cancer; or three, the area of DCIS by imaging is large (&amp;ge;5 cm). SNB may be offered before or after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NACT), but the procedure seems less accurate after NACT. </li>

    <field fieldid="131" ordby="1010" id="436" name="Description of Implementation Strategy" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed to be implemented in a variety of health settings. Barriers to implementation and application of the guideline recommendations include the need to increase awareness among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors and also the need to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network and other ASCO communications. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
<p>Given the multidisciplinary care discussed in this guideline and the importance of sharing the update with the many relevant stakeholders, it is suggested that community oncologists, surgical oncologists, and radiation oncologists as well as patient navigators and academic, community, and hospital-based cancer centers consider these guidelines. In addition, given that the majority of US cancer programs have cancer tumor boards or continuing medical education activities that include the many clinicians treating breast cancer, the Panel encourages those programs to distribute and stimulate discussion of this guideline update. In expanding outreach of ASCO guidelines through the national tumor board system, the Panel hopes to speed the sharing of this update as well as to stimulate coordinated multidisciplinary care decisions among medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists as well as patients, their advocates, and cancer program leaders. The American College of Surgeons, which accredits most U.S. cancer programs, has included review of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer as quality measures in the past few years. Discussion of including ASCO guidelines and updates as part of this process would further increase the review and discussion of ASCO guidelines and likely speed the uptake of newly evaluated studies and guideline updates that can improve the quality of cancer care for patients.</p>
