	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN): </span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In addition to evidence, AAN guidelines incorporate several consensus-based factors into constructing practice recommendations. The following four premise types are part of that process:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Evidence from the systematic review </li>
        <li>Strong evidence from related conditions </li>
        <li>Axiomatic principles of care </li>
        <li>Inferences made from one or more statements in the rationale </li>
    </ul>

    <li>The above-listed premise types are presented as rationales before each recommendation statement. The premises contribute to the strength of those recommendation statements. </li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations for Assessing for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A1</strong></p>
<p>For patients for whom the patient or a close contact voices concern about memory or impaired cognition, clinicians should assess for MCI and not assume the concerns are related to normal aging (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A2</strong></p>
<p>When performing a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, clinicians should not rely on historical report of subjective memory concerns alone when assessing for cognitive impairment (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A3</strong></p>
<p>For patients for whom screening or assessing for MCI is appropriate, clinicians should use validated assessment tools to assess for cognitive impairment (<strong>Level B</strong>). For patients who test positive for MCI, clinicians should perform a more formal clinical assessment for diagnosis of MCI (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A4</strong></p>
<p>For patients with MCI, clinicians should assess for the presence of functional impairment related to cognition before giving a diagnosis of dementia (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A5</strong></p>
<p>For patients suspected to have MCI, clinicians who lack the necessary experience should refer these patients to a specialist with experience in cognition (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A6</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians should perform a medical evaluation for MCI risk factors that are potentially modifiable (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A7a</strong></p>
<p>For patients and families asking about biomarkers in MCI, clinicians should counsel that there are no accepted biomarkers available at this time (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A7b</strong></p>
<p>For interested patients, clinicians may discuss the option of biomarker research or refer patients, or both, if feasible, to centers or organizations that can connect patients to this research (e.g., subspecialty centers, Trial Match, ClinicalTrials.gov) (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation A8</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians should perform serial assessments over time to monitor for changes in cognitive status (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations for Management of MCI</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B1</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians should wean patients from medications that can contribute to cognitive impairment (where feasible and medically appropriate) and treat modifiable risk factors that may be contributing (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B2</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians should counsel the patients and families that there are no pharmacologic or dietary agents currently shown to have symptomatic cognitive benefit in MCI and that no medications are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for this purpose (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B3a</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians may choose not to offer cholinesterase inhibitors (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B3b</strong></p>
<p>If clinicians choose to offer cholinesterase inhibitors, they must first discuss with patients the fact that this is an off-label prescription not currently backed by empirical evidence (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B4</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI who are interested in pharmacologic treatment, clinicians may inform these patients of centers or organizations that can connect patients to clinical trials (e.g., subspecialty centers, Trial Match, ClinicalTrials.gov) (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B5</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians should recommend regular exercise (twice/week) as part of an overall approach to management (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B6</strong></p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with MCI, clinicians should discuss diagnosis and uncertainties regarding prognosis. Clinicians should counsel patients and families to discuss long-term planning topics such as advance directives, driving safety, finances, and estate planning (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B7</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess for behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI and treat with both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches when indicated (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation B8</strong></p>
<p>In patients with MCI, clinicians may recommend cognitive interventions (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class I</span></p>
<p>A statistical, population-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class II</span></p>
<p>A statistical, non-referral-clinic-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class III</span></p>
<p>A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><em>Prognostic Accuracy Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class I</span></p>
<p>A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class II</span></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class III</span></p>
<p>A case-control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><em>Therapeutic Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class I</span></p>
<p>A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>No more than 2 primary outcomes specified </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for dropouts (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot;>
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or noninferiority </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose, and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective) </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the study results is based on a per-protocol analysis that accounts for dropouts or crossovers </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For crossover trials, both period and carryover effects examined and statistical adjustments performed, if appropriate </li>
</ol>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class II</span></p>
<p>A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&amp;ndash;e above (see Class I) or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&amp;ndash;e above (see Class I). (Alternatively, a randomized crossover trial missing 1 of the following 2 characteristics: period and carryover effects described or baseline characteristics of treatment order groups presented.) All relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups, or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class III</span></p>
<p>All other controlled trials (including studies with external controls such as well-defined natural history controls). (Alternatively, a crossover trial missing both of the following 2 criteria: period and carryover effects described or baseline characteristics of treatment order groups presented.) A description of major confounding differences between treatment groups that could affect outcome.** Outcome assessment is masked, objective, or performed by someone who is not a member of the treatment team.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies that (1) did not include patients with the disease, (2) did not include patients receiving different interventions, (3) had undefined or unaccepted interventions or outcomes measures, or (4) had no measures of effectiveness or statistical precision presented or calculable.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Note that numbers 1&amp;ndash;3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb should. Should recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb may or might. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The guideline panel included articles in humans related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND) under the headings of prevalence, prognosis, treatment (both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic). The panel excluded pharmacologic treatment trials with fewer than 50 participants. The complete search strategy is presented in appendix e-3 in the full guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The panel engaged a medical librarian to search the MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from January 2000 to December 2008. An updated literature search was completed from January 2008 to April 2014. An additional updated search was performed in December 2015 to include prevalence, prognosis, and cognitive therapy articles. Two panel members working independently of each other reviewed each of the 11,530 abstracts retrieved for basic inclusion criteria: (1) article was relevant to at least one of the clinical questions; (2) article described MCI, cognition disorders, or memory disorders, unrelated to dementia; (3) study population was greater than or equal to 50 to reduce the likelihood of spurious results due to small samples; (4) article was not a single-patient case report, review, or editorial. Of the 11,530 abstracts reviewed, the panelists identified 315 as pertinent, for which they obtained and reviewed the full-text articles.</p>
<p>For the prevalence and prognosis questions, the guideline panel excluded from analysis articles that reanalyzed cohorts (substudies) or assessed secondary outcomes of a parent treatment study. For the treatment question, the guideline authors excluded articles that assessed mixed populations (e.g., persons with MCI or dementia). Also excluded were pharmacologic treatment studies totaling fewer than 50 participants and cognitive intervention studies lacking control groups and totaling fewer than 50 participants. Class III studies are discussed in the guideline text only when no Class I or Class II studies were identified. Class IV studies were excluded from consideration because of their high risk of bias. </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2008, after reviewing potential members' conflict of interest statements and curriculum vitae, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to develop this guideline. The original panel consisted of 6 neurologists, 1 geriatric psychiatrist, 1 neuropsychologist, 1 geriatrician, and 1 AAN staff member. Additional assistance was later provided by 2 guideline methodology specialists and another guideline subcommittee member. The panel determined at project initiation that the literature on &quot;biomarkers&quot; to predict progression to Alzheimer disease (AD) is changing rapidly and should be the subject of a future guideline or systematic review. This view was reaffirmed in 2016. The panel developed research questions in PICO format: patient, intervention, comparison, outcome.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The guideline panel used a modified form of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to develop conclusions (see appendix e-6 in the full guideline for evidence synthesis tables) and a modified Delphi process to achieve consensus regarding recommendations. In accordance with the 2011 guideline manual, recommendations were based not only on the evidence in the systematic review, but also on strong related evidence, established principles of care, and inferences. The level of obligation for each recommendation was based on the strength of these premises and the risk&amp;ndash;benefit ratio of following the recommendation, with adjustments based on importance of outcomes, variation in patient preferences, feasibility/availability, and patient costs. Consensus was determined by a modified Delphi voting process in accordance with prespecified rules. Appendix e-7 in the full guideline delineates the steps and rules for formulating recommendations, and appendix e-8 in the full guideline presents the rationale of factors considered during recommendation development.</p></div>"/>

Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb may or might. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. The AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at aan.com. For complete information on this process, access the 2004 AAN process manual.</p>
