	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>The participants formulated clinically pertinent focused statements related to the detection and management of dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and framed each statement in terms of population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Literature Search</span></strong> </p>
<p>A systematic literature search of multiple bibliographic databases (EMBASE 1980 to 2013 Week 38; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 1898 to August 2013; Ovid MEDLINE, 1946 to present, in-process and other non-indexed citations, and daily update September 24, 2013) was performed for each focused statement by the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Additional searches from major gastroenterology scientific meetings (e.g., Digestive Disease Week, American College of Gastroenterology, United European Gastroenterology Week) for 2009-2013 and of reference lists from selected articles were also performed (see the figure in the original guideline document). The search strategy keywords were framed for the PICO-formatted focused clinical statements (see Appendix 3 in original guideline document). The search was limited to human studies without any language restriction. Two reviewers performed the initial title and abstract review, review of full-text articles for inclusion, and data extraction independently. Following full text review and article selection, a third person adjudicated any discrepancies.</p>
<p>By using pre-specified criteria, the guideline group excluded abstracts/articles when (1) the population did not include colonic inflammatory bowel disease; (2) the intervention or comparator did not include sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for the detection, diagnosis or management of colorectal neoplasia, dysplasia or early cancer; (3) the outcome did not include colorectal neoplasia, dysplasia or cancer-related detection, incidence or mortality; (4) the article type was a case report or series; (5) the article contained duplicate data; (6) the article had relevant missing data that could not be obtained despite attempts to contact corresponding authors; (7) the author had articles on the topic retracted from the literature; and (8) the studies included data from the fiberoptic endoscope era (predating 1990).</p></div>"/>

<p>Risk of bias for individual studies was assessed independently by two reviewers with the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for observational diagnostic studies and a modified Jadad score (one point added if allocation was concealed) for randomized trials; a third person adjudicated any discrepancies. The quality of the evidence for each statement was rated by two reviewers independently as very low quality, low quality, moderate quality, and high quality based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology; disagreements were resolved by discussion (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>
<p>Meta-analyses were performed when multiple studies relevant to a focused question were found and could be appropriately pooled. The guideline group used a fixed effect model, except in cases of significant heterogeneity when it used a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. The guideline group used the Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic to assess heterogeneity. Significant heterogeneity was defined as a <em>P</em> &amp;lt;.10 for the Cochran Q test or I<sup>2</sup> statistic &amp;gt;50%. The guideline group performed the data analysis by using the Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) statistical package.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development Panel</span></strong></p>
<p>A 5-member executive committee of content experts, general gastroenterologists, and methodologists oversaw the development process. The executive committee selected a multidisciplinary panel to represent a wide spectrum of stakeholders in the diagnosis and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to provide international viewpoints. This 21-member panel included IBD experts, general gastroenterologists, advanced endoscopists, methodologists, pathologists, a surgeon, an advanced practice IBD nurse, and a patient representative from an IBD non-profit organization. Representation from a wide spectrum of stakeholders and attitudes toward the detection and management of dysplasia in IBD was emphasized. An additional 8 non-voting physicians, chosen for their expertise in areas such as endoscopic techniques or guideline dissemination/ implementation, attended the meeting to provide information as requested by voting panelists. The list of participants is provided in Appendix 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Process for Development of Recommendations</span> </strong></p>
<p>The guideline group deployed an online consensus platform to facilitate most aspects of the consensus process. The panel received evidence reports for each statement. Two rounds of voting on level of agreement with the statements were conducted by using the online platform prior to a face-to-face meeting of all participants to determine consensus on the recommendations. Modifications to the wording of the statements were made as needed in response to the participants' comments after each round of voting. </p>
<p>The guideline group held a one and a half-day consensus conference in March 2014, where data were presented, wording of the statements was discussed and finalized, and participants voted on their level of agreement by using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). They defined the criterion for accepting a statement as a recommendation as &amp;ge;80% of participants voting 4 (agree) or 5 (strongly agree). If a panel member was absent or did not vote at the time of a vote, the denominator of panelists who were present and voted was used. Once a recommendation was accepted, panelists voted on whether to label the recommendation as strong or conditional according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Wording of recommendations was based on the strength of recommendation: <em>recommend </em>was used for strong recommendations, and <em>suggest </em>was used for conditional recommendations. Voting percentages for individual statements could vary based on the number of voting members in attendance at the time of voting on the statement. The executive committee drafted the manuscript, which was then reviewed by the voting panel members and also by the 8 non-voting physicians with expertise in areas including IBD and advanced endoscopic imaging techniques who had attended the guideline meeting to provide information to panelists. The manuscript was revised based on these comments and approved by the participants. Additional revisions for clarity and description were made in response to comments from the peer review process.</p></div>"/>

<p>Widespread implementation of high-quality endoscopic surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will require a variety of initiatives, which will be discussed in a separate publication. Resources will be needed to train endoscopists in endoscopic surveillance and recognition of visible dysplasia with both white-light endoscopy and chromoendoscopy. These may include training courses, photographic atlases, and video repositories. Quality metrics and methods to document acceptable performance quality also should be developed. In addition, techniques such as chromoendoscopy should be standardized to allow implementation in endoscopy units, and endoscopic resection techniques for nonpolypoid lesions should be taught and disseminated. Development of a procedure code for chromoendoscopy and reimbursement for the increased time and intensity required for chromoendoscopy would increase implementation, at least in the United States.</p></div>"/>
