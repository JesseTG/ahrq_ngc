	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>General Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should a person with diabetes be screened for foot ulcer risk?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>To identify a person with diabetes at risk for foot ulceration, examine the feet annually to seek evidence for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease. (<strong>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] strength of recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence: Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What should an at-risk person with diabetes be screened for?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>In a person with diabetes who has peripheral neuropathy, screen for a history of foot ulceration or lower-extremity amputation, peripheral artery disease, foot deformity, pre-ulcerative signs on the foot, poor foot hygiene, and ill-fitting or inadequate footwear. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is the treatment of a pre-ulcerative sign on the foot effective in preventing a foot ulcer in an at-risk patient with diabetes?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>Treat any pre-ulcerative sign on the foot of a patient with diabetes. This includes removing callus, protecting blisters and draining when necessary, treating ingrown or thickened toe nails, treating hemorrhage when necessary and prescribing antifungal treatment for fungal infections. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What should an at-risk patient with diabetes avoid when walking at home or outside?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>To protect their feet, instruct an at-risk patient with diabetes not to walk barefoot, in socks only, or in thin-soled standard slippers, whether at home or when outside. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What self-management interventions should a patient perform on a regular basis?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Instruct an at-risk patient with diabetes to daily inspect their feet and the inside of their shoes, daily wash their feet (with careful drying particularly between the toes), avoid using chemical agents or plasters to remove callus or corns, use emollients to lubricate dry skin and cut toe nails straight across. (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is footwear effective in preventing a first or recurrent non-plantar foot ulcer in an at-risk patient with diabetes?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>Instruct an at-risk patient with diabetes to wear properly fitting footwear to prevent a first foot ulcer, either plantar or non-plantar, or a recurrent non-plantar foot ulcer. When a foot deformity or a pre-ulcerative sign is present, consider prescribing therapeutic shoes, custom-made insoles or toe orthosis. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is therapeutic footwear effective in preventing a recurrent plantar foot ulcer in at-risk patients with diabetes?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>
    <li>To prevent a recurrent plantar foot ulcer in an at-risk patient with diabetes, prescribe therapeutic footwear that has a demonstrated plantar pressure relieving effect during walking (i.e., 30% relief compared with plantar pressure in standard of care therapeutic footwear) and encourage the patient to wear this footwear. (<strong>Strong; Moderate</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is patient education effective in preventing a first foot ulcer in an at-risk patient?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;8&quot;>
    <li>To prevent a first foot ulcer in an at-risk patient with diabetes, provide education aimed at improving foot care knowledge and behavior, as well as encouraging the patient to adhere to this foot care advice. (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is integrated foot care effective in preventing recurrent foot ulcers in at-risk patients with diabetes?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>To prevent a recurrent foot ulcer in an at-risk patient with diabetes, provide integrated foot care, which includes professional foot treatment, adequate footwear and education. This should be repeated or re-evaluated once every 1 to 3 months as necessary. (<strong>Strong; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is self-management of foot health effective in preventing a first or recurrent foot ulcer in at-risk patients with diabetes?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>
    <li>Instruct a high-risk patient with diabetes to monitor foot skin temperatures at home to prevent a first or recurrent plantar foot ulcer. This aims at identifying the early signs of inflammation, followed by action taken by the patient and care provider to resolve the cause of inflammation. (<strong>Weak; Moderate</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Are surgical interventions effective in preventing a foot ulcer in at-risk patients?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;11&quot;>
    <li>Consider digital flexor tenotomy to prevent a toe ulcer when conservative treatment fails in a high-risk patient with diabetes, hammertoes and either a pre-ulcerative sign or an ulcer on the distal toe. (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider Achilles tendon lengthening, joint arthroplasty, single or pan metatarsal head resection or osteotomy to prevent a recurrent foot ulcer when conservative treatment fails in a high-risk patient with diabetes and a plantar forefoot ulcer. (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>) </li>
    <li>Do not use a nerve decompression procedure in an effort to prevent a foot ulcer in an at-risk patient with diabetes, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (<strong>Weak; Low</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations in the guidance were formulated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence when writing a clinical guideline. The authors assessed the quality of evidence on the risk of bias of included studies, effect sizes, and expert opinion, and rated the quality of evidence as 'high,' 'moderate' or 'low.' They assessed the strength of each recommendation as 'strong' or 'weak,' based on the quality of evidence, balance between benefits and harm, patient values and preferences, and costs (resource utilization). The rationale behind each recommendation is described in the original guideline document. See the <a href=&quot;http://gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Web site&quot;>GRADE Web site</a> for more information.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The systematic review for this guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic review was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (CRD42014012964).</p>
<p>The population of interest for the systematic review was persons with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus who are at risk for foot ulceration. In accordance with the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) definition, 'at-risk' was defined as 'presence of peripheral neuropathy, with or without a foot deformity or peripheral artery disease, or a history of foot ulcer(s) or amputation of (a part of) the foot or leg'. Primary outcomes were first diabetic foot ulcer and recurrent diabetic foot ulcer. A diabetic foot ulcer was defined as a 'full thickness lesion of the skin distal to the malleoli in a person with diabetes mellitus'. 'First ulcer' was the first-ever recorded diabetic foot ulcer in a patient. 'Recurrent ulcer' was any foot ulcer after successful healing of a previous one, irrespective of which foot or at what location on the foot the ulcer recurred. The systematic review authors have reported first and recurrent ulcer separately because patients with a previous ulcer are considered at higher risk compared with those without, and consequently, these patients require more preventative foot care. If a study included both patients with and without a previous ulcer and results were not presented separately for first and recurrent ulcers, the primary outcome was 'first/recurrent ulcer'.</p>
<p>Original research studies were included that reported on interventions that had the goal to prevent a first or recurrent foot ulcer in the population of interest. The reviewers defined three groups of interventions <em>a priori</em> and systematically reviewed the literature for each group separately in order to structure the literature search and to distribute assignments among reviewers.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Care: interventions aimed at improvements in care, such as with podiatry, chiropody, multidisciplinary care, integrated foot care, screening interventions to detect and treat patients at risk for diabetic foot ulceration, or interventions aimed at education of health care professionals. </li>
    <li>Self-management: interventions aimed at the self-management of patients, such as patient education, home monitoring of foot status, or lifestyle interventions. </li>
    <li>Medical: generally hospital-based interventions, such as surgery and therapeutic footwear. </li>
</ol>
<p>The reviewers excluded studies on healthy subjects, on persons with diseases other than diabetes or on persons with diabetes who are not at risk for foot ulceration. They only included studies of persons with active ulcers when these studies reported outcomes on ulcer recurrence after healing of the active ulcer. They excluded studies on interventions with surrogate outcomes related to ulcer prevention, for example, studies with results on foot care behavior, knowledge, and awareness, quality of life, pre-ulcerative lesions, plantar pressure or amputation only. They included systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case&amp;ndash;control studies, cohort studies, (controlled) before-and-after studies, interrupted time series, prospective and retrospective non-controlled studies, cross-sectional studies and case series. They excluded case reports.</p>
<p>Before performing the systematic search of the literature, reviewers created validation sets of approximately 20 publications for each group of interventions. Each publication in the sets had to be identified in the literature search. The validation set was created by first including key publications known to the authors that fit the scope of this systematic review. Secondly, reference lists in these publications and references to these publications were checked and key publications were included in the validation set. Finally, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) (<a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;WHO-ICTRP Web site&quot;>http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx</a>) was searched using the search string (Diabet* AND ulcer* OR diabet* AND reulcer* OR diabet* AND amput). The reviewers screened identified trials for relevance in relation to the scope of the systematic review and searched trial numbers and authors of relevant trials in PubMed to identify publications to be added to the validation set.</p>
<p>The literature search was performed on 24 July 2014, covered publications in all languages and was not restricted by date. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) via Ovid SP, Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp;amp; Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strings (see online Appendix 1&amp;ndash;4 of the systematic review) for each database were prepared with the help of a clinical librarian.</p>
<p>For each of the three groups of interventions, two members of the working group independently reviewed publications by title and abstract for eligibility to be included in the analysis, based on four criteria: population; study design; outcomes; and intervention. Cohen's kappa was calculated for agreement between reviewers. Reviewers discussed and reached consensus on any disagreement on inclusion of publications. Publications identified in more than one intervention group were discussed between all reviewers and further analysed within the intervention group for which the study best fitted. Subsequently, the same two reviewers independently assessed full-paper copies of included publications on the same four criteria for final eligibility. Conference proceedings, if included after assessment of title and abstract, were used to search for full-paper publications. If no full-paper copy of the study was found, the authors were contacted for more information, to assess for any possible publication bias or selective reporting of results. Tracking of references of included publications was not performed.</p>
<p>To further assess for possible publication bias or selective reporting of results, the WHO-ICTRP trial registry (<a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;WHO-ICTRP Web site&quot;>http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx</a>) was searched on 30 July 2014. The Clinicaltrials.gov registry was also searched separately (<a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/&quot; title=&quot;Clinicaltrials.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://clinicaltrials.gov</a>) on 31 July 2014 (see online Appendix 5 of the systematic review). Two reviewers independently assessed identified trials for eligibility based on three criteria: patient group; outcomes; and intervention. Reviewers retrieved the status of eligible trials ('completed', 'ongoing' or 'not yet started') from the databases. Cohen's kappa was calculated for agreement. Reviewers solved disagreement concerning eligibility by discussion, until consensus was reached. Any relevant publication related to a completed trial was searched for in the same databases as for the literature search. If no publications were identified, the principal investigator of the trial was contacted for more information.</p></div>"/>

The same two reviewers per intervention group independently assessed included publications with a controlled study design for methodological quality (i.e., risk of bias), using scoring sheets developed by the Dutch Cochrane Centre (<a href=&quot;http://www.cochrane.nl&quot; title=&quot;Cochrane Netherlands Web site&quot;>www.cochrane.nl</a>). Reviewers resolved disagreement regarding risk of bias by discussion, until consensus was reached. The SIGN level of evidence was determined for each publication. Level 1 refers to randomized controlled trials and Level 2 refers to case&amp;ndash;control, cohort, controlled before-and-after designs or interrupted time series. Risk of bias was scored for each study as ++ (very low risk of bias), + (low risk of bias) or &amp;ndash; (high risk of bias). Data were extracted from each included publication with a controlled study design and summarized in the evidence table. This table included patient and study characteristics, characteristics of the intervention and control conditions and primary and secondary outcomes. One of the reviewers extracted the data; the other reviewer checked this for content and presentation. All members of the working group thoroughly discussed the evidence table. Reviewers did not participate in the assessment, data extraction and discussion of publications of which they were a co-author, to prevent any conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Finally, the two reviewers per group drew conclusions for each intervention based on the strength of the available evidence. All members of the working group discussed these conclusions, until consensus was reached.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Foot ulcers are a major complication of diabetes mellitus, with high morbidity, mortality and costs. Yearly incidence is estimated to be around 2%, but this increases substantially when patients successfully heal from a foot ulcer, with reported recurrence rates between 30% and 40% in the first year. Prevention of these ulcers is of paramount importance to reduce the patient and economic burden. </li>
    <li>The aim of more frequent screening is early identification of factors that can increase the chances of developing a foot ulcer, followed by providing appropriate preventative foot care. For example, early diagnosis and treatment of pre-ulcerative signs on the foot may prevent foot ulcers, as well as more severe complications such as infection and hospitalization. </li>

    <li>Adherence to self-management was an important factor in the conducted randomized controlled trials, and patients, in particular those who have not had a foot ulcer, may find the requirement for daily assessment a burden. False-positive and false-negative outcomes of temperature measurements may unnecessarily concern or stress patients and affect their confidence in this approach. </li>
    <li>Possible complications and side effects of surgical offloading techniques include post-operative infection, new deformities, gait problems and transfer ulcers. Clinicians should carefully discuss possible adverse effects of the surgery with the patient. </li>
    <li>The possible benefits of digital flexor tenotomy likely outweigh the harm, as few complications have been reported. Possible adverse effects of the surgery, although minimal, should be discussed with the patient. </li>
