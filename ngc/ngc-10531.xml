	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 10</strong></p>
<p>For adults and children with SCD-related acute pain, what are the most effective acute pain management strategies (including types of analgesics, dose and administration protocols, and other interventions such as inhaled nitrous oxide, oxygen, and transfusion)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations labeled &quot;consensus&quot; in this section were based on recommendations developed by the American Pain Society (APS) or on panel expertise. The remaining recommendations are based on the evidence review conducted by the methodology team. These recommendations are intended to be for all settings where patients present with VOC.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and pain
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>When indicated, initiate diagnostic evaluation of causes of pain other than a VOC while beginning to treat pain. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Determine characteristics, associated symptoms, location, and intensity of pain based on patient self-report and observation. If the VOC pain is atypical, investigate other possible etiologies of pain. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
        <li>Rapidly assess the patient's recent analgesic use (opioid and nonopioid). (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
        <li>Rapidly initiate analgesic therapy within 30 minutes of triage or within 60 minutes of registration. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
        <li>Base analgesic selection on pain assessment, associated symptoms, outpatient analgesic use, patient knowledge of effective agents and doses, and past experience with side effects. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Use an individualized prescribing and monitoring protocol (written by the patient's SCD provider) or an SCD-specific protocol whenever possible (see Exhibit 7 in the original guideline document) to promote rapid, effective, and safe analgesic management and resolution of the VOC. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC associated with mild to moderate pain who report relief with NSAIDS in the absence of contraindications to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), continue treatment with NSAIDs. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC associated with severe pain, rapidly initiate treatment with parenteral opioids. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC associated with severe pain
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Calculate the parenteral (intravenous [IV] or subcutaneous) opioid dose based on total daily short-acting opioid dose currently being taken at home to manage the VOC. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
        <li>Administer parenteral opioids using the subcutaneous route when IV access is difficult. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
        <li>Reassess pain and re-administer opioids if necessary for continued severe pain every 15 to 30 minutes until pain is under control per patient report. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
        <li>Maintain or consider escalation of the dose by 25 percent until pain is controlled. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
        <li>Reassess after each dose for pain relief and side effects. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
        <li>Initiate around-the-clock opioid administration by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or frequently scheduled doses versus &quot;as requested&quot; (PRN) administration. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If ordering around-the-clock, continuous infusion of opioids via the PCA, carefully consider whether there is a need to withhold long-acting oral opioids to prevent over-sedation. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>If demand dosing only is ordered via the PCA, continue use of long-acting oral opioids. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
        <li>At discharge, evaluate inpatient analgesic requirements, wean parenteral opioids prior to conversion to oral opioids, and adjust home dose of long- and short-acting opioid prescriptions to prevent opioid withdrawal after discharge. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC, do not use meperidine unless it is the only effective opioid for an individual patient. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>In adults and children with a VOC, administer oral NSAIDs as an adjuvant analgesic in the absence of contraindications. (<strong>Consensus&amp;mdash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>In adults and children with a VOC who require antihistamines for itching secondary to opioid administration, prescribe agents orally, and do not re-administer with each dose of opioid in the acute VOC management phase. Re-administer every 4 to 6 hours if needed. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>To reduce the risk of acute chest syndrome in adults and children hospitalized for a VOC
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Encourage use of incentive spirometry while awake. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
        <li>Encourage ambulation and activity as soon as possible. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In adults and children with VOC, use adjunctive nonpharmacologic approaches to treat pain such as local heat application and distraction. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>In euvolemic adults and children with SCD and a VOC who are unable to drink fluids, provide IV hydration at no more than maintenance rate to avoid over-hydration. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>In adults and children with SCD and a VOC being treated with opioids, monitor for excessive sedation by measuring sedation with an objective measurement sedation scale and oxygenation levels. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Gradually titrate down parenteral opioids as VOC resolves. (<strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>

Official Journal of the American Thoracic Society.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as &quot;consensus.&quot; Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with SCD presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>General Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Due to the comprehensive scope of the guidelines, the search strategies for the systematic reviews were designed to have high sensitivity and low specificity; hence, the strategies were often derived from population and condition terms (e.g., people with sickle cell disease [SCD] who have priapism) and not restricted or combined with outcome or intervention terms. To be inclusive of the available literature in the field, searches included randomized trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Case reports and small case series were included only when outcomes involved harm (e.g., the adverse effects of hydroxyurea) or when rare complications were expected to be reported.</p>
<p>Literature searches involved multiple databases (e.g., Medline&amp;reg; In-Process &amp;amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE&amp;reg;, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL&amp;reg;], TOXLINE&amp;reg;, and Scopus) and used controlled vocabulary (prespecified) terms supplemented with keywords to define concept areas.</p>
<p>An updated search was performed to span the time from June 1, 2010 through July 11, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline-specific Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive study of several databases was conducted, and all human studies in English published from 1970 to July 2010 that addressed each Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study Design (PICOS) question were identified. When the literature search found insufficient evidence on a topic (e.g., vaso-occlusive crisis), these topics were supplemented with recommendations derived from other published guidelines by professional organizations, which were based on systematic reviews of broader population groups; these recommendations are labeled &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted.&quot; In the instances of fever, acute anemia, and multisystem organ failure (MSOF), a literature search was not conducted, so the panel relied on their cumulative expertise and knowledge to make recommendations; these recommendations are labeled &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Methodologists developed evidence tables to summarize individual study findings and present the quality of evidence (i.e., confidence in the estimates of effect). The tables included descriptions of study population, sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes, interventions, and outcomes. Additional methodological details are discussed in each evidence table, including the search question, search strategy, study selection process, and list of excluded studies (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Framework</strong></p>
<p>The methodology team used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to grade the quality of evidence, and, in concert with the panel, determine the strength of recommendations. The GRADE framework is accepted by more than 75 national and international organizations (see exhibit 3 in the original guideline document). It provides the advantages of: (a) separately judging the quality of supporting evidence and strength of recommendations, and (b) incorporating factors other than evidence in decisionmaking (e.g., the balance of benefits and harms; the perceived values and preferences of those with SCD; resources; and clinical and social context). GRADE emphasizes the use of patient-important outcomes (i.e., outcomes that affect the way patients feel, function, or survive) over laboratory and physiologic outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Determining Evidence Quality</strong></p>
<p>In the GRADE framework, the quality of evidence (in this case, the body of evidence) is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The quality of evidence derived from randomized trials starts as &quot;high,&quot; and the quality of evidence derived from observational studies starts as &quot;low.&quot; The quality of evidence can then be lowered due to methodological limitations in individual studies (risk of bias), inconsistency across studies (heterogeneity), indirectness (the extent to which the evidence fails to apply to the specific clinical question in terms of the patients, interventions, or outcomes), imprecision (typically due to a small number of events or wide confidence intervals), and the presence of publication and reporting biases. Conversely, the quality of evidence can be upgraded in certain situations such as when the treatment effect is large or a dose-response relationship is evident.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel and methodology team identified existing systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines that were relevant to the topics of this guideline, even though they were not necessarily specific to people with SCD. If the methodological quality of these resources was found to be appropriate by the methodology team, they were used. Using this external evidence was considered helpful because well-conducted systematic reviews made the process of identifying relevant studies more feasible. In addition, using existing guidelines developed by professional organizations enabled the panel to develop more comprehensive recommendations that addressed specific aspects of care in individuals with SCD. Usually, this external evidence was derived from studies in non-sickle cell patient cohorts because it was felt that they offered more precise and useful inferences than evidence derived from sickle cell patient studies. For example, comparative evidence in the area of pain management in people with SCD was sparse. In this situation, pain management guidelines from individuals with other pain-related conditions proved to be helpful.</p>
<p>The methodology team used the AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Recent well-conducted systematic reviews were identified that addressed hydroxyurea therapy in pediatric and adult patients. The expert panel and methodology team appraised these reviews and conducted additional searches to update the existing systematic review through May 2010 to find evidence for the benefits, harms, and barriers of using hydroxyurea. Regarding the management of children with SCD complications, the panel also used recent evidence that had been systematically reviewed.</p>
<p>Existing clinical practice guidelines were considered acceptable if they had prespecified clinical questions, were developed after a comprehensive literature search, had explicit and clear criteria for the inclusion of evidence, and included recommendations that were explicitly linked to the quality of supporting evidence. The expert panel and methodology team used relevant recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) &quot;Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use,&quot; and the American Pain Society's &quot;Guideline for the Management of Acute and Chronic Pain in Sickle-Cell Disease,&quot; and &quot;Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Chronic Opioid Therapy in Chronic Noncancer Pain.&quot;</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>These guidelines were developed by an expert panel composed of health care professionals with expertise in family medicine, general internal medicine, adult and pediatric hematology, psychiatry, transfusion medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency department nursing, and evidence-based medicine. Panel members were selected by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Process and Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel first convened in the spring of 2009 to establish the vision and purpose of the panel, discuss the process and schedule for producing the guidelines, and determine the critical areas to be addressed. Prior to this meeting, the expert panel participated in a conference call to introduce the panel's work and discuss the overarching questions that should be answered by the guidelines. Before beginning the writing of the guidelines report, the expert panel divided its work into sections dealing with preventive care or health maintenance, recognition and management of acute sickle-cell disease (SCD)-related complications, recognition and management of chronic SCD-related complications, and the two most broadly assessed and available disease-modifying therapies for SCD, hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusions.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the methodology team and the supporting evidence center, the panel then developed key questions and literature search terms to identify evidence. The field of SCD has a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or large prospective cohort studies to guide clinical decisionmaking; therefore, few of the recommendations in this document are based on this highest quality evidence. For common health issues, the panel included the evidence-based recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as well as vetted recommendations of other groups. These recommendations include the SCD reproductive-related recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the immunization recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the acute and chronic pain management recommendations of the American Pain Society (APS). These recommendations are denoted as &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted.&quot;</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to provide practical guidance for common problems that may lie outside of the panel's evidence reviews or available science, in many areas the published evidence was supplemented by the expertise of the panel members, who have many years of experience in managing and studying individuals with SCD. Recommendations based on the opinions of the expert panel members are labeled as &quot;Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise.&quot; Each is clearly labeled with the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence available to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Determining the Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework rates the strength of recommendations as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak.&quot; However, the panel modified the GRADE system and used a third category&amp;mdash;moderate&amp;mdash;when they determined that patients would be better off if they followed a recommendation, despite there being some level of uncertainty about the magnitude of benefit of the intervention or the relative net benefit of alternative courses of action. The panel intends for these moderate-strength recommendations to be used to populate protocols of care and provide a guideline based on the best available evidence. The panel does not intend for weak- or moderate-strength recommendations to generate quality-of-care indicators or accountability measures or affect insurance reimbursement. Variation in care in the areas of weak- or moderate-strength recommendations may be acceptable, particularly in ways that reflect patient values and preferences. Conversely, strong recommendations represent areas in which there is confidence in the evidence supporting net benefit, and the recommendations likely apply to most individuals with sickle cell anemia.

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as &quot;consensus.&quot; Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with sickle cell disease [SCD] presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&amp;ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The purpose of the &quot;Evidence-Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease: Expert Panel Report (EPR), 2014&quot; is to synthesize the available scientific evidence on sickle cell disease and offer guidance to busy primary care clinicians. Readers of this report should remember that this document is intended to provide guidance for management, not to be rigidly prescriptive. The panel recognizes that the responsible clinician's judgment regarding the management of patients remains paramount. Therefore, the Expert Panel Report is a tool to be adopted and implemented in local and individual settings, and to provide an opportunity for shared decisionmaking in which providers and patients are both fully engaged.</p></div>"/>
