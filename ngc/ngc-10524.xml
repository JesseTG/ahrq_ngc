<p><em><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</strong></em>: In 2014, ASCO performed a focused update of the 2010 guideline on adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive breast cancer to reflect emerging data on duration of tamoxifen treatment. The updated recommendations are presented below, followed by the recommendations from the 2010 guideline that remain unchanged.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2014 Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question I</strong></p>
<p><em>Which adjuvant endocrine treatments should be offered to women with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive breast cancer who are pre- or perimenopausal? What is the appropriate duration?</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation I</span>. Women diagnosed with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive breast cancer who are pre- or perimenopausal should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy with:</p>
<p>Recommendation IA. Tamoxifen for an initial duration of 5 years (supported by 2010 evidence)</p>
<p>Recommendation IB. After 5 years, women should receive additional therapy based on menopausal status.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation IB1. If women are pre- or perimenopausal, or if menopausal status is unknown or cannot be determined, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years.&amp;nbsp;(Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2013 evidence), see the Literature Review section of the focused update document. </li>
    <li>Recommendation IB2. If women have become definitively postmenopausal, they should be offered the choice of continuing tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or switching to up to 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor (AI), for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality for tamoxifen: High; Evidence quality for AI: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2010 and 2013 evidence) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical Question II</strong></p>
<p><em>Which adjuvant endocrine treatments should be offered to women with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive breast cancer who are postmenopausal? What is the appropriate duration?</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation II</span>. Women diagnosed with hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive breast cancer who are postmenopausal should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy with one of the following initial options:</p>
<p>Recommendation IIA. Tamoxifen for a duration of 10 years. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2013 evidence)</p>
<p>Recommendation IIB. An AI for a duration of 5 years. There are insufficient data currently to recommend an AI for a duration of greater than 5 years. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2010 evidence)</p>
<p>Recommendation IIC. Tamoxifen for an initial duration of 5 years, then switching to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2010 evidence)</p>
<p>Recommendation IID. Tamoxifen for a duration of 2 to 3 years and switching to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 7 to 8 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2010 evidence)</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question III</strong></p>
<p><em>What is the appropriate sequence of adjuvant endocrine therapy?</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation III</span>. Women who are postmenopausal and are intolerant of either tamoxifen or an AI should be offered the alternative type of adjuvant endocrine therapy.</p>
<p>Recommendation IIIA. If women have received an AI but discontinued treatment at less than 5 years, they may be offered tamoxifen for a total of 5 years. (Type: Informal Consensus; Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak; supported by 2010 evidence)</p>
<p>Recommendation IIIB. If women have received tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years, they should be offered the option of switching to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 7 to 8 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2010 evidence)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation IV</span>. Women who have received 5 years of tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered additional adjuvant endocrine treatment.</p>
<p>Recommendation IVA. If women are postmenopausal, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or the option of switching to up to 5 years of an AI, for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2010 and 2013 evidence)</p>
<p>Recommendation IVB. If women are pre- or perimenopausal, or menopausal status cannot be ascertained, they should be offered 5 additional years of tamoxifen, for a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. (Type: Evidence-based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong; supported by 2013 evidence)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2010 Recommendations (No Changes)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Are there specific patient populations that derive differing degrees of benefit from an AI in comparison to tamoxifen?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2</em>. Direct evidence from randomized trials does not identify a specific marker or clinical subset that predicted which adjuvant treatment strategy, tamoxifen or AI monotherapy or sequential therapy, would maximally improve outcomes for a given patient. Among men with breast cancer, tamoxifen remains the standard adjuvant endocrine treatment.</p>
<p>The Update Committee recommends against using CYP2D6 genotype to select adjuvant endocrine therapy. The Update Committee encourages caution with concurrent use of CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as bupropion, paroxetine, fluoxetine; see Table 5 in the original guideline document) and tamoxifen because of the known drug-drug interactions.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the toxicities and risks of adjuvant endocrine therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3</em>. The Update Committee recommends that clinicians consider adverse effect profiles, patient preferences, and pre-existing conditions when recommending an adjuvant endocrine strategy for postmenopausal women. Clinicians should discuss adverse effect profiles when presenting available treatment options to patients. The Update Committee suggests that clinicians consider recommending that patients change treatment if adverse effects are intolerable or if patients are persistently noncompliant with therapy.</p>
<p><strong>5. Can the third-generation AIs be used interchangeably?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5</em>. In the absence of direct comparisons, the Update Committee interprets available data as suggesting that benefits of AI therapy represent a &quot;class effect.&quot; Meaningful clinical differences between the commercially available third-generation AIs have not been demonstrated to date. In the clinical opinion of the Update Committee (rather than direct evidence from randomized trials), post-menopausal patients intolerant of one AI but who are still candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy may be advised to consider tamoxifen or a different AI.</p>

<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The literature search for this update was facilitated by the systematic review completed by Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) that reviewed available literature through May 2007. American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines staff conducted additional searches of the MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and Cochrane Collaboration Library electronic databases for published articles from May 2007 through February 2009 (list of MEDLINE search terms, see the Appendix in the original guideline document). In addition, electronic databases for presentations, posters, and abstracts presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) and ASCO Annual Meetings in 2007 and 2008 were searched. Additional sources were identified by hand-searching bibliographies of relevant articles. Search terms included all the agents under consideration (&quot;tamoxifen,&quot; &quot;anastrozole,&quot; &quot;exemestane,&quot; &quot;letrozole,&quot; and &quot;aromatase inhibitors&quot;) along with identified brand names (including European and North American versions). These terms were combined with the disease terminology &quot;breast neoplasms,&quot; &quot;carcinoma,&quot; &quot;adenocarcinoma,&quot; and &quot;tumor.&quot; The search was limited to phase III randomized, controlled trials; meta-analyses; systematic reviews; and existing practice guidelines. Other trial designs, including phase I or II trials and either prospective or retrospective cohort studies, were excluded. English-language studies available in full text and published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Following the Update Committee meeting, ASCO staff searched the programs for ASCO's 2009 Annual Meeting and the 2009 SABCS meeting to include updated data from the trials described therein.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles identified for inclusion in this systematic review met the following criteria: (1) the intervention was for the adjuvant therapy of breast cancer, (2) participants were randomly assigned to any of the treatments described previously, and (3) reports included at least one of the following primary outcomes of interest: overall survival, disease-free survival, or breast cancer-specific survival. Three different treatment strategies were identified on the basis of the timing of aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy: initial endocrine therapy (hereafter referred to as a primary adjuvant strategy), sequential therapy with treatment divergence if the patient was disease-free following 1 to 4 years of initial treatment with adjuvant endocrine agents (most often tamoxifen), or extended therapy with random assignment if the patient was disease-free following 5 years of treatment with adjuvant tamoxifen. Trials that used earlier generations of AIs, included neoadjuvant therapy, reported laboratory but not primary disease-related outcomes of interest, or were not randomized were excluded. Trials that treated patients with metastatic breast cancer were also excluded.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2014 Focused Update</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE database (PubMed: [date range: 2009/01/01 to 2013/03/04]) was searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) and ASCO conference proceedings were searched: SABCS for 2011, 2012; and ASCO for 2011, 2012, and 2013. Reference lists from seminal papers and recent review articles were scanned for additional citations. The literature search strategy and search results are available in Data Supplements 2 and 3 respectively (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Because this update addressed a question not specifically identified in previous updates, the search date parameters were broadened to find historical trials.</p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they were</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Published journal articles from the medical literature </li>
    <li>Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) </li>

<p>Reports and publications that met inclusion criteria were identified in a first round of review by members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff. The Update Committee co-chairs subsequently reviewed the list of articles, and staff obtained full-text copies of papers that satisfied the inclusion criteria. ASCO staff completed full-text review of these articles, including assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that provisionally met inclusion criteria underwent data extraction for patient characteristics, study design and quality, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. Evidence summary tables were reviewed for accuracy and completeness by an ASCO staff member who was not involved in their original preparation.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2014 Focused Update</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by an ASCO staff member in consultation with the Update Committee co-chairs. Data were extracted by one ASCO staff member and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the co-chairs, if necessary.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guideline Update Panel reconvened to develop an update. The ASCO technology assessment in 2004 on the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in the adjuvant setting identified multiple unanswered questions regarding optimal endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women. New data on these remaining questions formed the foundation for this guideline update. The Update Committee focused on the optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy with use of either tamoxifen, AIs, or both in sequence; the appropriate duration of AI therapy; the long-term adverse effects of AI therapy; identification of subpopulations who might derive selective benefit from either AI- or tamoxifen-based treatments; efficacy of AIs among premenopausal women; and similarities or differences among commercially available third-generation AIs.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Development Based on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee met twice, first in San Antonio in December 2008 and again at ASCO Headquarters in April 2009. The Update Committee was charged with updating the clinical questions, reviewing evidence collected from the systematic review, and drafting the new recommendations. Additional work on the guideline was primarily completed by the co-chairs and ASCO staff. The draft guideline document was developed by the co-chairs and ASCO staff and reviewed by the entire Update Committee.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2014 Focused Update</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Update Committee Composition</strong></p>
<p>To address the clinical question, an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, community oncology, patient representation, implementation, and guideline methodology was convened. The Update Committee was led by two co-chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Update Committee members are listed in Appendix Table AI (online only [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee met on several occasions and corresponded through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Update Committee along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the Committee meetings was for members to contribute content provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Update Committee participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz&amp;trade; software (<a href=&quot;http://medicine.yale.edu/cmi/glides/index.aspx&quot; title=&quot;GLIDES Web site&quot;>http://medicine.yale.edu/cmi/glides/index.aspx</a>). This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

<p>An adjuvant treatment strategy incorporating an aromatase inhibitor (AI) as primary (initial endocrine therapy), sequential (using both tamoxifen and an AI in either order), or extended (AI after 5 years of tamoxifen) therapy reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence compared with 5 years of tamoxifen alone. Data suggest that including an AI as primary monotherapy or as sequential treatment after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen yields similar outcomes.</p>

    <li>The Update Committee encourages caution with concurrent use of CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as bupropion, paroxetine, fluoxetine) and tamoxifen because of the known drug-drug interactions. </li>
    <li>Appendix Tables A4 through A8 in the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) include an abbreviated list of the adverse effects tabulated from the therapies evaluated in the prospective, randomized trials discussed. Four main categories of symptoms are detailed: cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gynecologic, and climacteric. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2014 Focused Update</strong></p>
<p>Women receiving extended adjuvant endocrine therapy are at risk for ongoing adverse effects, such as menopausal symptoms, and less common, but more serious, adverse effects. Tamoxifen is associated with risks of thromboembolism and uterine cancer. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are associated with ongoing risk of osteoporosis. Clinicians should monitor patients for sequelae of treatment according to established guidelines. Table 3 in the focused update document provides an abbreviated list of the adverse effects tabulated from the therapies evaluated in the prospective, randomized trials discussed.</p></div>"/>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO's) practice guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and literature available at the time they are written and are intended to assist physicians in clinical decision making and to identify questions and settings for further research. Because of the rapid flow of scientific information in oncology, new evidence may have emerged since the guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines and assessments are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines address only the topics specifically identified in the guideline and are not applicable to interventions, disease, or stages of disease not specifically identified. Guidelines cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge of the patient, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. ASCO guidelines describe the use of procedures and therapies in clinical practice and cannot be assumed to apply to the use of these interventions in the context of clinical trials. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of ASCO's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>Several important limitations of the existing literature were identified. Of particular note is the timing of random assignment (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). Most of the sequential trials and all the extended trials randomly assigned women who were free of recurrence through multiple years of tamoxifen therapy, effectively excluding women with early recurrence. For this reason, the patient populations in the sequential and extended trials may differ importantly from one another and from those patients in the primary therapy studies. Another limitation is the relatively short follow-up time. Post-menopausal breast cancer is a disease with a long natural history, and disease recurrence decades after diagnosis is not uncommon. The longest available median follow-up in the trials included here is slightly more than 8 years; most studies have considerably shorter follow-up. For the majority of the efficacy outcomes across all studies, the median time to event has yet to be reached. The relatively modest number of events may also limit study conclusions. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2014 Focused Update</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The clinical practice guidelines and other guidance published herein are provided by ASCO to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information therein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like &quot;must,&quot; &quot;must not,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; indicate that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>Limitations of the studies discussed in the focused update include differing amounts of median follow-up and the fact that the studies were performed in different eras, in part resulting in insufficient information to appraise the quality of three of the studies. Some of the populations in these studies did not have hormone receptor&amp;ndash;positive breast cancer and/or their hormone receptor status was unknown. In addition, there are relatively few new data on adverse events for those who have received adjuvant tamoxifen for more than 5 years. The studies in the focused update provided insufficient data on adverse effects, especially climacteric and/or sexual adverse effects. Evidence on a broader set of adverse events could affect women's risk-benefit perceptions and willingness to take tamoxifen for more than 5 years, perhaps modulated by age and menopausal status. The studies did not report on and/or did not measure health-related quality of life; at the time of the development of this guideline, results by menopausal status were not available, and there are few data on extended durations of aromatase inhibitors (AIs). </li>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network.
