	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%) (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should also advise such patients that clinical factors associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or trauma (<strong>Level A</strong>), an electroencephalogram (EEG) with epileptiform abnormalities (<strong>Level A</strong>), a significant brain-imaging abnormality (<strong>Level B</strong>), or a nocturnal seizure (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should advise patients that, although immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure (<strong>Level B</strong>), it may not improve quality of life (QOL) (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (&amp;gt;3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients should be advised that their risk for AED adverse events (AEs) ranges from 7% to 31% (<strong>Level B</strong>) and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Context</span></strong></p>
<p>For an adult with a first seizure, the risk of a recurrence poses major concerns and raises the question of whether immediate AED treatment is advisable. It is a proposed and now generally accepted principle that when a patient with a first seizure has one or more ensuing seizures, an AED should be initiated because the risk of yet additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years), with risk increasing proportionally after each subsequent recurrence as the time interval between seizures decreases. In contrast, immediate AED treatment at the time of the first unprovoked seizure is not well accepted and is debated.</p>
<p>For a patient with a first unprovoked seizure, the chance for a seizure recurrence can be estimated and stratified on the basis of clinical factors, with greater risk associated with a prior brain insult or lesion as the cause of the seizure, an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, a significant brain-imaging abnormality, or a nocturnal seizure. Such risk stratification may help guide physicians counseling patients about their risks for seizure recurrence and options for management. In some instances, a patient's statistical risk for a seizure recurrence may approach that of patients for whom immediate AED treatment is generally accepted, such as those who have already experienced multiple seizures. A recent report from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) promotes a new practical clinical definition of epilepsy that emphasizes the importance of estimating recurrence risk for individuals with a first unprovoked seizure. The ILAE expanded the diagnosis of epilepsy beyond the prior standard requiring at least 2 unprovoked seizures to encompass people with an unprovoked seizure and a high (at least 60%) risk of seizure recurrence over the subsequent 10 years. However, as analysis indicates and the ILAE cautions, the lack of evidence regarding specific risk factors and their interactions poses limitations.</p>
<p>Some of these risk factors may be independent predictors for risk of recurrence, whereas others (e.g., a prior brain lesion as a seizure cause, or a brain-imaging abnormality) likely are related. The relatively small numbers of subjects in studies addressing this issue limit the strength of evidence. Only 2 studies analyzed evidence specifically regarding additive effects or covariance of the risk factors for seizure recurrence after a first seizure, and reached somewhat different conclusions. One study noted that the only independent risk factor for seizure recurrence was an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, and the other reported a remote symptomatic seizure etiology as the only independent risk factor. Because of this lack of evidence, caution is urged regarding the calculation of additive risk of seizure recurrence after a first unprovoked seizure. The ILAE report states as much: &quot;No formula can be applied for additive risks since data are lacking on how such risks combine; such risks will have to be decided by individualized considerations.&quot; Such caution also applies to decisions in AED treatment.</p>
<p>Indications for immediate AED treatment are based largely but not only on estimations of an individual's risk of a seizure recurrence. Physicians planning to prescribe an AED for treatment should also carefully consider the drug's specific therapeutic and AE profiles on an individualized basis. Evidence indicates that immediate AED therapy is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk for individuals with an unprovoked first seizure, particularly within the first 2 years. Such seizure recurrence prevention, even in the short term, may be important, with potentially greater implications for adults than for children. For adults, seizure recurrences may cause such serious psychological and social consequences as loss of driving privileges and limitations on employment. Still, one controlled Class II study comparing immediate AED treatment with treatment deferred until after a seizure recurrence found no significant difference in standard 2-year QOL measures. However, that study also noted that patients who were not immediately treated with AEDs were more likely to be restricted from driving.</p>
<p>The longer-term prognosis for patients with a first seizure as measured by whether patients maintain seizure freedom demonstrates no benefit for immediate AED treatment. Moreover, although individual seizure recurrences pose some risk for physical harm and even death, there is no evidence that immediate AED treatment reduces that risk or improves QOL. Also, the only study appraising the incidence of sudden unexplained death after an unprovoked first seizure demonstrates no advantage with immediate AED therapy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification of Evidence Schemes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classification of Therapeutic Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>. Randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) in a representative population. Masked or objective outcome assessment. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent between treatment groups, or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. Also required: Concealed allocation. Primary outcomes clearly defined. Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined. Adequate accounting for dropouts.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>. Cohort study meeting criteria for Class I or a RCT that lacks one or two of those other criteria. All relevant baseline characteristics are present and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. Masked or objective outcome assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>. Controlled studies (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as their own controls). A description of major confounding differences between treatment groups that could affect outcome. Outcome assessment masked, objective or performed by someone who is not a member of the treatment team.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>. Did not include patients with the disease. Did not include patients receiving different interventions. Undefined or unaccepted interventions or outcome measures. No measures of effectiveness or statistical precision present or calculable.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Prognostic Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>. Cohort survey with prospective data collection. Includes a spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome. Outcome measurement is objective or determined without knowledge of risk for developing the outcome. Also required: a. Inclusion criteria defined b. At least 80% of enrolled subjects have both the risk factor and outcome measured.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>. Cohort study with retrospective data collection or case-controlled study. Study meets criteria a and b (see Class I). Includes a broad spectrum of persons with and without the risk factor and the outcome. The presence of the risk factor and outcome are determined objectively or without knowledge of one another.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>. Cohort or case control study. Narrow spectrum of persons with or without the disease. The presence of the risk factor and outcome are determined objectively or without knowledge of the other or by different investigators.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>. Did not include patients at risk for the outcome. Did not include patients with and without the risk factor. Undefined or accepted measures of risk factor or outcomes. No measures of association or statistical precision presented or calculable.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B </strong>= Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U </strong>= Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p></div>"/>

<p>This practice guideline considers the evidence for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. The authors posed three questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>What are the risks for seizure recurrence after a first seizure? </li>
    <li>Does immediate treatment with an antiepileptic drug (AED) reduce or change (a) short-term risks for a seizure recurrence or (b) long-term prognosis for seizure freedom or remission? </li>
    <li>For those patients prescribed AEDs immediately, what are the risks for adverse events (AEs)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The recommendations were linked to evidence strength based primarily on studies rated Class I or II (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Epilepsy Society (AES) are committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN and AES keep separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee before project initiation. AAN and AES limit the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN and AES forbid commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, at least one AES committee, a network of neurologists, Neurology peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
