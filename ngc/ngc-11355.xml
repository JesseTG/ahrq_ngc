	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

    <li>Was a well-defined representative sample of patients assembled at a common (usually early) point in the course of their disease? </li>
    <li>Was patient follow-up sufficiently long and complete? </li>

<p>The task force group assigned to vestibular schwannomas (VS) pathology collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014. Two electronic databases, including PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the full guideline [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p>The task force group supplemented searches of electronic databases with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The task force group also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. All articles identified are subject to the study selection criteria listed below. As noted above, the guideline committee also examines lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 688 citations were manually reviewed by the team with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. Two independent reviewers screened the abstracts to determine those worthy of full-text review. These two sets of data were compared for agreement by a third party. Inconsistencies were re-reviewed and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Citations that considered adult patients focusing on surgical treatment of VSs were considered. The following inclusions and exclusions were then applied:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having VSs </li>
    <li>Patients &amp;ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Published between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study (for novel molecular markers, in vitro studies were included on patient samples) </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or a commentary </li>
    <li>Studies may include mixed pathology; however, the data pertaining to VSs were abstractable from the paper </li>
    <li>&amp;gt;5 patients or patient samples </li>
</ul>
<p>The authors did not include systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by other authors. These documents were developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in this guideline. Therefore, they may include studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria stated above. The authors recalled these documents if their abstracts suggested that they might address one of the recommendations presented here, and the bibliographies were searched for additional studies.</p></div>"/>

<p>The articles deemed relevant for full-text review were then reviewed, and the study design, topic evaluated, and conclusions were extracted. The items in the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied before inclusion in the final dataset. For some questions, it became apparent that the data in the full-text articles were not able to provide meaningful support for any form of recommendation. These questions were dropped from the list of those that led to recommendations, and their topics were then moved for discussion in the &quot;Conclusion and Key Issues for Future Investigations&quot; section in the full guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessment for Risk of Bias</strong></span></p>
<p>The possibility of systematic bias in results was addressed by first stratifying the evidence based on the class of evidence quality, which highlights the limitations in this literature. Given the sparsity of evidence for many of these questions, formal methods for studying publication bias such as funnel plots were not possible</p>
<p>In addition, one obvious bias inherent to these studies is selection bias. For a patient to be in a pathology study, that patient, by definition, underwent microsurgical resection, which inherently biases the results toward larger and probably more aggressive tumors than would be seen in a cohort of all vestibular schwannomas (VSs). However, it is important to note that this bias is uniform across all studies of this type. Therefore, while individual practitioners may have skewed results by differences in case selection, there is no clear mechanism by which these biases are systematically distributed.</p></div>"/>

<p>After establishing vestibular schwannoma (VS) management as a priority for guideline development, the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), and the Guidelines Committee of the CNS selected a multidisciplinary group of individuals to carry out this project. The entire group of individuals was screened for conflict of interest and then assembled into smaller groups by general components of management. These groups then agreed upon the main questions pertinent to these management components and shared them with the overall group for modification. The task force was divided into groups by management topic to evaluate the literature and write the guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification System and Recommendation Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including AANS, CNS, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. In the paradigm for prognostic evidence, evidence is classified based on the 5 technical criteria5 technical criteria as outlined in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field. Refer also to the Joint Guideline Committee methodology document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>"/>
