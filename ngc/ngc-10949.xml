	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests using the terms &quot;history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)&quot; or &quot;concussion&quot; and to refrain from using the terms &quot;brain damage&quot; or &quot;patients with mTBI&quot; in communication with patients and the public. (<strong>Weak For; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends evaluating individuals who present with symptoms or complaints potentially related to brain injury at initial presentation. (<strong>Strong For; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>Excluding patients with indicators for immediate referral, for patients identified by post-deployment screening or who present to care with symptoms or complaints potentially related to brain injury, the Work Group suggests <strong><em>against</em></strong> using the following tests to establish the diagnosis of mTBI or direct the care of patients with a history of mTBI:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Neuroimaging </li>
        <li>Serum biomarkers, including S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100-B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCH-L1), neuron specific enolase (NSE), and &amp;alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) peptide </li>
        <li>Electroencephalogram (EEG) </li>
    </ol>
    <p>(<strong>Weak Against; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends <em><strong>against</strong></em> performing comprehensive neuropsychological/cognitive testing during the first 30 days following mTBI.

    <li>For patients identified by post-deployment screening or who present to care with symptoms or complaints potentially related to brain injury, the Work Group recommends <em><strong>against</strong></em> using the following tests in <em><strong>routine</strong></em> diagnosis and care of patients with symptoms attributed to mTBI:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Comprehensive and focused neuropsychological testing, including Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM), Neuro-Cognitive Assessment Tool (NCAT), or Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) </li>
    </ol>
    <p>(<strong>Strong Against; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>For patients with new symptoms that develop more than 30 days after mTBI, the Work Group suggests a focused diagnostic work-up specific to those symptoms only. (<strong>Weak For; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Co-occurring Conditions</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Headache education including topics such as stimulus control, use of caffeine/tobacco/alcohol and other stimulants </li>
        <li>Non-pharmacologic interventions such as sleep hygiene education, dietary modification, physical therapy (PT), relaxation and modification of the environment (for specific components for each symptom, see Appendix B in the original guideline document) </li>
        <li>Pharmacologic interventions as appropriate both for acute pain and prevention of headache attacks </li>
    </ol>
    <p>(<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dizziness and Disequilibrium</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
    <li>In individuals with a history of mTBI who present with functional impairments due to dizziness, disequilibrium, and spatial disorientation symptoms, the Work Group suggests that clinicians offer a short-term trial of specific vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive therapeutic exercise to assess the individual's responsiveness to treatment. Refer to occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT) or other vestibular trained care provider as appropriate. <strong><em>A prolonged course of therapy in the absence of patient improvement is strongly discouraged.</em></strong> (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;13&quot;>

<p><strong>Cognitive Symptoms</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;17&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that patients with a history of mTBI who report cognitive symptoms that do not resolve within 30 to 90 days and have been refractory to treatment for associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, headache) be referred as appropriate for a structured cognitive assessment or neuropsychological assessment to determine functional limitations and guide treatment. (<strong>Weak For; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that individuals with a history of mTBI who present with symptoms related to memory, attention or executive function problems that do not resolve within 30 to 90 days and have been refractory to treatment for associated symptoms should be referred as appropriate to cognitive rehabilitation therapists with expertise in TBI rehabilitation. The Work Group suggests considering a short-term trial of cognitive rehabilitation treatment to assess the individual patient responsiveness to strategy training, including instruction and practice on use of memory aids, such as cognitive assistive technologies (AT). <em><strong>A prolonged course of therapy in the absence of patient improvement is strongly discouraged.</strong></em> (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests <em><strong>against </strong></em>offering medications, supplements, nutraceuticals or herbal medicines for ameliorating the neurocognitive effects attributed to mTBI. (<strong>Weak Against; Not reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Setting of Care</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;20&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests <em><strong>against routine</strong></em> referral to specialty care in the majority of patients with a history of mTBI. (<strong>Weak Against; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>If the patient's symptoms do not resolve within 30 to 90 days and are refractory to initial treatment in primary care and significantly impact activities of daily living (ADLs), the Work Group suggests consultation and collaboration with a locally designated TBI or other applicable specialist. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with persistent symptoms that have been refractory to initial psychoeducation and treatment, the Work Group suggests referral to case managers within the primary care setting to provide additional psychoeducation, case coordination and support. (<strong>Weak For; Reviewed, Amended</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary teams in the management of patients with chronic symptoms attributed to mTBI. (<strong>N/A; Reviewed, New-replaced</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, &quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;Weak.&quot; A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>The grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests not offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends against offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed &quot;Conditional,&quot; &quot;Discretionary,&quot; or &quot;Qualified.&quot; Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Categories and Definitions</strong></p>
<p>For use in the 2016 mTBI clinical practice guideline (CPG), a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Developing the Scope and Key Questions</strong></span></p>
<p>The Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying key evidence questions to guide the systematic review of the literature on mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations. The key questions (KQs) follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A‐1 in the original guideline provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology.</p>
<p>The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs were not able to be included in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, and those were included in the review. Table A-2 in the original guideline document contains the final set of KQs used to guide the systematic review for this CPG.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Conducting the Systematic Review</strong></span></p>
<p>Extensive literature searches identified 3,259 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 1,663 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, not a full-length article). Overall, 1,596 abstracts were reviewed with 1,308 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not a systematic review or clinical study, did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not enroll a population of interest, or published prior to January 2008. A total of 288 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 193 were excluded at a first pass review for the following reasons: not addressing a KQ of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for clinical study or systematic review, not meeting inclusion criteria for any KQ, or being a duplicate. A total of 95 full-length articles were thought to address one or more KQs and were further reviewed. Of these, 51 were ultimately excluded for the reasons detailed in Figure A-1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Overall, 42 studies (in 44 publications) addressed one or more of the KQs and were considered as evidence in the review. Table A-2 in the original guideline document indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Study Inclusion/Exclusion</strong></p>
<p><em>General Criteria</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinical studies or systematic reviews published on or after January 1, 2008. If multiple systematic reviews addressed a KQ, the most recent and/or comprehensive review was selected. Clinical studies published subsequent to relevant systematic reviews were used to supplement the evidence base. </li>
    <li>Studies must have been published in English. </li>
    <li>Publication must be a full clinical study or systematic review; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that are not full-length, clinical studies were not accepted as evidence. </li>
    <li>Studies enrolled adults 18 years or older. In studies that mixed adults and children, at least 80% of the enrolled patients had to be 18 years or older. </li>
    <li>Studies must have enrolled &amp;ge;10 patients per treatment arm. </li>
    <li>Study must have reported on an outcome of interest. </li>
    <li>Study must have enrolled a patient population in which the most prevalent diagnosis is mTBI, with identifiable data for the population of interest (i.e., patients with a history of mTBI should be identifiable in the dataset). Studies that did not report separate data for mTBI were included only in the absence of other studies meeting this criterion, and only if the remaining patients in the study had moderate or severe TBI (not stroke). However, studies including at least 80% of patients with a history of mTBI were not required to report separate data for patients with a history of mTBI. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Key Question-Specific Criteria</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For KQ 1a, studies must have focused on use of specialized diagnostic approaches used at less than seven days following injury (acute period). For KQ 1b, studies must have focused on use of specialized diagnostic approaches at least seven days after the time of injury (post-acute period). Studies must have compared specialized diagnostic approaches to no test or usual care. For assessment of diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic cohort studies that compared a diagnostic test(s) to a reference standard within the same patient were acceptable. </li>
    <li>For KQ 2, non-randomized trials, cohort studies, case-controlled studies, and other observational studies were accepted as evidence in addition to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Assessments must have been made at least seven days after the time of injury. </li>
    <li>For KQ 3, study must have been a systematic review of RCTs or an RCT. If insufficient evidence met this criterion, then controlled observational studies were considered as evidence for this question. Assessments must have been made at least seven days after the time of injury. </li>
    <li>For KQs 4&amp;ndash;10, study must have been a systematic review of RCTs or an RCT. If insufficient evidence met this criterion, then controlled observational studies were considered as evidence for these questions. The minimum follow-up was three months. </li>

</ul>
<p><em>Key Question-Specific Search Strategies</em></p>
<p>Embase.com was used to search for unique EMBASE (EMTREE) records. OVID was used to simultaneously search Medline (MeSH) and PsycINFO. Similar strategies were used to search CINAHL and PubMed, as well as the ancillary databases listed above. </p>
<p>Specific search strings were used to capture studies based on the KQs identified by the mTBI Working Group. Unique strategies were structured for each question and pertain to diagnostic methods, mechanisms of injury, care settings, dizziness, headaches, impaired concentration and memory, behavioral problems, sleep disturbance, tinnitus, and vision impairment. These search results were further refined to capture specific study designs, publication types, date ranges, patient populations, English language studies, and to exclude out-of-scope citations.</p>

<p>For each study included in the systematic review, the following study level details were abstracted: country, purpose, and quality rating. For previous systematic reviews, the review team reported the search strategy used, study selection criteria, and overall information about the evidence base, including number of included studies and overall patients enrolled. For all studies, the reviewers abstracted data about characteristics of the included patients and interventions being assessed. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessing Individual Studies' Methodological Quality (i.e., Internal Validity or Risk of Bias)</strong></span></p>
<p>As per the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) <em>Guidelines for Guidelines</em> document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), risk-of-bias (or study quality) of individual studies and previous systematic reviews was assessed using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) method. Each study was assigned a rating of Good, Fair, or Poor based on sets of criteria that vary depending on study design. Detailed lists of criteria and definitions of Good, Fair, or Poor ratings for different study designs appear in Appendix VII of the <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Home/GetFile/6/7/procedure-manual_2016/pdf&quot; title=&quot;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Web site&quot;>USPSTF procedure manual</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>A narrative approach to synthesizing the evidence for all the Key Questions (KQs) was used. As indicated in the VA/DoD <em>Guidelines for Guidelines</em> document, the first line of evidence was previous systematic reviews. For questions in which a previous review was available, individual studies that met the systematic review's inclusion criteria were used to supplement or update the previous review. Reviewers considered whether subsequent evidence supports the conclusions reported in the previous review. For questions for which no previous review was available, the overall findings for the outcomes of interest of the studies that addressed a KQ were summarized. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessing the Overall Quality of the Body of Evidence for an Outcome</strong></span></p>
<p>The overall quality of the body of evidence supporting the findings for the outcomes of interest in this report was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The GRADE system primarily involves consideration of the following factors: overall study quality (or overall risk of bias or study limitations), consistency of evidence, directness of evidence, and precision of evidence. Given time and resources, other factors such as publication bias may also be considered. For more information on the GRADE system go to the <a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Working Group Web site&quot;>GRADE working group Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The GRADE system rates the overall quality of the evidence as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The overall quality of a body of evidence is rated based on the factors described in Table 1 in the systematic review. For instance, a body of evidence that consists of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) automatically starts with a rating of high quality. This rating can be downgraded if some of the RCTs have serious flaws such as lack of blinding of outcome assessors, not reporting concealment of allocation, or high dropout rate. Similarly, the quality can be downgraded or further downgraded if inconsistencies of findings are present or if there is a lack of precision surrounding an outcome's effect size. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Assessing Applicability</strong></span></p>
<p>When describing the evidence base addressing a KQ, the evidence review team discussed aspects of the included studies, such as characteristics of included patients and treatments being assessed that may make the overall findings of the studies more or less applicable to the population, treatments, or outcomes of interest to this review.</p></div>"/>

<p>The current guideline is an update to the 2009 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) clinical practice guideline (CPG). The methodology used in developing the 2016 CPG follows the <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal document of the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development and publication of an updated mTBI CPG.</p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, as well as writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Specifically, the Champions and the Work Group members for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) of the greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management of patients with a history of mTBI. The amount of new scientific evidence that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was also taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. The Champions and the Work Group also provide direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level of quality of the evidence. In addition, the Champions assisted in:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes </li>
</ul>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified three clinical leaders as Champions for the 2016 CPG.</p>
<p>The Lewin Team (Team), including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The team held the first conference call in December 2014, with participation from the contracting officer's representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review about the management of mTBI. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of mTBI, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: blind rehabilitation, family medicine, occupational therapy (OT), language neurology, nursing, pharmacy, physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&amp;amp;R), physical therapy (PT), polytrauma care, primary care, psychiatry, psychology, and speech-language pathology. </p>
<p>The guideline development process for the 2016 CPG update consisted of the following steps: </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Formulating and prioritizing KQs for the systematic review </li>
    <li>Conducting the systematic review </li>
    <li>Convening a face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting and submitting a final CPG about the management of mTBI to the VA/DoD EBPWG </li>
</ol>
<p>Appendix A in the original guideline document provides a detailed description of each of these tasks.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Convening the Face-to-face Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p>In consultation with the COR, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and a half day face-to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on June 29&amp;ndash;July 2, 2015. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2009 mTBI CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review of KQs 1-10 in order to facilitate and inform the process. </p>
<p>Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to review, assess, and categorize recommendations from the 2009 mTBI CPG. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not present in the 2009 mTBI CPG, based on the 2015 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into three smaller subgroups at this meeting. </p>
<p>As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Grading Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength of each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes </li>
    <li>Confidence in the quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Values and preferences </li>
    <li>Other implications, as appropriate, include:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Resource Use </li>
        <li>Equity </li>
        <li>Acceptability </li>
        <li>Feasibility </li>
        <li>Subgroup considerations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The framework presented in Table A-7 in the original guideline document was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain.</p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework in Table A-7, which combines the four domains. GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low. In these types of instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation.</p>
<p>The GRADE of a recommendation (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; is based on the following elements:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction </li>
    <li>Relative strength (Strong or Weak) </li>
    <li>Direction (For or Against) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Reconciling 2009 CPG Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Evidence-based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions based on new evidence or as scheduled subject to time-based expirations. For example, the USPSTF has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations pertaining to preventive services. Further, the inclusion criteria for the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) specify that a guideline must have been developed, reviewed, or revised within the past five years.</p>
<p>The mTBI Guideline Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Guideline Work Group considered the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the previous 2009 mTBI CPG, subject to evolving practice in today's environment. </p>
<p>A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, UK). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the categories took into account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation was systematically reviewed as part of the update, the degree to which the recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current patient care environment and inside the scope of the CPG (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Appendix A in the original guideline document. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2016 version of the guideline are noted in the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field. </p>
<p>Because the 2009 mTBI CPG was developed using an evidence-rating method (USPSTF method) differing from the methodology currently used (GRADE method), the CPG Work Group recognized the need to accommodate the transition in evidence rating systems from the 2009 mTBI CPG to the current CPG. In order to report the strength of all recommendations using a consistent format (i.e., the GRADE system) the CPG Work Group converted the USPSTF strengths of the recommendation accompanying the carryover recommendations from the 2009 guideline to the GRADE system. As such, the CPG Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recommendation in the 2009 mTBI CPG as well as harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where appropriate. The CPG Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2009 mTBI CPG and did not assess the evidence review systematically that was conducted for the 2009 mTBI CPG. In some instances, selected peer-reviewed literature published since the 2009 mTBI CPG was considered along with the evidence base used for that CPG. When newer literature was considered in converting the strength of the recommendation from the USPSTF to GRADE system, it is referenced in the discussion of the corresponding recommendation, as well as in Appendix D in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The CPG Work Group recognizes that, while there are practical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous systematic review, previous recommendations, or recent peer-reviewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive systematic review and, therefore, may introduce bias. In contrast, the recommendations labeled as &quot;Reviewed&quot; were based on a new or an updated systematic review of the literature.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Drafting and Submitting the Final CPG </span></strong></p>
<p>Following the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discussion sections from the 2009 mTBI CPG to support the amended &quot;carried forward&quot; recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2009 mTBI CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made additional revisions to the algorithms, as necessary. </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, &quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;Weak.&quot; A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>The grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak For</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Weak Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group suggests not offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or &quot;The Work Group recommends against offering this option &amp;hellip;&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed &quot;Conditional,&quot; &quot;Discretionary,&quot; or &quot;Qualified.&quot; Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation Categories and Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p>For use in the 2016 mild traumatic brain injury clinical practice guideline, a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated.</p>

Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. </li>
    <li>Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. </li>
    <li>These guidelines are not intended to represent TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits may be found at <a href=&quot;http://www.tricare.mil&quot; title=&quot;TRICARE Web site&quot;>www.tricare.mil</a> or by contacting your regional TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) and associated algorithms were designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with consideration of local needs and resources. The algorithms serve as tools to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of an episode of care. Within the body of the CPG, the recommendations offer evidence-based guidance for the care of patients with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Appendix B in the original guideline also offers users of the CPG a symptom-based clinical guide to best practices that have been reviewed by the Work Group. It should be noted that this material is set apart from the body of the CPG because it is based on expert consensus and common clinical practice. In addition, a clinician summary, clinician pocket card, and patient guide were developed to accompany this CPG to facilitate use of the content (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest in the past two years, including verbal affirmations of no conflict of interest at regular meetings. The project team was also subject to random Web-based surveillance (e.g., ProPublica). If there was a positive (yes) conflict of interest response (actual or potential), then action was taken by the co-chairs and evidence-based practice program office, based on the level and extent of involvement, to mitigate the conflict of interest. Actions ranged from restricting participation and/or voting on sections related to a conflict, to removal from the Work Group. Recusal was determined by the individual, co-chairs, and the Office of Evidence Based Practice. </p>
<p>Noted conflict of interest disclosures: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>COL Sidney Hinds II, MD, has previously served on the National Football League (NFL) Head Trauma Advisory Board; however, over 12 months has elapsed since this engagement. </li>
    <li>Scott McDonald, PhD, is involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI) research that is funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and by General Dynamics. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above disclosures were brought forward by the individuals and evaluated by VA/Department of Defense (DoD) leadership. Given the nature of the disclosures, the Work Group members were authorized to continue work on the clinical practice guideline (CPG) in an unrestricted capacity.</p></div>"/>
