	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between June 2005 and April 2014. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites, recommendations from the literature, and key Web sites related to person- and family-centred-care practices. Furthermore, expert panel members were asked to provide guidelines from their own personal libraries.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Guideline Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Structured Web Site Search</strong></p>
<p>A member of the RNAO guideline development team (project coordinator) searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines.</p>
<p>Guidelines were selected based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Focus on topic of person-centred care (terms include: person- or client- or patient- or family-centred or -oriented or -focused or -directed care or practice or intervention, relationships or partnerships) which includes:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Defining concepts, dimensions, components, or core processes of which includes facilitators and barriers </li>
        <li>Health-care practices or behaviours demonstrating </li>
        <li>Effective models of </li>
        <li>Basic Curricula or ongoing education/training programs or education needs for knowledge and skills to practice person centred care </li>
        <li>Organization or health-system supports or responsibilities for implementation </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Published no earlier than June 2005 </li>
    <li>Published in English, national and international in scope </li>
    <li>Accessible for retrieval </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong></p>
<p>RNAO expert panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify and submit potentially relevant guidelines. Guidelines submitted for consideration by RNAO expert panel members were integrated into the retrieved list of guidelines if they had not been identified by the on-line guideline search and met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles in English published between June 2005 and April 2014 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), EMBASE, Joanna Briggs Institute, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Progress, and PsycINFO. In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria, is available in the guideline search strategy document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, two RNAO Best Practice Guideline (BPG) nursing research associates (nurses holding master's degrees) independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The RNAO's BPG program manager, involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel, resolved disagreements.</p></div>"/>

<p>For this revised guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas (see the &quot;Composition of Group That Authored the Guideline&quot; field). A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope of the original guideline, <em>Client Centred Care</em>, and the revision supplement, and was supported by five clinical questions. The systematic review captured relevant literature and guidelines published between June 2005 and April 2014. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>What is person-centred care?
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>How is person-centred care defined? </li>
        <li>What are the components of person-centred care? </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>What nursing or health-care provider behaviours demonstrate a person-centred approach during the delivery (assessment, planning, management, and evaluation) of care to a person? </li>
    <li>What are the evidence-based models of care delivery that demonstrate effective outcomes and support person-centred care?
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Components of effective person-centred care models? </li>
        <li>Enablers to the provision of the person-centred care in the model? </li>
        <li>Barriers to the provision of person-centred care in the model? </li>
        <li>Impact on satisfaction with care within all health settings? </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>What components of person-centred care should be taught in basic curricula or ongoing professional education programs? </li>
    <li>What organizational or system structures support successful implementation of person-centred care? </li>
</ol>
<p>The expert panel's mandate was to review the original Guideline and the revision supplement in light of the new evidence to ensure the continuing validity, appropriateness, and safety of the recommendations. This new revised Guideline is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence into the recommendations with the supporting evidence from original Guideline and the revision supplement (where applicable).</p></div>"/>

<p>Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication.</p>
<p>Stakeholder feedback is submitted on-line by completing a survey questionnaire. The stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:</p>

<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see Appendix G in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the &quot;Knowledge-to-Action&quot; framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of the Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). The RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including: 1) the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&amp;reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; 2) nursing order sets which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments; and 3) the Best Practice Spotlight Organization&amp;reg; (BPSO&amp;reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs&amp;reg; focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. In addition, the RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation annually.</p>
