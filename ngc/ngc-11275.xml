	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>In adults with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests reactive therapeutic drug monitoring to guide treatment changes. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Comment</em>: Table 4 in the original guideline document summarizes suggested trough concentration for anti-TNF therapy, for patients with active IBD on maintenance therapy. Of note, there may be a small subset of patients who may still respond by targeting higher target concentrations. Optimal trough concentrations for induction therapy are uncertain. </p>
<p>In adult patients with quiescent IBD treated with anti-TNF agents, the AGA makes no recommendation regarding the use of routine proactive therapeutic drug monitoring. (<strong>No recommendation, Knowledge gap</strong>) </p>
<p>In adult patients with IBD being started on thiopurines, the AGA suggests routine thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) testing (enzymatic activity or genotype) to guide thiopurine dosing. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Low quality of evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Comment</em>: Routine laboratory monitoring, including complete blood count (CBC), should be performed, regardless of TPMT testing results. </p>
<p>In adult patients treated with thiopurines with active IBD or adverse effects thought to be due to thiopurine toxicity, the AGA suggests reactive thiopurine metabolite monitoring to guide treatment changes. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Comment</em>: When measuring thiopurine metabolite monitoring in patients with active IBD-related symptoms, the AGA suggests a target 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) cutoff between 230 and 450 pmol/8 x 10<sup>8</sup> red blood cells (RBCs) when used as monotherapy; optimal 6-TGN cutoff when thiopurines are used in combination with anti-TNF agents is uncertain. </p>
<p>In adult patients with quiescent IBD treated with thiopurines, the AGA suggests against routine thiopurine metabolite monitoring. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, Very low quality of evidence</strong>) </p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Formulation of Clinical Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Using the PICO format, which frames a clinical question by defining a specific population (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcomes (O), the team finalized 5 questions (refer to Table 1 in the technical review [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The first set of PICOs focused on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for anti-anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and the second set of PICOs on TDM for thiopurines. Questions focused on comparing different strategies of TDM classified as reactive TDM or routine proactive TDM. <em>Reactive TDM</em> is defined as TDM performed in response to active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (ongoing active inflammation based on biochemical, endoscopic, or radiologic assessment, usually with symptoms) after a period of quiescent disease, or continued inflammation without achieving remission with index therapy; of note, a small fraction of patients, especially those with active Crohn's disease (CD) (active inflammation) may be asymptomatic, and the concept of reactive TDM also applies to those patients. <em>Routine proactive TDM</em> was defined as TDM performed in patients regardless of clinical status (generally in quiescent disease) periodically as part of routine clinical care. The comparator strategy relied on empiric treatment changes&amp;mdash;for anti-TNF agents, this focused on a stepwise approach of empiric escalation of therapy or switching to different treatment agents within or outside the index class (i.e., with same putative mechanism of action or with a different mechanism of action). Potentially relevant patient-important outcomes were considered and rated in terms of importance through consensus; clinical remission was considered critical for decision making, whereas mucosal healing (endoscopic remission), serious adverse events, cost, drug or metabolite concentration, and patient convenience were considered important outcomes. The technical report panel recognized limitations of using a clinical disease activity as an outcome measure, especially for CD, but still believed that in the current context, it is the most consistently reported outcome in clinical practice and is important for patients.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Search Strategy and Study Selection Criteria</strong></span></p>
<p>The literature search was performed on March 6, 2016, and details of the search strategy are reported in the technical report supplementary material (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Studies were selected for inclusion based on PICO theme. Due to lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) informing each question, the study selection and data synthesis approach were customized for each question. For PICO #1 (reactive TDM) and PICO #2 (routine proactive TDM), for anti-TNF agents, the technical report panel included RCTs, comparative observational studies, or cohort studies in adults with IBD, with either active IBD or quiescent disease, treated with anti-TNF agents, who underwent TDM (i.e., measurement of drug levels and/or anti-drug antibodies [ADAbs]). Due to the paucity of high-quality RCTs and observational comparative studies for PICOs #1 and #2, the panel relied on cohort studies that reported differences in outcomes of patients depending on trough level and/or presence of ADAb, in response to empiric dose escalation and/or switching therapies. This provided indirect evidence on potential risks and benefits of TDM-guided treatment decisions compared with empiric treatment changes. For PICO #3 on the role of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity or genotype before starting thiopurines, the panel included RCTs in patients with IBD who were started on thiopurines, based on either TPMT guidance or empirically, and evaluated safety and efficacy of therapy. For PICOs #4 and #5 on application of TDM strategies for thiopurines, a similar approach was adopted, wherein, if high-quality RCTs or observational comparative studies were lacking, cohort studies were used to inform evidence indirectly. </p>
<p>To inform optimal target trough concentrations and their performance, the panel initially searched for RCTs or observational comparative studies that report differences in patient outcomes based on different target trough concentration thresholds. In the absence of comparative studies, they chose cohort and cross-sectional studies that reported correlation between different thresholds and presence or absence of clinical remission (or response) and assessed the pooled proportion of patients &quot;not in remission&quot; above certain predefined thresholds. Of note, these were not framed as PICOs, but are rather presented semi-quantitatively to inform clinical guidelines.</p>
<p>To inform evidence pertaining to these focused questions, a systematic literature search of multiple electronic databases on TDM in IBDs was conducted by an experienced medical librarian using a combination of controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords, with input from the technical review authors. The search was conducted from inception to March 6, 2016, and the databases included: Ovid Medline In-Process &amp;amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (detailed search strategy listed in the supplementary materials). Technical review context experts and methodologist independently reviewed the title and abstract of studies identified in the search to exclude studies that did not address the focused question based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full text of the remaining articles was examined to determine whether it contained relevant information, and relevant articles at end of this process were selected for each question. Conflicts in study selection at this stage were resolved by consensus, referring back to the original article in consultation with clinical content experts. This search was supplemented with a recursive search of the bibliographies of recently published systematic reviews on this topic, to identify any additional studies. The panel also reviewed conference proceedings from major gastroenterology conferences from 2011 through 2016, and contacted experts in the field for any potential unpublished studies. They restricted their search to English language and human studies. Filters were applied to exclude editorials, letters to the editor and case reports.</p></div>"/>

<p>When comparative studies were available, pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using DerSimonian-Liard random-effects model. For population, intervention, comparator and outcomes (PICOs) #1 and #4, as well as in assessing performance of different trough concentration thresholds, the panel estimated weighted pooled proportion of patients in different relevant categories, using random-effects meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I&amp;sup2; statistic, and values &amp;gt;50% were considered suggestive of significant heterogeneity. Small study effects were examined using funnel plot symmetry and Egger's regression test, though it is important to recognize that these tests are unreliable when the number of studies is &amp;lt;10. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan, version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) or Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality of evidence (or confidence in summary effect estimates). In this approach, direct evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) starts at high quality and can be rated down based on risk of bias in the body of evidence (or study quality), indirectness (addressing a different but related population, intervention, or outcome, from the one of interest), imprecision (of summary estimate and boundaries of 95% CI), inconsistency (or heterogeneity), and/or publication bias to levels of moderate, low, and very low quality. Due to inherent limitations in observational studies (i.e., selection bias, unmeasured confounding), evidence derived from observational studies starts at low quality, and is then potentially downgraded based on the factors mentioned, or can be upgraded in case of dose-response relationship and large magnitude of effect. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Evidence-to-Decision Framework</strong></span></p>
<p>Because the technical review was used to inform the development of clinical guidelines, besides a comprehensive risk&amp;ndash;benefit analysis and the accompanying quality of evidence, information about additional factors, such as patients' values and preferences, cost-effectiveness, and resource utilization were also considered.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Besides the mild inconvenience of blood test for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), there is potential misclassification and missed treatment optimization opportunities due to suboptimally defined thresholds for both drug concentration and ant-drug antibodies (ADAb). </li>
    <li>TDM is performed through a blood test generally just before next due dose, which can cause a small inconvenience. However, there are additional potential harms of downstream interventions from TDM testing because thresholds for therapeutic trough concentration and ADAbs are not very well-defined. Therapeutic trough is dynamic, depending on phase of intervention (induction vs maintenance therapy), treatment target (clinical remission vs endoscopic remission), and phase of disease activity (severe active vs mild active disease; luminal disease vs perianal disease). Likewise, threshold ADAb levels that define immunogenicity and predict low likelihood of response to dose escalation are not well-defined and are variable across assays. Therefore, due to variable thresholds, which have suboptimal discriminatory performance, strict adherence to TDM-guided treatment changes can potentially result in inappropriate treatment changes in some patients who might have responded to empiric escalation of therapy. </li>
    <li>Incidental findings during thiopurine metabolite testing can potentially result in unwarranted treatment changes. With the availability of several newer and more effective therapeutic agents over the last decade, attempts at close metabolite monitoring and serial dose adjustments can potentially delay more effective therapy in a subset of underdosed patients who may be inherently thiopurine-resistant.&amp;nbsp; </li>
    <li>While testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) may potentially delay starting therapy for approximately 1 to 2 weeks (while awaiting test results), it is likely inconsequential given the slow onset of action of this medication. </li>
