	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

        <li>Prior to treatment, assess causative and contributive factors and significant signs and symptoms to differentiate types of lower-extremity wounds, which require varying treatments (see the Algorithm: Differential Assessment of Wounds, Appendix A in the original guideline document). <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Review health history to identify risk factors for lower-extremity arterial disease (LEAD) (e.g., tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, renal insufficiency, etc.), wound history, pain history, history of prescribed/self-prescribed medications, and coexisting diseases and comorbidities. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong>
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Assess pain characteristics: Onset, duration, location, precipitating and alleviating factors, and presence or absence of intermittent claudication. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Differentiate acute limb ischemia (i.e., rapid, sudden decrease in limb perfusion often associated with thrombosis) from critical limb ischemia (CLI) that is chronic and progressive in nature due to atherosclerosis. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Review pertinent labs to identify risk markers for LEAD:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides; reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Elevated homocysteine. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Assess the wound:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Determine wound characteristics: Location, pain, shape, size, color of wound base and type tissue, wound edges, periwound skin, exudate, and presence/absence of odor or necrosis. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Assess for wound complications: Infection, cellulitis, gangrene or osteomyelitis. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Conduct a comprehensive, bilateral lower-extremity examination:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Assess functional ability and physical activity. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Assess the lower extremities for ischemic skin changes: Purpura, atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle; shiny and taut skin, hair loss and/or dystrophic nails. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Perform a vascular assessment (e.g., pedal pulses, ankle brachial index [ABI]) on any individual that presents with a pressure ulcer on the lower limb/foot/heel. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Determine perfusion status by assessing skin temperature, capillary refill, venous refill, color changes and paresthesias. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Determine presence or absence of pedal pulses. Palpate both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses of each lower extremity. Presence of palpable pulses does not rule out LEAD. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Auscultate femoral/popliteal arteries for bruits. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Observe for signs of neuropathy (e.g., decreased sensation, weakness of ankles or feet, gait abnormalities, foot drop/drag), which can cause impaired muscle function. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Determine neurosensory status by screening both feet for loss of protective sensation with a monofilament, tuning fork and percussion hammer. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Measure the ABI using a Doppler and sphygmomanometer to assess arterial blood flow in both lower extremities and determine the level of ischemia. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Calculate ABI for each leg using the higher of the ankle pressures (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) divided by the higher of the brachial pressures from the right or left arm. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Interpret the ABI taking into consideration the overall results of the clinical exam:
            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>Normal: ABI greater than or equal to 1.00; LEAD: ABI less than or equal to 0.90; borderline perfusion: ABI less than or equal to 0.60 to 0.80; severe ischemia: ABI less than or equal to 0.50; and critical ischemia: ABI less than or equal to 0.40. </li>
                <li>The ABI can be elevated (&amp;gt;1.30) in individuals with diabetes, renal failure or arthritis due to calcification of the ankle arteries, which can also cause noncompressible arteries (i.e., unable to obliterate the pulse signal at a cuff pressure &amp;gt;250 mmHg). </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>Recheck the ABI periodically (every 3 months) for patients with nonhealing, lower-extremity wounds. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Refer patients who have symptoms of LEAD but a normal, resting ABI to a vascular laboratory for an exercise ABI test, or other testing. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Measure toe pressures with photoplethysmography/determine a toe brachial index (TBI) if the ABI is greater than 1.30, unmeasurable, or the vessels are non-compressible.
            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>TBI less than 0.64 indicates LEAD. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
                <li>A systolic toe pressure less than 30 mmHg or less than 50 mmHg in persons with diabetes indicates CLI. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Assess tissue perfusion with transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TcPO2) if a wound is not healing and the ABI is less than 0.90, toe pressure is less than 30 mmHg, or if unable to perform an ABI or toe pressure/TBI because of noncompressible ankle arteries or an amputation. A TcPO2 less than 40 mmHg is considered hypoxic and is associated with impaired wound healing. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Consider noninvasive tests if the ABI, toe pressure, TBI or TcPO2 are inconclusive or cannot be performed; or if the ABI is greater than 1.30:
            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>Duplex ultrasound. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
                <li>Pulse volume recordings. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
                <li>Skin perfusion pressures. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider additional noninvasive tests to select surgical or endovascular candidates:

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
        <li>Do not debride wounds with stable, black eschars until perfusion status is determined: Debridement may be contraindicated. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class IV)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider revascularization and surgical removal of necrotic tissue from an infected wound on an ischemic leg, which is the treatment of choice for limb salvage. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Closely monitor autolytic or enzymatic debridement if used for open, draining ischemic wounds with necrotic tissue. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Dressings</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
        <li>Choose dressings for ischemic wounds that permit frequent visualization and inspection of the wound. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>

    </ol>
    <p><strong>Infection</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;11&quot;>
        <li>Monitor ischemic wounds closely for signs/symptoms of infection, which can be subtle because of reduced blood flow. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Use tissue biopsy, considered the gold standard, to confirm a diagnosis of infection.

    <p><strong>Antibiotics</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;14&quot;>
        <li>Consider topical antibiotic dressings for a limited time (e.g., 2 weeks) if critical colonization is suspected. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Do not rely solely on topical antibiotics to treat infected, ischemic wounds. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class IV)</em></strong> </li>

    <p><strong>Pain Management</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;19&quot;>
        <li>Institute a regular exercise program for medically stable patients with intermittent claudication. Supervised exercise sessions, 3 times per week, of 30 to 60 minutes of treadmill or track walking to the point of pain, followed by rest, promotes increased pain-free walking and total walking distances. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class I)</em></strong> </li>

            <li>Lumbar sympathectomy. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Peridural anesthesia. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        </ul>
        </li>

    <p><strong>Compression Issues/Management of Edema in Patients with Mixed Arterial/Venous Disease</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;23&quot;>
        <li>Use a reduced level of compression (23 to 30 mmHg at the ankle) for patients with LEAD, venous disease, wounds, and edema (ABI &amp;gt;0.50 to &amp;lt;0.80); and closely supervise the patient for complications. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Avoid compression if ABI is less than 0.50; ankle pressure is less than 70 mmHg, or toe pressure is less than 50 mmHg. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class IV)</em></strong>
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>If the patient is revascularized, consider compression to manage the edema due to the venous disease. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Carefully monitor patients with neuropathy if compression is provided because they may not sense pain or discomfort from compression that is too tight. <strong><em>(TFC)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider use of graduated, compression stockings (18 to 30 mmHg) to manage postoperative edema after lower-extremity, bypass surgery. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class III)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>If LEAD is present (ABI &amp;le;0.90), prior to the use of antiembolism compression stockings (AECS) or mechanical devices, consult with the primary healthcare provider to determine if AECS/mechanical devices are indicated and safe, or if other interventions are warranted. <strong><em>Level of evidence = C (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Medications</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;28&quot;>
        <li>Recommend statin therapy for lipid control, to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Recommend antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole) for patients with symptomatic LEAD to decrease mortality and cardiovascular events. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class I)</em></strong>
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Cilostazol (100 mg oral 2 times per day) increases HDL cholesterol, decreases triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, and improves the walking distances of patients with intermittent claudication. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class I)</em></strong> </li>
            <li>Aspirin (75 to 325 mg oral per day) has been recommended as a safe and cost effective option for symptomatic patients:

            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Consider clopidogrel (75 mg oral per day) as an alternative to aspirin to reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular deaths in patients with symptomatic LEAD or CLI. <strong><em>Level of evidence = B (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider a trial of prostanoids, which have shown some benefit in pain relief and wound healing for patients with CLI. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider a trial of pentoxifylline as a second-line therapy for patients with intermittent claudication. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class II)</em></strong> </li>
        <li>Consider angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g., Ramipril 10 mg oral per day) to reduce cardiovascular risks and improve pain-free walking time in patients with claudication. <strong><em>Level of evidence = A (Class II)</em></strong> </li>

<p>The primary authors of this guideline independently conducted searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases for studies published in English from January 2008 through June 2013. The following medical subject headings (MeSH) were used to search for each specific question related to lower-extremity arterial disease (LEAD)&amp;mdash;arterial disease, arterial insufficiency, peripheral arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease, lower-extremity arterial disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, lower-extremity ischemic wounds and ulcers, and critical limb ischemia (CLI).</p>
<p>The search targeted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective clinical trials and retrospective studies with at least 10 subjects, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. If available and relevant, national guidelines and published expert opinion were included to support expert opinion in areas that were clinically important where research was lacking or non-existent. Titles of references and abstracts were retrieved from the electronic searches and were screened for relevance to LEAD and the search questions, and in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the initial screening, full-text articles were obtained that met inclusion criteria. Additionally, some relevant studies were included that were identified from reference lists of selected articles.</p>

<p>From the selected, full-text articles, the primary authors extracted the following data: Source/citation (author, publication date, title, publication); type/design of study; methods (sample size, setting/location, description of subjects, interventions, tests/measures); results/findings including statistical significance of findings (<em>p</em> values, odds ratios, hazard ratios, confidence intervals, sensitivity/specificity, etc. as appropriate to the study); and conclusions. For studies of diagnostic or screening tests, data included if a valid reference standard was used. For systematic reviews/meta-analyses, data included number/quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reviewed, findings, and conclusions.</p>
<p>For each article, a narrative summary of the extracted data was prepared and reviewed by the primary authors and the final recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the task force. Based on judgment of the authors, studies were assessed as acceptable or unacceptable for inclusion and excluded if there were methodological issues or insufficient detail to evaluate the results. Additionally, the primary authors rated the research (Level I to Level VI) using criteria as identified in the preface of the original guideline document (Sackett, 1989; Cook, Guyatt, Laupacis, &amp;amp; Sackett, 1992). Any differences of opinion about the quality/rating of the studies for inclusion in the guideline were resolved by discussion between the primary authors or by consensus after a review and discussion by the full task force.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Synthesis and Evaluation of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The two primary authors synthesized the data and prepared a descriptive, narrative summary of the available evidence derived from the search and review of the literature. The lower-extremity arterial disease (LEAD) guideline is organized into a topical outline format that addresses key content areas for assessment and management of patients with or at risk for wounds due to LEAD. The summary of evidence derived from the review and evaluation of literature was integrated into the appropriate content sections of the guideline and a draft was presented to all task force members for review, discussion, clarification, and development of consensus. A series of conference calls was conducted during 2013 and 2014 and the task force reviewed/evaluated the evidence in the draft guideline until consensus was reached.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society (WOCN) developed this evidence-based guideline using the following process: (a) A task force of nurses from the WOCN membership, representing a wide range of experience and clinical practice backgrounds, convened to plan the guideline format; (b) a topical outline was designed and specific questions about lower-extremity arterial disease (LEAD) were proposed to guide the search of the literature for evidence; and (c) studies reporting primary data relevant to LEAD and specific therapies or diagnostic modalities were included in the review.</p>
<p>The task force developed the following questions to guide the evidence-based review of the literature:</p>
<p><strong>Screening and Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>What are the risk factors for LEAD? </li>

    <li>Who should have ABI screening? </li>
    <li>What indicators should be used to determine whether perfusion status is adequate, borderline or ischemic? </li>
    <li>What are the indicators of critical limb ischemia (CLI)? </li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Topical Wound Treatments</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>

    <li>What cleansing methods are appropriate for wounds due to LEAD? </li>
    <li>Is debridement indicated or contraindicated for wounds due to LEAD? What debridement methods are most appropriate? When are they indicated or contraindicated? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of Patients with LEAD</strong></p>

</ol>
<p>After the two primary authors reviewed the selected studies, the written summary of the evidence was presented to all task force members for review, discussion, clarification, and development of consensus. A series of conference calls was conducted during 2013, and the guideline was finalized incorporating evidence from the studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on the evidence in the guideline, recommendations were developed for specific areas where evidence was sufficient to support the recommendation.
