	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li>In adult and adolescent patients (&amp;ge;14 years of age) complaining of chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends that validated and reliable health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaires be used as the measurement of choice to assess the impact of cough on patients (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults and adolescents with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire and Leicester Cough Questionnaire, as they are the most extensively studied and commonly used previously validated and reliable cough-specific health-related QoL questionnaires to assess the impact of cough (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In children (&amp;lt;14 years of age) with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends that validated and reliable health-related QoL questionnaires be used as the measurement of choice to assess the impact of cough (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In children (&amp;lt;14 years of age) with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, the most extensively studied and commonly used previously validated and reliable health-related QoL questionnaire, as the measurement of choice to assess the impact of cough (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>To standardize the development, utilization, and reporting of cough-specific QoL questionnaires, the Expert Panel suggests that cough counting alone not be used to establish validity of the questionnaires (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>To standardize the development, use, and reporting of cough severity by visual analog scales (VASs) or numeric rating scales, the Expert Panel suggests that they be used in standard fashion (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>To ensure the integrity of health-related QoL questionnaires and other patient-reported outcomes that have been shown to be valid and reliable, the Expert Panel suggests that a modified version should not be used and reported unless the modified version has been shown to be reliable and valid (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult and adolescent patients with cough of any duration, the Expert Panel suggests that tussigenic challenges have a role in research settings to understand mechanisms of cough (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients of all ages, the Expert Panel recommends acoustic cough counting to assess cough frequency but not cough severity (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Investigators searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through June 2012 to identify English-language evaluative studies of instruments used to assess the frequency or impact of acute or chronic cough. Included studies had to (1) compare one cough assessment tool to another or to clinical assessment of cough or (2) evaluate change in response to treatment over time with a given tool.</p>
<p>The literature search began with the inception of these databases; the last literature search date for the CER was June 4, 2012. The literature search was subsequently updated by two authors of the CER, who are also members of the subcommittee on assessment of cough, using the same selection criteria used for the original CER project. This updated literature search identified 27 eligible studies published between June 2012 and November 2013, inclusive, that were not included in the CER.</p>
<p>The CER included an analytic framework constructed by using the general approach of specifying the population of interest, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing of outcomes, and settings (PICOTS) to address the following key question: In adults and adolescents (&amp;ge;14 years of age) and children (&amp;lt;14 years of age), what is the comparative diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic efficacy, and patient outcome efficacy of instruments used to assess cough? The criteria used to screen articles for inclusion and exclusion at both the title-and-abstract and the full-text screening stages are detailed in Table 1 in the original guideline document. Figure 1 in the original guideline document depicts this key question within the context of the PICOTS framework. The figure shows that the CER compared the diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic efficacy, and patient outcome efficacy of instruments to assess the severity, frequency, and impact of cough on patient outcomes. Subgroups considered included children aged, &amp;lt;14 years and patients with differing underlying cough etiologies. The subcommittee formulated the additional key clinical research questions presented in the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; section.</p></div>"/>

In brief, the approach required assessment of four domains: risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision. These domains were considered qualitatively, and a summary rating of high, moderate, or low strength of evidence was assigned after discussion by two reviewers (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). In some cases, high, moderate, or low ratings were impossible or imprudent to make. For example, when no evidence was available or when evidence on the outcome was too weak, sparse, or inconsistent to permit any conclusion to be drawn, a grade of insufficient was assigned. Two members of the subcommittee on assessment of cough revised the strength of evidence conclusions reported in the comparative effectiveness review (CER) to include additional information reported in the studies identified by the updated literature search. Prior to publication, experts reviewed this guideline and addressed all suggestions and criticisms.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The methodology used by the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel chair and the international panel of experts and to perform the synthesis of the evidence to develop the recommendations and suggestions has been previously published in the methodology and CHEST guideline development documents (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). In addition to the quality of the evidence, the recommendation grading also includes a strength of recommendation dimension (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). In the context of practice recommendations, a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and only applies to some patients. In the context of research recommendations, such as the ones in this guideline, the Expert Panel intended for a strong recommendation (grade 1) to imply that the Expert Panel recommend using a particular cough assessment in almost all the cases and instances where such a tool is being considered. The strength of recommendation here is based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations. Harms incorporate risks and burdens to the patient, which, for example, can include convenience or inconvenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness. These in turn affect patient preferences. The resource considerations go beyond economics and should factor in time and other indirect costs. The authors of these recommendations have considered these parameters in determining the strength of the recommendations and associated grades.</p>
<p>Key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for this topic. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality and were used to support the evidence-based graded recommendations or suggestions. A highly structured consensus-based (CB) Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. The total number of eligible voters for each guidance statement varied based on the number of managed individuals recused from voting on any particular statements because of their potential conflicts of interest (COIs). For example, four panel members were recused from developing and voting on the recommendations that included mentioning specific quality of life (QoL) instruments. Writing committee member COIs related to the recommendations were identified and are presented in a COI grid (see the online supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Transparency of process was documented. Further details of the methods have been published in the methodology and CHEST guideline development documents.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel convened a subcommittee to formulate recommendations or suggestions that pertain to the assessment of cough frequency and severity. This subcommittee on assessment of cough based its recommendations on a recently published comparative effectiveness review (CER) commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and a corresponding summary (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Various members of the Expert Cough Panel provided the stimulus for the AHRQ CER and were invited to participate as key informants, technical expert panelists, and peer reviewers.</p></div>"/>

<p>After publication, the guidelines were promoted to a wide audience of physicians, other health-care providers, and the public through multiple avenues. Press releases were prepared for both the lay and medical media, with major outreach efforts to all relevant print, broadcast, and Internet media. Panelists located in various large media markets were identified as potential spokespersons for interviews. Social media promotion was facilitated over Twitter, Facebook, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) e-Communities, internal and external blogs, and other communication routes. Blast communications were sent to CHEST members with links to the publication and postings on CHEST's Web site.</p>
<p>In addition to publication in <em>CHEST</em>, other derivative products were prepared to help with implementation, including slide sets, algorithms, and other clinical tools. These derivative products are posted on the CHEST Web site and will be made available in CHEST Guidelines. CHEST Guidelines will be the repository for the most current recommendations and suggestions from all CHEST guidelines, consensus statements, and hybrid documents. This online repository will also house a collection of related resources.</p>

<p>The authors have reported to <em>CHEST</em> the following conflicts of interest: Drs Coeytaux and McCrory are authors on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence report on which this guideline is based, and their efforts on this project were supported by a contract from AHRQ. Dr French is a codeveloper and co-copyright holder of the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. She has not received any financial compensation for Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire in &amp;gt;3 years. Dr Chang is a codeveloper of the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, a member of the advisory panel for the AHRQ systematic review on assessing cough severity, and a reviewer of the final AHRQ document. Dr Birring is a developer of the adult quality of life (QoL) and cough counting tools. Dr Smith has a patent for a cough counting device. Dr Irwin is a codeveloper and co-copyright holder of the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. He has not received any financial compensation for Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire in &amp;gt;3 years. Dr Irwin was also a member of the advisory panel for the AHRQ systematic review on assessing cough severity and a reviewer of the final AHRQ document. Although Dr Irwin is the Editor in Chief of <em>CHEST</em>, all reviews and decisions made concerning this manuscript were made by others, independent of Dr Irwin. Drs Boulet and Rubin and Ms Diekemper have reported that no potential conflicts of interest exist with any companies/organizations whose products or services may be discussed in this article.</p>
